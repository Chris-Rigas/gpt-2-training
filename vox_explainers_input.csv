"Ohio legislators last month introduced a measure that would, if passed, become the most restrictive abortion law in the country.
The bill creates a new felony called â€œabortion murder,â€ making people who have or perform abortions subject to life in prison. It also includes a provision suggesting that doctors should attempt to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy in a patientâ€™s uterus, a procedure medical experts say is not possible with current medical technology.
The legislation has not yet received a vote, but itâ€™s already generated controversy around the world. For its sponsor, Ohio State Rep. Candice Keller, itâ€™s a way to root out abortion in her state once and for all: â€œThe time for regulating evil and compromise is over,â€ she said in a November statement.
But abortion-rights advocates say the bill puts Ohioans at risk of being jailed over an abortion or even dying as a result of an untreated ectopic pregnancy. â€œIf this bill was to become law, the lives of anyone who can become pregnant would be endangered,â€ Lauren Blauvelt-Copelin, vice president of government affairs and public advocacy at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio, told Vox.
Ohio has been the source of bills in the past that, initially disregarded as extreme, ended up becoming law: the first so-called â€œheartbeatâ€ bill, banning abortion around six weeks into pregnancy, was introduced there in 2011. In 2018 and 2019, such laws passed not just in Ohio but in Iowa, Georgia, and elsewhere (though all have for now been blocked by courts).
Now, advocates say Ohio is again at the forefront of a drive to restrict abortion â€” this time, one that could erode protections for the life and health of pregnant people. Bills like the one in Ohio are meant to give fetuses and even fertilized eggs the same legal rights as pregnant people themselves, Mary Alice Carter, a senior adviser at the reproductive-rights group Equity Forward, told Vox. â€œWhen we do that, we create a very dangerous situation for people that are pregnant.â€
The Ohio bill includes a provision for reimplanting an ectopic pregnancy, a procedure that doesnâ€™t exist
Ohio House Bill 413, introduced on November 18, is 723 pages long. The bill has gotten attention in part for its striking language â€” it creates a new felony called â€œabortion murder.â€ Under the legislation, people would be guilty of this crime if they purposely â€œperform or have an abortion,â€ and could face 15 years to life in prison.
The bill also creates a crime called â€œaggravated abortion murder,â€ of which people could be found guilty if they â€œpurposely perform an abortion while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary,â€ or other crimes. For aggravated abortion murder, the maximum penalty is death.
The circumstances under which someone could be accused of aggravated abortion murder are somewhat unclear. â€œShow me the person that can perform an abortion while committing arson, and Iâ€™ll show you a person who is remarkably good at multitasking,â€ Imani Gandy wrote at Rewire.News.
But the new crimes are notable in large part because they would apparently allow patients to be charged with a felony for ending their pregnancies. A spokesperson for Keller told Vox that â€œthe intent of the bill is towards the doctors, itâ€™s not toward punishing the women that are going through these crisis situations.â€ But as written, the bill would appear to allow Ohioans to be sentenced to life in prison for getting an abortion.
Mainstream anti-abortion groups typically do not support punishments for pregnant people who seek or get abortions. But Ohio isnâ€™t the first state to introduce the possibility of such punishment â€” a Texas bill introduced earlier this year would make it possible for people who get abortions to be sentenced to death.
Ohio does appear to be first in something else, however. HB 413 includes an exception for doctors who perform an abortion in order to save a patientâ€™s life. In order to be exempt from prosecution, though, the doctor must take â€œall possible steps to preserve the life of the unborn child, while preserving the life of the woman.â€
Such steps, the law states, â€œinclude, if applicable, attempting to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into the womanâ€™s uterus.â€
Doctors, however, say no procedure to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into a womanâ€™s uterus exists. Ectopic pregnancies happen when a fertilized egg attaches, not to the uterine wall, but elsewhere in the reproductive system, usually in a fallopian tube. These pregnancies are not viable, and if left untreated, they can result in a ruptured fallopian tube, hemorrhage, and even death. In most cases, doctors say the only treatment is to terminate the pregnancy with medication or surgery.
However, thereâ€™s a growing movement among abortion opponents to argue that ectopic pregnancies can be moved and reimplanted. Earlier this year, writer Georgi Boorman at the conservative website the Federalist mentioned the possibility as part of a larger argument that abortion in the case of ectopic pregnancies was unnecessary. Medical professionals â€” including some who identify as pro-life â€” responded that reimplantation is not possible. â€œTo my knowledge we are nowhere near having the technology to do that,â€ Ingrid Skop, chair of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told Vox at the time.
Boorman ended up issuing a retraction and apology. But she wasnâ€™t the only one talking about the idea of reimplantation. The idea had already made its way into a different Ohio bill, this one restricting insurance coverage for abortion. The bill contained a special provision allowing insurance companies to cover â€œa procedure for an ectopic pregnancy that is intended to reimplant the fertilized ovum into the pregnant womanâ€™s uterus.â€
The sponsor of that bill, Republican Ohio State Rep. John Becker, is a co-sponsor of HB 413 as well.
It could be part of a nationwide trend toward banning abortion with no exceptions â€” even for a pregnant personâ€™s life
Neither bill has yet passed, and supporters say theyâ€™re just looking to the future, when reimplantation could be possible. â€œIf there is a way to save both mother and child, weâ€™d like to see that demonstrated,â€ the Keller spokesperson told Vox.
But others say the emphasis on a medical procedure that doesnâ€™t exist could set a dangerous precedent. Language about reimplantation â€” along with the broader argument that abortion is not necessary in cases of ectopic pregnancy â€” could result in a narrowing of protections for the life and health of pregnant people in abortion law, Carter, the Equity Forward adviser, said.
The current standard of care for ectopic pregnancies in most cases is to treat them with medication or surgery as soon as they are identified, Carter noted. But by introducing the idea that ectopic pregnancies can be saved, abortion opponents could push doctors to wait until a patient is near death before taking action â€” potentially making serious or even fatal complications more likely.
And ultimately, the focus on ectopic pregnancies may be part of a larger argument that abortion is never necessary, even to save a personâ€™s life. Keller, the sponsor of HB 413, said in November that â€œthe time has come to abolish abortion in its entirety and recognize that each individual has the inviolable and inalienable right to life.â€
While the Ohio bills appear to be the first in the country to include language around ectopic pregnancy, the idea could spread, abortion-rights advocates say.
â€œOhio has been a breeding ground for very dangerous anti-abortion, anti-reproductive health bans and restrictionsâ€ in the past, Blauvelt-Copelin, the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio vice president, said. She noted that the first-ever â€œheartbeatâ€ bill, banning abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat can be detected, was introduced in Ohio in 2011. The bill didnâ€™t pass at the time and wasnâ€™t even supported by some anti-abortion groups in the state.
But over time, such legislation, which bans abortion at as early as six weeksâ€™ gestation, before many people know they are pregnant, gained traction around the country, and similar bans have now passed in multiple states.
Something similar happened with the idea of exceptions in abortion law for people who become pregnant as a result of rape or incest. A few years ago, Carter said, most abortion opponents accepted the idea that abortion restrictions should include such exceptions. Now, several laws around the country, including a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in Alabama, have no exception for rape or incest. A similar thing could happen with exceptions for the health and life of the pregnant person, Carter said: â€œWhat weâ€™re seeing is an upping of the ante.â€
The Alabama law and all of the six-week bans have been blocked by courts, and Blauvelt-Copelin said that if HB 413 were to pass, Planned Parenthood would fight it in court as well. However, she said, â€œwe see that this is the direction that anti-abortion politicians want to move our state and our country in, so we have to take these bills very seriously.â€"
"The most anticipated Warner Bros. superhero flick is one that might not even exist: the infamous â€œSnyder Cutâ€ of the movie Justice League. Itâ€™s an alleged version of director Zack Snyderâ€™s Justice League that has become something of a myth among fans.
Diehard DC Comics fans will tell you that the fabled Snyder Cut is exactly the Justice League story fans wanted: a darker, more cohesive, and overall better directorâ€™s version that completely changes the movie for the better.
Whispers of a possible Snyder Cut began soon after Justice League hit theaters in November 2017. The movie that we got, according to Snyderâ€™s biggest fans, is a twisted, gnarled, ignorant work that was knee-capped by outside forces that suffocated Snyderâ€™s true vision. And since its release, a hashtag movement has simmered, bubbling up with each Warner Bros. premiere with increasing fervor.
Coinciding with the two-year anniversary of Justice Leagueâ€™s theatrical release, last month the Snyder Cut â€” which until now has mostly existed as a myth spread by word of mouth among fans â€” was one of those instances.
On November 15, Snyder posted pictures on the social media platform Vero, images that fans quickly believed were from the Snyder Cut itself: a still of Henry Cavillâ€™s Superman in the heroâ€™s trademark uniform, and another of the character in what appears to be a resurrection scene that differs from the one in the original Justice League.

The shots Snyder posted might seem like typical superhero-movie fare of an actor in costume. But to devoted fans, the stills are evidence that the superior Snyder Cut does exist, and that itâ€™s just being withheld from the public for whatever reason.
Adding fuel to the fire were tweets from former Batman actor Ben Affleck and Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot on November 17. Affleck, who vacated the Batman post after Justice League, simply tweeted the hashtag #ReleaseTheSnyderCut:
Gadot tweeted a black-and-white image of her character looking wistful, using the same hashtag:
Despite Warner Bros.â€™s seeming non-interest in releasing a cut, Snyder has continued to prod the studio. On December 4, a couple of weeks after the anniversary of Justice Leagueâ€™s release, Snyder went even further: He posted images of reels that purport to be his directorâ€™s cut of Justice League.

For both the director and the superheroes themselves to be spreading the hashtag has given whatâ€™s been dubbed the â€œRelease the Snyder Cutâ€ movement more legitimacy than ever before. Itâ€™s one thing to have DC Comics enthusiasts get the hashtag trending, but Gadot and Affleck are actual Justice League members.
If even they want the Snyder Cut released, is the fan-driven movement onto something? Could the Snyder Cut really exist?
Warner Bros. hasnâ€™t officially addressed the campaign, which has expanded beyond tweets and hashtags to include real-life demonstrations and events held by wanting fans. But according to the Hollywood Reporterâ€™s sources at the company, thereâ€™s no imminent plan to release any such cut â€” nor has the studio confirmed it even exists.
DC Comics fansâ€™ interest in an alternate, higher-quality version of the poorly received team-up movie is natural, especially when stars and the filmâ€™s own director say one exists. But the â€œRelease the Snyder Cutâ€ campaign has darker motives too, as it galvanizes the fandomâ€™s toxic sect, which has previously clung to conspiracy theories about film criticism and the business of Hollywood that threaten to damage the reputations of all of the above.
#ReleaseTheSnyderCut is a genius marketing push â€” if thatâ€™s all it is
The origin story of the Snyder Cut starts in May 2017, when Snyder left the Justice League project just before reshoots to deal with the death of his daughter. (There are reports that dispute this and claim Snyder was fired much earlier, however.) Avengers director Joss Whedon was called in to handle the movieâ€™s numerous reshoots. The reshoots with which Snyder was reportedly uninvolved, combined with fan theories that Warner Bros. was rushing the film to meet a year-end release date, led fans to believe the finished product had strayed from Snyderâ€™s original vision.
Perhaps â€œRelease the Snyder Cutâ€ wouldnâ€™t have become such a rallying cry if Justice League had been more successful.
After months of anticipation, Justice League turned out to be a critical and box-office disappointment. The more time that passed, the more fans blamed Snyderâ€™s departure and Warner Bros. for its failure. In response, their hopes for some unannounced directorâ€™s cut of the film grew. Snyder fans consider his previous directorsâ€™ cuts of 2009â€™s Watchmen and 2016â€™s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice to be improvements upon the theatrical versions, and that fueled a belief that a similar redux of Justice League would also be much more satisfying.
An online petition by one fan in late 2017 that asked for a directorâ€™s cut garnered over 179,000 signatures. That kicked off a full-on movement that, among other things, spurred a site called ForSnyderCut.com, which become a centralized hub for all Snyder Cut news. Then there was a January 2018 â€œmarchâ€ on Warner Bros.â€™s Burbank studio to show how serious fans were, along with YouTube videos (in many languages), letters, and phone calls to Warner Bros. itself.
The Ringer has a good breakdown of the various teases Snyder himself has participated in to further fan the flames. Fans sunk their teeth into every one, culminating in a nearly $27,000 GoFundMe campaign to fly a banner at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. It wasnâ€™t until March 2019 (just prior to the GoFundMe campaign) that Snyder confirmed the existence of his directorâ€™s cut to a fan while attending a fundraiser for the ArtCenter College of Designâ€™s Ahmanson Auditorium:
Gadot, the flagship actress of Warner Bros.â€™s superhero universe, tweeting about the Snyder Cut is another sign of how much this movement has grown â€” and the possibility that the edit may eventually see the light of day.
But despite the star-studded endorsements and Snyderâ€™s crafty hints, including the images heâ€™s posted on social media, only a few people have said theyâ€™ve seen the cut. Most of its existence hinges on the word of Snyder himself or secondhand accounts. And others, like director (and early champion of the â€œRelease the Snyder Cutâ€ movement) Kevin Smith, say theyâ€™ve heard the cut isnâ€™t in cinematic shape to actually screen.
â€œThere is a Snyder Cut. For sure. Thatâ€™s not a mythical beast. It exists. Now, itâ€™s not a finished movie by any stretch of the imagination,â€ Smith told CinemaBlend earlier this year. â€œThe â€˜Snyder Cutâ€™ that, again I havenâ€™t seen, but the one Iâ€™ve heard everyone speak of was never a finished film. It was a movie that people in production could watch and fill in the blanks. It was certainly not meant for mass consumption.â€
The rumors kept moving closer to home throughout 2019. In August, Aquaman actor Jason Momoa posted on Instagram that Snyder let him see the cut and that it was, in Momoaâ€™s words, â€œssssiiicccckkkkkkâ€:

Well letâ€™s be honest if it wasnâ€™t for this man we wouldnâ€™t have Aquaman I love u Zachary synder. Mahalo for showing me the synder cut. Here is a token of my appreciation. Leica Q2 for inspiring me as an artist through and through @leicacamerausa I wish I was a better actor but I canâ€™t lie. The Snyder cut is ssssiiicccckkkkkk #luckymesucksforu #q2 #leicaforlife @cruelfilms aloha j
A post shared by Jason Momoa (@prideofgypsies) on Aug 18, 2019 at 5:41pm PDT
Itâ€™s worth keeping in mind that Momoa and Gadot are still playing the heroes they portrayed in Justice League in upcoming standalone sequels. Drumming up interest in Justice League also drums up interest in their upcoming projects; tweeting about the Snyder Cut keeps their names in the news.
Supporting the Snyder Cut shows they also care about what fans want. These actors are essentially saying, without explicitly doing so, that they want the best for their fans. And since Justice League was so universally trashed, Gadot and Momoa arenâ€™t really burning bridges by saying a better version of that movie exists somewhere.
When Wonder Woman 1984 comes out in June 2020, fans will likely remember that Gadot asked for the Snyder Cut to be released. And Gadot will likely be asked about the Snyder Cut again during that press tour.
Even if the Snyder Cut is never released, the Justice League stars who support the movement will have garnered goodwill from fans.
But releasing the Snyder Cut also courts a toxic aspect to this fervent fandom
Gadot and Momoaâ€™s support may be good for them, but itâ€™s not great for those who are less concerned about the Snyder Cut. Despite the motivation or intent behind the Snyder Cut campaign â€” and regardless of the shape itâ€™s in, if it does exist â€” itâ€™s worth noting that some of the fans involved have gained a bad reputation. Their demands for the Snyder Cutâ€™s release have grown more intense, and itâ€™s emblematic of how toxic some fandoms have become in the past decade.
The #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement frames the scenario to make it seem like Warner Bros. is keeping fans from the high-quality superhero movie they desire. The movement is not simply about wanting a directorâ€™s cut to be made available.
Rather, its supporters actually use the phrase to suggest that Warner Bros. executives like ex-DC Entertainment president Geoff Johns (who takes the brunt of the fansâ€™ blame for Justice League, since itâ€™s theorized he sabotaged Snyderâ€™s vision because it was incongruent with his own); reshoots helmer Joss Whedon; and even Marvel Entertainment, film critics, and many people in between all have it out for Snyder fans. They donâ€™t care whether fans get a good movie out of Justice League, a beloved property many DC Comics fans wanted to see adapted for years. They just care about making money.
This notion continues to send fans on the more paranoid side of the argument into attack mode online:
The online harassment has grown so fierce that a former DC exec deleted her Twitter in fall 2018 to avoid the rage in her mentions. A year prior, a writer from Pajiba received an avalanche of vitriol for criticizing the campaign online.
The reaction, albeit far more intense than previous Snyder-fan antics, is nothing new. Itâ€™s reminiscent of the great conspiracy theory of 2016, when a vocal sect of DC and Warner Bros. fans were convinced that Marvel had paid off critics to trash Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Supplemental to that theory is the narrative pushed by Snyder that his movies are made for fans, not critics.
The Snyder Cut contingent subsist on an â€œus versus themâ€ mentality, where if you arenâ€™t a fan of these poor movies, you must not be a â€œrealâ€ fan of the heroes themselves. Real fans are the ones who matter, of course. Brushing off negative criticism becomes a lot easier when itâ€™s coming from people who arenâ€™t real fans.
This creates a strange paradox of sorts in that true fans ostensibly should enjoy the Justice League movie no matter what, according to Snyder himself. But Snyder Cut fans will argue that the movie they were served was actually the work of other people â€” Whedon especially â€” and that they never got to see Snyderâ€™s vision.
Hating Justice League means hating everything that was tinkered with. The Snyder Cut is what â€œrealâ€ fans should want.
Pitting fans against critics and movie execs reflexively creates an environment in which a silly idea like Marvel paying off the media to trash Warner Bros. takes flight. It also encourages some fans to verbally abuse anyone with a negative opinion of the movie or a Warner Bros. property.
Just prior to the release of Octoberâ€™s Joker, fans sent misogynistic tweets and emails â€” some that vaguely warned of theater shootings â€” to critics who saw the movie and gave it a poor review. This behavior continues and, in some ways, is entrenched in modern fandom culture, particularly among fans of DC superhero movies, which have suffered poor reviews over the years.
With stars like Affleck, Gadot, and Momoa urging Warner Bros. to release the Snyder Cut of Justice League, it seems like it would be in the companyâ€™s best interest to eventually release it â€” if that edit of the film does exist in some watchable form. There are countless fans who want it and the studio could cash in, especially on the anniversary of the movie. I wouldnâ€™t be opposed to seeing more of Gadot and Momoa superhero-ing.
But thereâ€™s also a question of what happens after fans â€” especially the particularly toxic ones â€” get what they want. They could very well see the release of a Snyder Cut as something they earned by acting and lashing out, as though Warner Bros. is caving in to their demands or rewarding their bad behavior. And itâ€™s hard to believe thatâ€™s the best course of action."
"In addition to summing up the findings from weeks of testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, Intelligence Committee Democratsâ€™ new report has a surprising inclusion â€” the phone records of several major players involved in the scandal, including President Trumpâ€™s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), a member of the committee, confirmed on CNN that investigators subpoenaed these phone records. And while the records canâ€™t reveal what was actually said during these phone calls, they make clear that Giuliani was in close contact with the White House at key moments.
Giuliani also exchanged several calls with an unknown number identified in the report as â€œ-1â€ â€” and though this isnâ€™t confirmed, the report certainly seems to imply that this number is President Trump.
The records also raise further questions about the potential involvement of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the Intelligence Committeeâ€™s top Republican, in the Ukraine affair. He has been accused of participating in the push for Ukrainian investigations into Trumpâ€™s rivals, and the records show he exchanged calls with Giuliani and his â€œfixerâ€ Lev Parnas (who was arrested in October for campaign finance violations).
Overall, though, the records serve to remind us that, despite all the text messages and witness testimony weâ€™ve seen so far in the inquiry, thereâ€™s a circle of people at the center of this scandal whose actions, and communications, remain mysterious. And more broadly, itâ€™s just rather remarkable that impeachment investigators managed to obtain the phone records of the presidentâ€™s personal lawyer.
The records shed light on the campaign against Ambassador Yovanovitch
The Democratsâ€™ report refers many times to a â€œschemeâ€ carried out by President Trump and his allies to try and get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. And in their telling, this scheme began with an effort to oust the US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who was standing in the way of these demands.
The outlines will be familiar to those who watched Yovanovitchâ€™s testimony: Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko, spoke with Giuliani and Giulianiâ€™s fixer Lev Parnas, making false accusations against Yovanovitch and claiming there were scandals involving the Bidens. John Solomon, a conservative journalist, then wrote up Lutsenkoâ€™s claims for the Hill beginning in March. Then, in late April, Yovanovitch suddenly got word she was being recalled from her post, at the White Houseâ€™s instruction.
The new phone records in the report add further detail to this story, and document contacts between the key players at important moments. For instance, Democrats say:
In the 48 hours before Solomon published his first article based on Lutsenkoâ€™s claims, Parnas spoke with Solomon at least six times. They spoke another time after the article, which attacked Yovanovitch, went live.
Between April 1 and April 7, Parnas exchanged about 16 calls with Giuliani and about 10 with Solomon. On April 7, Solomon published another article attacking Yovanovitch.
On April 10, Giuliani or Parnas exchanged calls with Solomon and with two other key players here â€” conservative lawyer Victoria Toensing, who was reportedly working with Giuliani on the Ukraine dirt-digging operation, and Rep. Devin Nunes.
Then, on April 12, there are a series of calls, each involving either Giuliani or Parnas, and the following other people or numbers:
a â€œWhite House phone numberâ€
an â€œOMB phone numberâ€ (potentially acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is still the OMB director)
â€œ-1â€ (an unknown number, which may, from context, be President Trump)
Victoria Toensing
John Solomon
Devin Nunes
Jay Sekulow, another lawyer for Trump
On April 21, however, outsider reformer Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidential election. In the days after that, Giuliani and his allies moved against Yovanovitch. The phone records for April 23 and 24 show the following:
Multiple calls between Giuliani and Parnas
A call between Parnas and Solomon
Several short Giuliani calls to the White House, followed quickly by a call back for him from an unknown â€œ-1â€ number
A call from Giuliani to a phone associated with then-National Security Adviser John Bolton
Three calls from Giuliani to an OMB number (which again, could be Mulvaney), and eight with a White House number
Finally, on the night of April 24, a State Department official called Yovanovitch and told her she had to return to Washington, due to White House â€œconcerns.â€ Those concerns, another State official later explained to her, were coming from President Trump.
None of this is surprising, exactly â€” but in filling out the story of what happened, itâ€™s useful to show that Giuliani was calling the White House right before Yovanovitch was recalled.
Giuliani responded by tweeting, â€œThe mere fact I had numerous calls with the White House does not establish any specific topic. Remember, Iâ€™m the Presidentâ€™s attorney.â€ That is true. But the Democratsâ€™ report also cited Giulianiâ€™s tweets and media appearances to establish what may have been on his mind around the time of these calls â€” and, usually, it was Ukraine.
Why â€œ-1â€ often appears to be President Trump
While the Democratsâ€™ report doesnâ€™t outright say that the calls coming from the unknown â€œ-1â€ number are from President Trump, they certainly imply it â€” and the context shows thatâ€™s with good reason.
The key is what happens before the â€œ-1â€ calls. Take, for instance, these records from on August 8.
In them:
Giuliani initially texts the White House
A little over an hour later, Giuliani gets a flurry of calls from â€œ-1â€ to two different cell phones (the calls have very short durations so he appears not to have picked up).
But minutes later, Giuliani then calls three numbers in succession â€” one listed as an â€œOMB numberâ€ (for the White House Office of Management and Budget), one for the Situation Roomâ€™s White House Switchboard, and one for the White House Switchboard. On the third, he connects.
Then, in a call highlighted in the report, a â€œ-1â€ unknown number calls Giuliani back and they speak for over four minutes.
So this certainly seems like a series of efforts from Trump and Giuliani to get in touch with each other, eventually succeeding. (The â€œOMB numberâ€ could be for acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who is still technically the director of OMB.)
Obviously, weâ€™d expect Trump to be talking to his lawyer on the phone. Thatâ€™s not scandalous in and of itself. But the placement and timing of these calls involving â€œ-1â€ may be informative.
For instance, the series of calls on August 8 happened shortly after Giuliani met an aide to Zelensky in Madrid, and shortly before Giuliani, Gordon Sondland, and Kurt Volker started trying to dictate a statement for Zelensky in which he would commit to the investigations. So a phone call here could suggest that Trump was in the loop â€” and that Giuliani was speaking for him. (Though, theoretically, it could have been about another topic.)
Finally, one other reason why the â€œ-1â€ number may be Trump is that we actually know heâ€™s used a blocked number that shows up in other phone records this way. During the recent trial of Trumpâ€™s longtime adviser Roger Stone, prosecutors revealed that Trumpâ€™s phone had a blocked number in 2016, and showed up on Stoneâ€™s phone records as â€œ-1.â€

The role of Devin Nunes
Finally, the phone records have also focused renewed attention on the possible role of Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, in this whole saga.
As mentioned above, Nunes and Giuliani exchanged a series of brief calls on April 10. Theoretically, they could have been talking about any number of matters.
So itâ€™s even more interesting that Nunes was also in contact with Giulianiâ€™s fixer for Ukraine, Lev Parnas. On April 12 â€” amidst Parnasâ€™s calls with Giuliani, Victoria Toensing, and John Solomon â€” Parnas also traded calls with Nunes, eventually speaking with him for about eight-and-half minutes.
Giuliani also had a series of contacts with Nunes or people close to Nunes around the time of his aborted trip to Ukraine this May.
For instance, on May 8, according to the report, Giuliani separately spoke on the phone with someone at the White House, with Solomon, with Parnas â€” and Nunes staffer Derek Harvey.
Then, on May 9, the New York Times revealed that Giuliani was planning a trip to Kyiv, to urge the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens. â€œWeâ€™re not meddling in an election, weâ€™re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,â€ Giuliani told the paper.
The next day, May 10, Giuliani traded calls with and eventually spoke with Kashyap â€œKashâ€ Patel â€” a former Nunes aide who is now an NSC staffer. A call from the â€œ-1â€ number went to Giuliani shortly afterward.
Shortly afterward, Giuliani spoke with Parnas. And that night, on Fox News, Giuliani announced he was calling off his trip to Ukraine.
Parnasâ€™s attorney has previously claimed Nunes was in the loop for the Ukrainian dirt-digging effort, and these call records could well corroborate that statement. Nunes, of course, did not disclose any of this during the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s hearings on the impeachment inquiry, during which he has argued the president has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine."
"Baby Yoda is perfection, and I wonâ€™t hear otherwise. Not that Iâ€™m worried anyone will disagree, because this is one take the world seems to stand behind.
The TV show that birthed him, the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian, got off to a slow start, in part because itâ€™s full of big-name character actors playing unfamiliar intergalactic heroes and villains. But the final moment of its otherwise unexciting premiere gave many Star Wars fans a sign that The Mandalorian would be more than an expensive exercise in bringing the franchise to streaming TV.
When the Mandalorian saved an infant in a floating bassinet from certain death at the end of the episode, the infant was revealed to be a lot more recognizable â€” and adorable â€” than the rest of the showâ€™s new heroes and villains. Because that infant looked a heckuva lot like Yoda, in especially cute baby form.
As far as we know, this character is not the 900-year-old green wiseman that Star Wars fans have long revered; Yoda himself died at the end of Return of the Jedi, which is set five years before the start of The Mandalorian. But the youngster appears to be from the same species as Yoda. And as we learned in episode two, thereâ€™s much more to him than his resemblance to one of Star Warsâ€™s most beloved characters: Referred to on the show as â€œthe Child,â€ he is 50 years old, so still a baby in Yoda years. But heâ€™s shockingly powerful for someone who appears to be just an infant, able to use the Force to take down giant beasts.
We all want to protect Baby Yoda. Heâ€™s baby! Lucasfilm / Walt Disney Pictures via Disney+
This makes him a great companion for the Mandalorian, whoâ€™s committed to protecting Baby Yoda from the dangers of the galaxy after members of what remains of the evil Empire offered him a hefty bounty for bringing the Child to them. The Mandalorian quickly fell in love with the sweet, cooing infant, and refused to let him become little more than a trophy for unfeeling villains.
So did viewers. Predictably, the fact that this big-eyed, big-headed, pure-hearted alien isnâ€™t actually Yoda hasnâ€™t stopped people from dubbing him Baby Yoda. And Baby Yoda has since become an online phenomenon.
Memes, odes to his cuteness, and fanart have spread widely across Twitter and other corners of the internet since The Mandalorianâ€™s November 12 debut, especially after he was granted more screen time in episodes two, three, and four. The character seems to have broadened interest in the show immensely. He clearly appeals not just to Star Wars fans, but a bigger demographic: lovers of all things tiny, baby, wholesome, and adorable.
To many, Baby Yoda is a bright spot in a slow-going series
If The Mandalorian hadnâ€™t leaned into Baby Yoda as hard as it has â€” by giving him plenty of screen time in the episodes following the premiere â€” thereâ€™s a chance no one would even be talking about him right now.
Disney hyped up the series ahead of its debut as a live-action Star Wars TV show of grand scale, a first for the franchise. Previous efforts to translate Star Wars for live-action television have notoriously fizzled out, like the aborted Star Wars: Underworld project of the mid-aughts. But The Mandalorian had much more promise from the start.
Disney assembled a team that gave the show immediate credibility: Jon Favreau (Iron Man) as showrunner, a cast that includes Carl Weathers and Werner Herzog, and episode directors like Rick Famuyiwa (Dope) and Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok; Jojo Rabbit) among them. Early promotional photos teased a project reminiscent of the Star Wars movies themselves: There were sandy dunes, a variety of aliens, and plenty of droids. And the mysterious main character (played by Pedro Pascal) was shown to be a bounty hunter in the vein of fan-favorite villains Boba and Jango Fett. What wasnâ€™t to love?

But critics raised plenty of complaints when The Mandalorian debuted as the crown jewel of Disney+â€™s original programming lineup. Vox critic at large Emily VanDerWerff called the first episode â€œfundamentally empty entertainment and not a great harbinger for many Disney+ original programs to come.â€ Slate described it as â€œtruncated and half-sketched.â€ Entertainment Weekly wrote that â€œthis was a very strange debut, merging grim toughness with mawkish softening twists.â€
The negative response hinged on the concern that The Mandalorian would inch toward its meaningful reveals, a questionable approach to a story whose heroâ€™s primary trait is how little is known about him. (It didnâ€™t help that Disney+ chose not to screen the series for critics ahead of its debut, which didnâ€™t give them anything to go on beyond the first episode.)
Baby Yoda, at least, was a point of interest. Some spoiler-y reviews of his surprise introduction made mention of the babyâ€™s appearance more dismissively, writing off the character as an obvious marketing ploy or cheap and unoriginal twist. Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone wrote that â€œEven the twist at the very end â€” that the Mandalorianâ€™s latest target is a baby from the same species as Yoda â€” echoes the plot of the Clone Wars film.â€ VanDerWerff suggested at Vox that â€œYouâ€™re probably just seeing the big-eyed, big-eared baby alien as yet another merchandising opportunity.â€

Indeed, right before the release of episode three, reports emerged that Baby Yoda merchandise would be hitting shelves soon, apparently after a purposeful delay intended to help â€œpreserve the surprise of the characterâ€™s reveal.â€ As it turns out, â€œsoonâ€ may not arrive until May 2020, according to product pages for dolls and other merch inspired by the character â€” but they are at least in the works.
And when they do hit shelves, those toys will land in a world where Baby Yoda is already a more fleshed-out character than some critics expected.
Ever since the twist of the characterâ€™s introduction, The Mandalorian has worked to ensure that Baby Yoda is more than a merch tie-in. In episode two, fittingly called â€œThe Child,â€ the show made it clear that this baby is a meaningful part of its story.
The Mandalorian is ostensibly focused on its title character, but in â€œThe Child,â€ every move the title character made was followed by the camera holding on Baby Yodaâ€™s reaction, with clear affection for his emotive blue eyes and goofy oversized coat. When the Mandalorian boarded his ship, Baby Yoda waddled along behind him. (The character was brought to life through a combination of animatronic puppeteering and computer-generated graphics, lending a nice sense of practicality to his movements.) When the Mandalorian got roughed up in a fight while trying to protect his ship, Baby Yoda outstretched his little arm to reach for his new friend. When the Mandalorian was busy fighting some bad guys, the show paused to let us know what Baby Yoda was up to, and it turned out he was eating a frog that made him sick. (Heâ€™s even cute when heâ€™s sick!)
All of these scenes added lighthearted moments to a series that had initially come off as meditative, if not quite dour. The addition of a pure-hearted baby alleviated the solitude and tension that inevitably accompanies a story of a silent bounty hunter.
It also made The Mandalorian instantly more memorable and evocative. So few events occurred in episode one that it quickly escaped recall, but â€œThe Childâ€ began to properly introduce this likable mystery character with an apparent tie to one of Star Warsâ€™s most beloved figures. Episode three, â€œThe Sin,â€ further balanced Baby Yodaâ€™s extreme cuteness with intrigue well enough to prove that his appeal is no fluke â€” by putting him in real danger and introducing life-or-death stakes that forced the stoic Mandalorian into full-on Good Dad mode to make sure the kid stayed alive.
And then came episode four, â€œThe Sanctuary,â€ which focused on the father-son dynamic between the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda. Having this paternal role to play has made the bounty hunter a much softer, even occasionally lighthearted character. Consider the moment when he orders Baby Yoda a cup of soup and instructs the child to stay put while he steps away to track down an adversary ... only for Baby Yoda to appear in the middle of the fight, sipping his beloved hot meal.
Baby Yodaâ€™s wide eyes and cute quirks have won over not just viewers, but The Mandalorianâ€™s cast and crew. Bryce Dallas Howard, who directed episode four, called the character â€œthe light of all of our lives,â€ adding that â€œitâ€™s so exhilarating to be able to share my love and obsession with him with others.â€ And Werner Herzog, who plays a man known as the Client, has admitted that Baby Yoda made him â€œcry,â€ which encapsulates his power better than anything.
Entertainment outlets are eager to celebrate the Baby Yoda goodness. Vox is not immune to that impulse, clearly! Because at least one staffer (me) would die to protect Baby Yoda, in an instant. Heâ€™s a new friend who is feeling out a world that evil bounty hunters didnâ€™t want him to survive in. How could anyone not love a creature this cute?
The desire to protect Baby Yoda at all costs has been the dominant response from Mandalorian viewers and non-viewers alike, as fans have waxed poetic about the characterâ€™s button nose and shining eyes online.
Actress Elisabeth Moss of The Handmaidâ€™s Tale and Mad Men fame said that Baby Yoda has â€œunited the country, while Vultureâ€™s Jen Chaney wrote after episode two that â€œthe bottom line is that Baby Yoda is the best part of The Mandalorian so far, and right now, the main thing persuading me to watch more episodes.â€
At Wired, Emmy Grey Ellis acknowledged that a contingent of haters are protesting against Baby Yoda as nothing more than marketing â€” and then argued that â€œBaby Yoda is, in fact, so lovable that its lovability is evidence of storytellers and character designers at the peak of their powers.â€
Ellis continued: â€œTypically, building a character out of elements people are sure to adore is a ticket to Try-Hardsville. ... Baby Yoda is different. The character is simply a mashup of the most beloved being in the Star Wars universe, Disneyâ€™s cuteness formula, and a superbaby.â€
Baby Yoda has definitely cemented The Mandalorian as one of the cutest shows on streaming, against all odds. But his cuteness is only one reason why Baby Yoda fever has exploded. Another reason is that Disney made a very smart move in choosing to unveil the character the way it did, and meting out his development by releasing The Mandalorian one episode at a time.
Baby Yodaâ€™s secret weapon: The Mandalorianâ€™s release schedule
Disney+ launched on a Tuesday, along with the first episodes of its initial wave of exclusive original programming. The most advertised of the lot was The Mandalorian, what with the weight of Star Wars and a $100 million budget behind it.
Disney had announced in late August that it would release new episodes of its original Disney+ series weekly, rather than drop the season all at once.
But the company did launch The Mandalorian (and other Disney+ originals) on a slightly compressed schedule, with the second episode premiering just three days after the first. Subsequent new episodes have premiered on Fridays, a schedule that will continue through the rest of season one. This ended up being a smart play by Disney, especially in the wake of criticsâ€™ reactions to The Mandalorianâ€™s first episode.
By launching the showâ€™s first two installments so close together, Disney encouraged viewers to at least give The Mandalorianâ€™s first two episodes a shot. Itâ€™s hard to say whether skeptics who raised an eyebrow at Baby Yodaâ€™s surprise appearance would have returned for episode two if theyâ€™d been asked to wait a full week (or longer) to see it. The episodeâ€™s arrival in quick succession helped make a case that The Mandalorian has more charm than the first episode implied â€” namely because of Baby Yoda, but also because of a more exciting story and brighter set design in general.
The showâ€™s more traditional release schedule has continued to fuel the excitement around Baby Yoda. While streaming services Netflix and Amazon Prime Video typically release their original series one full season at a time, encouraging viewers to consume all of the episodes as quickly as possible. Disney+â€™s decision to release episodes weekly allows each one more time and space to drive individual conversation. And Baby Yoda has certainly given viewers plenty of moments to be charmed by, whether itâ€™s the frog heâ€™s eating in episode two or the soup heâ€™s sipping in episode four.
As Vox sister site The Verge has noted, â€œTying new content to beloved franchises, then doling it out a bit at a time is a way for Disney, in particular, to keep subscribers hooked.â€ Making sure viewers have continued to learn more about Baby Yoda in episodes two, three, and four has helped to assuage any early fears that The Mandalorian would be all style with little substance, or that Baby Yoda himself would be a cash grab trotted out by the show to sell merchandise. Now, many viewers are in love with the lilâ€™ cutie. And for Star Wars fans who want to know every inch of the franchiseâ€™s expansive canon, the mystery of what Baby Yoda will teach us about the Yoda species is alluring.
With each passing episode, those fans will have to subsist on the latest Baby Yoda developments until the next episode arrives. And theyâ€™ll have to stay on Disney+ to do so, to make sure that Baby Yoda is A-OK.
Because if something ever happens to him, Disney, yâ€™all will have thousands of Baby Yoda Stans knocking on your door with pitchforks."
"The rapper T.I. sparked nationwide controversy last month when he said he takes his 18-year-old daughter to the doctor every year to check if she is a virgin. While he later said his comments had been misinterpreted, experts say â€œvirginity testingâ€ is a real thing that happens in the US. Now, one state is taking steps to ban it.
On a November episode of the Ladies Like Us podcast, T.I. described taking his daughter to a gynecologist after her birthday party to â€œcheck her hymen.â€ (A hymen is not actually a measure of whether someone has had sex since it can be broken during sports or other activities and a person can be born without one.) Examining someone to determine virginity is more than invasive; doctors say it can be painful and even constitute sexual assault if done without the patientâ€™s consent.
Thatâ€™s why New York State Assemblywoman Michaelle Solages introduced legislation last week to ban the practice. Virginity testing is â€œa form of violence against girls and women,â€ she told Vox. â€œItâ€™s used for control.â€
Solages is calling on federal legislators to enact a similar ban: â€œWe need to send a message to the world saying that this practice of virginity exams is unnecessary and that it should be deemed unacceptable.â€
But some say that banning the practice isnâ€™t the way to fix the problem. A ban could simply drive â€œvirginity testingâ€ underground, Dr. Ranit Mishori, a professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine and a senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights, told Vox. While she agrees doctors should not perform such exams, she says a request is a chance to talk to patients about the many issues surrounding â€œvirginityâ€ and concerns around it.
â€œRather than look at this as an issue where punitive action is required, I see this as an opportunity to open a conversation to address stigma, to address safety, to address science,â€ Mishori said.
Doctors around the country are being asked to test virginity. Itâ€™s not possible.
The issue of virginity testing started making headlines around the country after T.I. said on Ladies Like Us that he and his daughter, who is in college, â€œhave yearly trips to the gynecologist to check her hymen.â€
â€œUsually like the day after the party, sheâ€™s enjoying her gifts, I put a sticky note on the door: â€˜Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30,â€ the rapper continued, adding that, â€œas of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.â€
The response was swift, including from experts who pointed out that a doctor canâ€™t actually determine if someone has been sexually active by examining the personâ€™s hymen.
Hymens come in different shapes and sizes naturally, and can be broken by activities other than intercourse, Mishori said. Thereâ€™s no medical evidence that examining the hymen tells a doctor anything about sexual history.
There are other methods of so-called â€œvirginity testing,â€ including the â€œtwo-finger test,â€ in which a doctor inserts two fingers into the vagina to see how pliable it is, Mishori said. But this also has no basis in science.
In fact, there is no physical examination that can determine whether a person has ever had sex, Mishori said. And the entire concept of â€œvirginity testingâ€ is flawed because it doesnâ€™t take into account the many kinds of sexual activity people can engage in. â€œYou can have sex and itâ€™s not just about an insertion of a penis into a vagina,â€ Mishori pointed out.
After his initial comments caused controversy, T.I. walked them back to some degree. In an interview later in November with Jada Pinkett Smith, the rapper said he â€œbegan to embellish and exaggerateâ€ when talking about taking his daughter to the gynecologist and that listeners took his comments too literally. He also apologized to his daughter for discussing the subject publicly.
But beyond one familyâ€™s particular case, there is evidence that people around the country are asking doctors to test virginity. In a 2016 survey of OB-GYNs in the United States, about 10 percent of respondents said they had been asked to perform virginity testing, and 3.5 percent said they had done so.
Sometimes, requests for such testing come from parents, Mishori said. But sometimes they come from patients themselves, who may ask a doctor to â€œwrite a noteâ€ or otherwise provide proof that they are virgins.
Some types of virginity tests, like the two-finger test, can be painful, Mishori explained. And if a doctor performs the test without a patientâ€™s consent â€” for example, because a parent or partner asks for it â€” that â€œcould be a sexual assault and a violation of human rights,â€ she said.
If performed on survivors of sexual assault, the tests can be especially traumatic, the World Health Organization said in a statement last year. â€œGiven that these procedures are unnecessary and potentially harmful, it is unethical for doctors or other health providers to undertake them,â€ the organization stated. â€œSuch procedures must never be carried out.â€
A proposed ban on the practice has some experts concerned
Solages, a member of the New York State Assembly since 2012 who has made gender equality a focus of her work, agrees with the WHO. When she heard T.I.â€™s comments, â€œI was completely appalled,â€ she said. â€œWhether he was sarcastic or serious, he endorsed the practice of hymen examination, and he kind of made it a kitchen table conversation.â€
In response, she introduced a bill in New York State that would ban the practice. Under the measure, doctors who perform it could lose their medical licenses and, if itâ€™s performed outside a medical setting, it would be considered sexual assault and prosecuted as a felony.
The bill already has bipartisan support and Solages is optimistic it will pass. â€œWeâ€™re just trying to send the message that young girls and women are not property, that theyâ€™re human beings,â€ she said.
She also called on federal lawmakers to ban the practice, in part as a way to set an example for other countries.
However, medical professionals have voiced concerns about banning the practice, arguing that it could essentially legitimize something that is a medical impossibility, according to the New York Times. â€œYou canâ€™t tell if someone is a virgin, so how can you ban something that is not possible?â€ Dr. Maura Quinlan, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University, told the paper.
Moreover, â€œcriminalizing something doesnâ€™t mean that itâ€™s going to go away,â€ Mishori told Vox. While she agrees that doctors should not perform virginity testing, she said a legal ban could cause families to go to people who are not medical doctors for such examinations, leading to potentially more painful and harmful procedures.
If someone does request such testing, she said, itâ€™s an opportunity for a larger conversation between the doctor and the patient, perhaps involving family members as well. The doctor can explain that virginity cannot be medically tested, and can also ask questions to make sure that the patient is safe from abuse or coercion, Mishori said. For example, â€œWhat happens if the person is not going to undergo this requested test?â€ And if the person has had sex, â€œWhat would happen to them if this were to be disclosed?â€
For a doctor, a request for a virginity test is a chance to â€œtry to elevate the discussion into something thatâ€™s a little more evidence-based,â€ she said.
Despite the difference of opinion around legislation, though, many agree that more public attention paid to the concept of virginity testing is a good thing. â€œWe need to make sure that we pull this topic out of the shadows,â€ Solages said.
As for T.I.â€™s role, Solages noted that while he may have walked his comments back, heâ€™s never come out and said virginity testing is wrong. â€œI invite T.I. to come to Albany and help me pass this legislation,â€ she said."
"The 2020 presidential primary campaign field has started to winnow down, but there are still new candidates jumping into the race four months to go until the first states vote.
Any Democrat with dreams of occupying the Oval Office can see Donald Trump is a vulnerable president who hasnâ€™t broadened his appeal beyond his base. A lot of them are running for their partyâ€™s nomination next year to be its standard-bearer in the 2020 election.
There is a clear top tier of four candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden â€” the early, if unimposing, frontrunner; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has steadily risen to the top of the field; Sen. Bernie Sanders with his solid base of left voters; and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been trending upward lately.
After an early boomlet, Sens. Kamala Harris sank in the polls and became in early December the first once-major contender to drop out. Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have also been in the fray for months. A fair number of candidates have left the race: former US Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, among others.
But the field isnâ€™t quite set yet. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed for the Alabama primary right before the deadline. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick has entered the race. Even Hillary Clinton is taking calls encouraging her to run again, though she says it is exceedingly unlikely sheâ€™d seek the White House for a third time.
The Democratic field includes a record number of women and nonwhite candidates, a mix of high-wattage stars and lesser-known contenders who believe they can navigate a fractured field to victory. The debates started in June, with most candidates getting a chance to appear on stage, but the number of participants started to winnow in the third debate in September. The next Democratic debate will be held on December 19.
Whoever emerges from the Democratic primary will face Trump, who along with the Republican National Committee has already raised more than $300 million for reelection to a second term. Recent history tells us Americans usually give their presidents another four years. That should lend Trump an advantage. But the president has been historically unpopular during his first term, and heâ€™s now mired in an impeachment inquiry after an explosive scandal in which he asked the Ukrainian president for political dirt on Biden. Impeachment polling doesnâ€™t look great for Trump.
The last few months have demonstrated really anything can happen. Itâ€™s silly to pretend anybody knows how this campaign is going to end, and the 2016 election should have humbled all political prognosticators. Still, the 2020 campaign has already started. Here is what you need to know to get oriented.
Who is running for president in the 2020 election?
On the Republican side, there is of course President Donald Trump.
A few Republican officials â€” former Ohio Gov. John Kasich and popular Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan â€” have hinted they might challenge the president in a primary. But any primary challenger would be a huge underdog against the sitting president. Republican leaders have said they want to protect Trump by potentially having state parties change the rules for their primaries to guard against an insurgency.
The GOPers trying to supplant him are former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, a libertarian-leaning Republican who has officially entered the race former radio host and former Rep. Joe Walsh, who has apologized for saying racist things on Twitter. Former Rep. Mark Sanford, an ideological conservative who was a member of the Freedom Caucus while he was in the House, briefly pursued a primary challenge, but he has already dropped out. No other Republican is going to topple Trump, we can safely say.
On the Democratic side, the field is mostly set after these unexpected late entries, and candidates have started to drop out. The contenders, in rough order of standing, are:
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Biden thought hard about running in 2016, but he decided against it, being so soon after his son Beauâ€™s death and with the party establishment uniformly behind Hillary Clinton. Heâ€™s still very popular with Democratic voters, and the former veep apparently wasnâ€™t sure any of the other potential candidates would beat Trump. Though surely inflated by name recognition, Biden had a sizable early lead in the early Democratic national polls. However, Warren briefly (and very narrowly) surpassed him.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA): The Massachusetts senator is proudly progressive, though she tends to position herself as wanting to fix capitalism rather than replace it. She wants to outflank Trump on trade and give workers seats on corporate boards and tax extreme wealth. Warren got on the ground early in Iowa and other early states, and like Sanders, is not seeking money from high-dollar donors. (You might have also heard about her releasing a DNA test in an attempt to prove she had Native American roots â€” a poorly executed early attempt to rebut Trumpâ€™s â€œPocahontasâ€ taunts.)
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT): The 2016 runner-up is running again. He has the biggest grassroots base of any potential candidate, and he has been the leader of the push to move the party leftward. A more competitive field has presented Sanders with a very different race this time. And Sanders recently had a heart attack while on the campaign trail; while heâ€™s recovering, he has openly said he wonâ€™t be able to get back to the breakneck speed of events he once had. Still, for many of the Democratic left, Sanders is the only candidate with the credibility to pursue their top-tier issues, like Medicare-for-all.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Something of a viral political star, though he leads a city of â€œjustâ€ 100,000 people, Buttigieg is a military veteran and a Rhodes scholar, and he would be the first openly LGBTQ president in American history. Redevelopment and infrastructure projects have been staples of his tenure as mayor, but heâ€™s also gotten plenty of questions of how he handled racial issues in South Bend.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): The former Newark, New Jersey, mayor and part-time firefighter is another fresh face with big ideas like savings accounts for newborns, and heâ€™s also running in a Democratic primary with a lot of black voters. Heâ€™ll have to contend, though, with his work promoting charter schools (not a favorite of the teachers unions), the perception that heâ€™s close with Wall Street, and the fact he canâ€™t seem to break out of low single digits in the polls.
Andrew Yang: A humanitarian-mind entrepreneur who also served in the Obama administration. Heâ€™s running on a policy platform that includes, among other things, a universal basic income that would pay out $1,000 a month to every American over age 18.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN): She will look to blend her folksy, Midwestern manner with some crossover appeal, given her history of working across the aisle with Republicans and winning elections handily in a purplish state. Klobuchar is also known for her willingness to crack down on big tech firms focused on privacy and antitrust issues. She is struggling with a lack of name recognition, however, and she has been the subject of several reports about her alleged harsh treatment of staff.
Former San Antonio mayor and HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro: Castro got VP buzz in prior elections; now heâ€™s running in his own right after serving in Barack Obamaâ€™s Cabinet, on an aspirational message as the grandson of immigrants.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI): Gabbard fires up a certain strain of antiwar progressive. Sheâ€™s faced tough questions, though, about her apparent friendliness with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and her past comments on LGBTQ rights.
Tom Steyer: The billionaire Democratic donor has decided to enter the arena himself. He first rose to political prominence for his focus on combatting climate change and lately he has been on a crusade to convince congressional Democrats to impeach Trump. Steyer is positioning himself as a (well-funded) outsider running against a host of lifelong politicians.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg: Bloomberg had toyed with a Democratic presidential run, even though he governed the countryâ€™s biggest city as an independent, for a while now. Late in the game, he seems to have decided to finally take a shot, filing for the primary in Alabama ahead of the deadline there. He has a few policy wins that he can tout to Democratic voters, mostly notable on guns, but a centrist billionaire with some policy ideas that are anathema to the progressive base has not been a successful model in 2020 so far.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick: Patrick had sworn off a presidential bid months ago, but heâ€™s reversed course and jumped into the campaign. The ex-governor is a longtime friend and ally of Barack Obama, and heâ€™s trying to position himself as a candidate who can maintain unity within the party and country while still trying to tackle the big problems that have given the more left candidates such lift in the campaign. Whether heâ€™ll succeed is another story: Cory Booker has a similar profile and hasnâ€™t caught on so far, Democratic voters said they were already happy with the candidates they had before Patrick joined in, and he arguably lacks a signature progressive policy achievement despite eight years governing a liberal state with a Democratic legislature.
Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): Bennet is a well-regarded but nationally little-known senator. He tacks toward the center ideologically. The passion that fuels his candidacy is a fervent frustration with the way Washington works now. Bennet believes Americans are not nearly as divided as the parties in Washington and is positioning himself accordingly.
Former Rep. John Delaney: The most notable thing about Delaney is heâ€™s been running for president for over two years, more or less living in Iowa, the first state on the presidential calendar. He was the first choice of just 1 percent of Iowa Democrats in a December 2018 poll.
Marianne Williamson: A self-proclaimed â€œbitch for Godâ€ who has been a spiritual adviser to Oprah. Her previous political experience is a failed run for Congress as an independent in 2014.
Who has dropped out of the 2020 presidential campaign?
Quite a few Democrats have already given up the ghost.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): The former California attorney general started generating White House hype almost as soon as she got to the Senate in 2017. As a younger black woman, she personified the Democratic Partyâ€™s changing nature. She had endorsed Medicare-for-all and proposed a major middle-class tax credit, though her days as a prosecutor presented problems with the progressive grassroots. Harris made a big splash in early polls, but she dropped after stumbles over health care and never recovered.
Former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke: The former Texas Congress member was once 2020â€™s biggest wild card. Oâ€™Rourke built a historically successful fundraising apparatus during his losing 2018 Senate run against Ted Cruz. Heâ€™s young, and he gives a good speech. Obamaâ€™s old hands seem to like him. The open question was whether his self-evidenced political talents were matched by policy substance.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio: De Blasio, mayor of Americaâ€™s biggest city and already the unlikely victor of a contentious Democratic primary to get there, touted his progressive achievements in the Big Apple as a model for the nation: enacting universal pre-K, ending stop-and-frisk, and an ambitious local health care program.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY): Gillibrand had evolved over the years from a centrist Democrat in the House to a progressive. She endorsed Medicare-for-all and universal paid family leave; a pillar of her Senate career has been cracking down on sexual assault in the military. Gillibrand was presenting herself as a young mom in tune with the #MeToo era and the Democratic women who powered the party to historic wins in the 2018 midterms.
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper: Hickenlooper is a moderate ex-governor who pitched his ability to work across the aisle. On the issues, he touted his record on gun violence, environmental regulations, and expanding Medicaid. He conveyed an everyman persona, having founded a Denver brewery before he ever ran for public office. He decided to run for the Democratic nomination to challenge GOP Sen. Cory Gardner in 2020 instead.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee: Inslee centered his work on environmental issues and the threat of climate change. He has pushed a bill to get his home state off coal energy and all other carbon-producing energy sources by 2045. It hasnâ€™t always been smooth â€” voters in Washington rejected an Inslee-supported carbon fee in 2015 â€” but the governor hoped to quickly build a profile by focusing relentlessly on the dire threat to humanity. He has opted instead to seek a third term as governor.
Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA): Another Pelosi skeptic who helped lead the unsuccessful rebellion to stop her from becoming House Speaker again in 2016. Moulton, who represents a district in Massachusetts and is an Iraq War veteran, positioned himself as a moderate in contrast to the socialist energy animating the left and seeking to take over his party.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH): The Ohio Congress member pitched himself as the Democratic answer for Trump Country, arguing he can connect with the blue-collar workers the party has lost in the Midwest. He cited the closure of the Lordstown GM plant in his home state as part of his motivation for running. Ryan has a history of long-shot bids: He challenged Nancy Pelosi for the House Democratic leader post in 2016.
Former Sen. Mike Gravel: The 88-year-old former senator, famed for reading the Pentagon Papers into the congressional record, ran 2020â€™s oddest campaign. Two teenagers convinced Gravel to launch a protest candidacy targeting the center-left and the forever war of mainstream American foreign policy. He endorsed Gabbard and Sanders after heâ€™d exited the race.
Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam: The mayor of a Miami suburb, it seemed safe to assume Messam had the lowest name recognition of any Democrat in the race. The son of Jamaican immigrants, heâ€™s raised wages for city workers as mayor and confronted the Republican-led state government over gun control. He recently departed the massive field.
Former Rep. Joe Sestak: The retired three-star admiral and former Pennsylvania representative in Congress was a late entry to the race, announcing his campaign three days before the first Democratic debates. Sestak pitched himself heavily on his naval experience â€” his campaign logo prominently features the moniker â€œAdm. Joeâ€ â€” and the global leadership experience he says it provides.
Who else might run for president in the 2020 election?
Well, never say never, but the field might finally be set. There were a handful of names we were still watching throughout the summer â€” former senator, secretary of state, and presidential nominee John Kerry and Georgia state senator Stacey Abrams chief among them â€” but both have since said they will not run. Hillary Clinton would shake up the race if she decided to join, but she continues to tamp down on the speculation she could run again. People are going to start voting soon. We should have all the candidates weâ€™re going to get.
When do candidates have to decide whether or not to run?
Each state has its own filing deadline for federal candidates. A couple states â€” Alabama and Arkansas â€” have already had their deadlines pass. South Dakota, on the other hand, doesnâ€™t close the door on candidates until the end of March.
More realistically, itâ€™s difficult to imagine a candidate being viable if they donâ€™t start competing, at the absolute latest, in California or Texas on Super Tuesday, March 3, when theyâ€™ll already have missed the first four primary states. Nine other states vote on Super Tuesday too. Californiaâ€™s filing deadline is December 13 and Texasâ€™s is December 9. We are in the final stretch for any other candidates to get off the sidelines and make a run.
When are the next 2020 Democratic presidential primary election debates?
The Democratic National Committee announced it would hold 12 debates, starting in June 2019 and extending into 2020.
The next Democratic debate is December 19 and will be held in Los Angeles, California. It should be a much more intimate affair than the 12-candidate extravaganza at the fourth debate in October. Candidates must secure at least 200,000 individual donors. They must also reach 4 percent in the polls in four Democratic National Committee (DNC) approved national surveys or 6 percent in two DNC approved polls from the four earliest primary and caucus states: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada.
The candidates who have met the polling and donor thresholds are:
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Billionaire and climate advocate Tom Steyer
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar
Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are also close to qualifying for the December debate, though they havenâ€™t quite yet hit the thresholds.
When are the 2020 Democratic presidential primary election and caucus nights?
The votes that matter wonâ€™t be cast for another six months. We have months of formal announcements, speeches, policy rollouts, campaign gossip, unpredictable polling, and some debates before any elections happen, when candidates start collecting the delegates theyâ€™ll need to claim the nomination.
Early momentum is always critical, especially in a big field with so many candidates trying to prove that theyâ€™re viable. With that in mind, the first two months of the primary schedule:
February 3: Iowa caucuses
February 11: New Hampshire primary
February 22: Nevada caucuses
February 29: South Carolina primary
March 3 (â€œSuper Tuesdayâ€): Alabama, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Vermont primaries
March 7: Louisiana primary
March 10: Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio primaries; North Dakota caucuses
March 17: Arizona, Florida, Illinois primaries
There are at least three more months of primaries and caucuses after that. But the candidates will focus their attention and organizing on the earlier states, and we should know a lot more about the field and the strongest candidates once the first sprint is over.
How do you win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination?
The short version is you have to win a majority of the delegates.
Every state has different rules for its primary elections or caucuses in terms of allocating delegates. Candidates win delegates proportional to where they finish in the results, though they generally have to hit a minimum threshold of 15 percent to be awarded any delegates.
In terms of numbers, there will be an estimated 3,768 delegates for the 2020 Democratic National Convention (where the nominee will be formally selected) up for grabs during the primary elections. One candidate needs to win at least 1,885 delegates to be nominated.
You might hear talk of a â€œbrokeredâ€ or â€œcontestedâ€ convention if no candidate gets the necessary delegates to win on the first ballot. But that hasnâ€™t happened for decades, and itâ€™s way too early to think that will happen in 2020. That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not a possibility, but letâ€™s wait for some votes to come in before we start up that parlor game.
Democrats have made one major change from the 2016 primary on â€œsuperdelegatesâ€ â€” elected officials, party leaders, and other prominent Democrats who have votes in addition to the regular delegates awarded by state elections. In the past, superdelegates didnâ€™t have to follow any rules and could back whichever candidate they desire and make up their minds at any point in the process. When most of them endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, it gave her a built-in delegate advantage over Bernie Sanders, though she still won enough votes independent of the superdelegates to secure the nomination.
In a series of reforms, the DNC has stripped superdelegates of a vote on the first ballot. So unless the convention has to move to second or third votes because no candidate has a sufficient number of delegates â€” something that hasnâ€™t happened since the 1950s â€” superdelegates wonâ€™t matter in 2020. (Arguably, they never did. Many pointed out it was unlikely for superdelegates to use their power to overturn the outcome of the primary system, but it nevertheless created consternation within the party.)
Okay. So who will be the next president?
Ha! You almost got me."
"The Ring video doorbell is Amazonâ€™s latest infiltration into Americansâ€™ everyday lives, and even though it offers customers convenience and a sense of security, itâ€™s also attracting scrutiny.
Amazon already dominates how we shop for goods online; its Web Services arm is the backbone of numerous internet companies; and its Prime Video and Music services are angling to become primary ways that we watch and listen to media. As its influence has expanded, Amazon has become a political and social flashpoint, facing accusations from politicians, activists, and its own sellers that it relies on monopolistic e-commerce practices, that it mistreats its workers, that it doesnâ€™t pay enough in taxes, and that its relationship with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Palantir facilitates human rights abuses at the USâ€™s southern border.
Now the companyâ€™s Ring cameras are stoking fears that the e-commerce giant is further encroaching on peopleâ€™s privacy as Ring turns neighborhoods into surveillance operations and profits from the false perception that crime is on the rise. The companyâ€™s social media app, where users can share the surveillance their devices record, has been shown to exacerbate racial stereotypes and profiling. Critics view Ringâ€™s growing partnerships with local police departments as self-serving and a way for a private company to use the public sector and taxpayer money to promote its own interests.
What exactly is Ring, anyway?
Ring is a smart security device company. Itâ€™s best known for its video doorbell, which allows Ring users to see, talk to, and record people who come to their doorsteps. Acquired by Amazon for $839 million last year, the company sells wifi-enabled products that integrate with its social media app called Neighbors, where users can post videos of suspicious activity and crimes outside their front doors, as well as view posts from other people within a 5-mile radius.
Ringâ€™s low-cost security devices are part of the fastest-growing segment of smart devices, with shipments expected to grow about 21 percent every year through 2023, according to the market research firm IDC. Ring says it has â€œmillions of usersâ€ worldwide but wouldnâ€™t provide a specific number. The devices are meant to deter theft, which, conveniently, also protects Amazonâ€™s e-commerce business from losses on stolen packages.
For full access to Ringâ€™s capabilities, on top of device costs users pay a subscription fee that ranges from $30 (video saving and sharing) to $100 (professional monitoring) annually.
What does its social media app Neighbors do?
If you install a Ring device, youâ€™re automatically enrolled in its Neighbors social media app. People without Ring devices can also use the app, where they can anonymously read or post â€” using video or not â€” about crime, safety, suspicious activity, and lost pets within 5 miles of their home. The app also alerts users to real-time 911 call data as well as content from its own news team.
Posts largely discuss â€œsuspiciousâ€ people and stolen Amazon packages, and people often post video footage alongside commentary. Trained moderators attempt to remove racist posts, but plenty of examples of racial profiling persist on the app. A Vice review of Ring user posts around its Brooklyn headquarters found that the majority of those reported as â€œsuspiciousâ€ were people of color.
Neighbors is one of several increasingly popular fear-based social media apps, whose focus on crime gives people the mistaken perception that crime is increasing despite actual crime being at its lowest rate in decades.
How Ringâ€™s police partnerships work
As of the beginning of December, Ring has partnered with 677 police departments in the US (up from 400 in August) and itâ€™s continuing to expand. Partnerships give police a direct portal through which they can request video from Ring users in the event of an active nearby crime investigation. Ring users are not required to give video to police and their identities are kept secret, but Amazon has been coaching police on how to more successfully get video from Ring users without a warrant, according to Vice. CNET reported that for more than a year, ending in July, Ringâ€™s police partners had access to a map that could be zoomed in to street level of where Ring devices were installed, giving them a general idea of who might have a Ring, if not exact addresses.
Ring users who are victims of a crime, of course, may choose to share video with police of their own accord.
These partnerships also give police departments discounts on Ring products, which they can extend to their communities. While on the surface, that could seem like a plus for citizens, it raises issues of competitive fairness and what role private companies should play in the public justice system.
CNET learned that Ring has worked with police to try to automatically activate nearby Ring video cameras in the event of a 911 call, so that cops would be able to use the footage in ensuing investigations, with user permission. The project isnâ€™t currently being pursued. Gizmodo reported that what police departments disclose about their partnership with Ring is written or approved by Ring. Vice reported that partnerships require police departments to fill Ring-defined positions like a â€œPartnership Point of Contactâ€ and â€œCommunity Relations Coordinator.â€
Ring told us it doesnâ€™t have any job requirements but that it requests people already in those positions to attend trainings. Critics note that all this effectively turns the police into the marketing arm of one of the most valuable companies in the world. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation recently put it, â€œThis arrangement makes salespeople out of what should be impartial and trusted protectors of our civic society.â€
Where facial recognition fits in
Ring has long told reporters that it doesnâ€™t use facial recognition, but it has left open the possibility that itâ€™s working on that technology for future implementation. The company has filed patents to that effect. And reporting from BuzzFeed News found that Ringâ€™s Ukraine arm has been working on facial recognition technology and that it employs a â€œhead of face recognition research.â€ The Intercept reported in November that Ring planned neighborhood â€œwatch listsâ€ that use facial recognition to alert Ring users when someone considered â€œsuspiciousâ€ came into a Ring deviceâ€™s view. Earlier in November, Amazonâ€™s vice president of public policy Brian Huseman told Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) that facial recognition capabilities in Ring devices were a â€œcontemplated but unreleased feature.â€
Ringâ€™s competitor Nest, which is owned by Google, already uses facial recognition in some of its cameras.
Besides being just creepy, facial recognition technology has also proven faulty, especially when it comes to identifying nonwhite people. Research from MIT and the University of Toronto has shown that Amazonâ€™s facial recognition technology frequently mistakes dark-skinned women for men, among other issues.
Amazon has also developed it own facial recognition tech, called Rekognition, which the company sells to law enforcement agencies â€” leading some activists to speculate that the tech may be introduced into Ring surveillance cameras. Ring told Recode that it doesnâ€™t use Rekognition in its Ring products but declined to comment on whether it would do so in the future.
As Slateâ€™s April Glaser pointed out, Amazonâ€™s Rekognition proved too complicated a tool for strapped police departments with outdated computers to use. Distributing that workload â€” surveillance for now, but potentially facial recognition in the future â€” among consumers with Ring doorbells, however, seems to be a much more viable action.
For good or bad, Amazon is squarely in the publicâ€™s spotlight these days. While many people adore the convenience Amazon and its products offer, more and more theyâ€™re questioning the cost."
"Another whale has washed ashore with a stunning quantity of plastic waste in its belly.
A juvenile male sperm whale was found on Luskentyre beach in northwest Scotland over the weekend filled with 220 pounds worth of plastic bags, tubing, gloves, bundles of rope, netting, tubing, and cups.
The Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme described it on Facebook as â€œbriefly alarming (it sort of exploded) and shameful (there was a load of marine debris in its stomach).â€
The SMASS said it couldnâ€™t be certain that plastic killed the whale or caused its stranding. â€œThis amount of plastic in the stomach is nonetheless horrific, must have compromised digestion, and serves to demonstrate, yet again, the hazards that marine litter and lost or discarded fishing gear can cause to marine life,â€ it wrote in the post.
Some of the plastic waste removed from a young sperm whale found on a beach in Scotland. Scottish Marine Animal Strandings Scheme/Facebook
But the message is unmistakable: Our oceans are filling with plastic, which in turn is filling up the bellies of the creatures in the sea.
A recent study confirmed that even remote Arctic regions are not immune to our plastic garbage. Researchers examined seven beluga whales harvested by Inuvialuit hunters in Canada. This month they reported that theyâ€™d found microplastics in the digestive systems of every whale.
â€œOur observation that ... microplastics were present in every individual beluga we sampled underscores the global nature of this emerging pollutant, and the vulnerability of remote regions to contamination,â€ researchers wrote in a paper published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin.
These findings come atop all the other whales weâ€™ve seen wash ashore with huge chunks of plastic inside them this year alone.
Earlier this month, a 22 foot-long sperm whale washed ashore in Wales. Examiners found plastic sheeting in its stomach.
In May, the carcass of the young sperm whale, estimated to have been 7 years old, was found on a beach in CefalÃ¹, Italy with a stomach full of plastic. Investigators arenâ€™t certain whether the plastic killed the whale. But itâ€™s part of a gruesome pattern thatâ€™s become impossible to ignore.
In April, a pregnant sperm whale washed up on a beach in Sardinia with nearly 50 poundsâ€™ worth of plastic bags, containers, and tubing in her stomach. Biologists in Florida euthanized a baby rough-toothed dolphin with two plastic bags and a shredded balloon in its stomach.
â€œThe dolphin was very young and emaciated,â€ said Michelle Kerr, a spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, in an email. â€œDue to a poor prognosis, the decision was made to humanely euthanize the animal on scene.â€
In March, a 1,100-pound Cuvierâ€™s beaked whale was recovered in the Philippines filled with 88 pounds of plastic bags, fishing line, and rice sacks. A beached sperm whale was found in Indonesia last year with more than 1,000 pieces of plastic inside.
As the quantity of plastic humans dump in the ocean has reached obscene proportions, weâ€™re seeing more and more sea life â€” including birds, otters, sea turtles, and fish â€” choking on it.
But the impact on whales is particularly alarming. After centuries of whaling and overfishing, the survival of many whale species is already precarious. Now, just as their numbers are starting to recover, whales are consuming our toxic waste. And their deaths arenâ€™t just about biodiversity loss: Whales play a critical role in marine ecosystems, which provide 3 billion people with their primary sources of protein.
To find out more about why whales are so vulnerable to plastic waste, I talked to Lars Bejder, director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the University of Hawaii Manoa. He said there are multiple mechanisms at work here and that dying isnâ€™t the only plastic hazard for whales, and explained why the problem will only get worse.
Thereâ€™s a gargantuan amount of plastic in the ocean
The root cause of these stranded, plastic-filled whales is that plastic is cheap and easy to produce but almost impossible for nature to destroy. Chunks of plastic linger for decades, breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces. This waste then churns in the ocean in massive gyres.
Roughly 8 million metric tons of plastic â€” a mass greater than that of the Great Pyramid of Giza â€” enters the ocean each year.
Meanwhile, weâ€™re still trying to figure out how much plastic waste has already accumulated in the ocean. A study published in July in the journal Scientific Reports estimated that 414 million bits of garbage weighing 238 tons have been deposited on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands 1,300 miles off the coast of Australia. Itâ€™s a sign that even the most remote regions of the world are now contaminated with the detritus of civilization.

â€œSadly, the situation on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is not unique, with significant quantities of debris documented on islands and coastal areas from the Arctic to the Antarctic,â€ researchers wrote. â€œ[G]lobal debris surveys, the majority of which are focused solely on surface debris, have drastically underestimated the scale of debris accumulation.â€
And the amount of plastic waste in the ocean is surging. Our current trajectory puts us on track to have more plastic in the ocean than fish by weight by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum.
So for the largest, hungriest animals in the ocean, plastic is becoming an unwelcome part of their diets.
Different whales face different risks from plastic
Whales are among the more intelligent creatures in the ocean, so why arenâ€™t they smart enough to avoid eating plastic?
Well, one reason is that often plastic is in their food.
Small crustaceans like krill and tiny fish like anchovies often end up inadvertently consuming microplastics. Whales, the largest animals ever known to have existed, have a voracious appetite for these critters. A blue whale eats between 2 and 4 tons of krill per day.
Whales like the blue whale have baleen plates in their mouths that act as filters, trapping their small prey as well as small bits of plastic. This means they are less likely to ingest larger plastic waste items like bottles and containers, but the small plastic bits they consume quickly pile up.
Plastic pieces are eaten by tiny organisms in the ocean, which end up consumed by larger and larger animals.
â€œThese baleen whales filter hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of water per day,â€ Bejder said. â€œYou can imagine all these microplastics they encounter through this filtration process that then become bioaccumulated.â€
Microplastics are unlikely to obstruct the digestive tract of a baleen whale, but as they build up inside an animalâ€™s tissues, they can leach toxic chemicals like endocrine disruptors that make the creature sick. This problem can affect all ocean filter feeders, including manta rays and whale sharks.
That means there could be large whales dying of plastic poisoning without obvious culprits like flip-flops and food containers in their stomachs, according to Bejder.
A study published this year in Royal Society Open Science also reported that plastic pollution is more dangerous to baleen whales than oil spills. â€œParticle capture studies suggest potentially greater danger to [baleen whales] from plastic pollution than oil,â€ the authors wrote.
Toothed whales like sperm whales and dolphins normally catch bigger prey, like squid. But since they can swallow larger animals, they are vulnerable to larger chunks of plastic, like bags and nets.
Rescuers found a baby dolphin in distress in Fort Myers, Florida, last month. After the animal was euthanized, officials found two plastic bags and a piece of a balloon in its stomach. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission
â€œThey might be seeking those out because theyâ€™re thinking they might be prey,â€ Bejder said. A plastic container in murky waters could resemble a fish to a toothed whale, or a sperm whale may inadvertently swallow plastic garbage as it hunts for a meal.
Once ingested, the plastic piles up in the whaleâ€™s stomach. It can then obstruct bowels, preventing whales from digesting food and leading them to starve to death. It can also give a whale a false sense of being full, leading the whale to eat less and get weaker. That leaves it vulnerable to predators and disease.
Weâ€™re only seeing a tiny fraction of the whales being harmed by plastic
Part of the reason we pay so much attention to whales killed by plastic is because the whales themselves are very big and the plastic culprits are startlingly obvious. Large animals decay slowly, giving people plenty of time to figure out the cause of death, whereas smaller fish and crustaceans dying from plastic decompose quickly and are rarely investigated. Even for casual observers, a dead whale blocking a beach vacation photo is pretty hard to ignore.
Still, weâ€™re missing a big part of the picture.
â€œThe ones that land on the beach that are killed through ingestion, theyâ€™re just the tip of the iceberg. Theyâ€™re just the ones that we see,â€ Bejder said. â€œIâ€™m sure that many, many marine mammals have some levels of plastic bags and plastic items in their stomachs.â€
Many more whales could be dying from plastic poisoning without our knowledge. Around the Gulf of Mexico for example, 2 to 6 percent of whale carcasses end up on a shoreline. That means the vast majority sink to the ocean floor. This is likely the case for most of the worldâ€™s waters.
And the fact that whales are suffering shows that our marine ecosystems in general are in peril. â€œWhales, baleen whales, these larger dolphins species are pretty much at the top of the food chain,â€ Bejder said. â€œThey are sentinels of ocean health for sure.â€
But with more plastic waste pouring into the ocean, the prognosis for the most mega of megafauna is grim."
"Happy Giving Tuesday! Giving to charity is great, not just for the recipients but for the givers, too.
But it can be intimidating to know how to pick the best charity, especially when there are thousands of worthy causes to choose from. Here are a few simple tips that can help.
1) Check in with charity recommenders
It's of course possible to research charity options yourself, but it's probably better to outsource that labor to a careful, methodologically rigorous charity recommender like GiveWell. (Charity Navigator and Guidestar can be useful resources too, but they donâ€™t try to rank charities or assess which do the most good for the lowest cost.)
Related
Giving Tuesday, explained
GiveWell currently lists eight top charities, listed in order of their funding needs. If you can only support one, they advise that you support the Malaria Consortium, which â€œcan use funding most effectively in the near term.â€
Malaria Consortium, which helps distribute preventative antimalarial medication to children (a program known as â€œseasonal malaria chemopreventionâ€).
Against Malaria Foundation, which buys and distributes insecticidal bed nets, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa but also in Papua New Guinea.
Helen Keller International, which provides technical assistance to, advocates for, and funds vitamin A supplementation programs in sub-Saharan Africa, which reduce child mortality.
Evidence Actionâ€™s Deworm the World Initiative, END Fund, and Sightsavers, which all work on deworming programs to prevent parasitic infections.
GiveDirectly, which directly distributes donations to poor people in Kenya and Uganda, to spend as they see fit.
Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), which also does deworming work, but which GiveWell recommends refraining from donating to until they give more information on their near-term funding needs.
GiveWell chose those charities based on how much good additional donations would do, not necessarily how good the groups are overall; in other words, these are organizations that can put new funding to use, rather than sitting on it.
GiveWell takes that factor seriously. In 2013, it revoked its recommendation of Against Malaria on the grounds that the charity had not spent enough of the money it already raised. In 2014, GiveWell judged that Against Malaria once again had room for more funding, and restored it on the recommendation list. So you can expect Against Malaria, and the other recommended charities, to spend anything you donate effectively and reasonably promptly.
The group also takes disconfirming research seriously. In 2017, it recommended Evidence Actionâ€™s No Lean Season, which offers no-interest loans to farmers in Bangladesh during the â€œlean seasonâ€ between planting rice and harvesting it; the loans are conditional on a family member temporarily moving to a city or other area for short-term work. But a subsequent randomized evaluation found that the program didnâ€™t actually spur people to migrate or increase their incomes, and GiveWell and Evidence Action then agreed that it should no longer be a top charity; Evidence Action stopped soliciting funds for it and later shut it down.
GiveWell recommends that, if you want to maximize your giving, you give through GiveWell to dispense the money at its discretion; GiveWell gets regular information on which highly effective charities need more money and which ones don't, and can direct donations more efficiently than an individual donor. But if youâ€™re not comfortable giving through GiveWell, giving directly to any of the eight is fantastic.
2) Pick charities with research-based strategies
GiveWell's recommendations rely heavily on both evaluations done by charitable organizations and existing research literature on the kind of intervention the charities are trying to conduct.
For example, its recommendations of SCI, Sightsavers, the END Fund, and Deworm the World are based on research suggesting that providing children with deworming treatments could improve educational, economic, and other outcomes.
Research from the Poverty Action Lab at MIT suggests that giving away insecticidal bed nets for free â€” as the Against Malaria Foundation does â€” is vastly more effective than charging even small amounts for them.
And while cash certainly has its limits, hundreds of studies have found largely positive effects for the kind cash transfers that GiveDirectly distributes.
3) Give abroad
Women in Dedza, Malawi carry antimalarial bed nets. Against Malaria Foundation
It's really hard to adequately express how much richer developed nations like the US are than developing ones like Kenya, Uganda, and other countries targeted by GiveWell's most effective charities. We still have extreme poverty, in the living-on-$2-a-day sense, but it's comparatively pretty rare and hard to target effectively. The poorest Americans also have access to health care and education systems that are far superior to those of developing countries. Giving to charities domestically is admirable, of course, but if you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of saving lives, reducing illness, or improving overall well-being, you're going to want to give abroad.
Years ago, GiveWell actually looked into a number of US charities, like the Nurse-Family Partnership program for infants, the KIPP chain of charter schools, and the HOPE job-training program. It found that all were highly effective but were far more cost-intensive than the best foreign charities. KIPP and the Nurse-Family Partnership cost more than $10,000 per child served, while deworming programs like SCI's and Deworm the World's generally cost between $0.25 and $1 per child treated.
Alternatively, you could consider giving to non-humans. Animal charities, particularly those engaged in corporate pressure campaigns to better the treatment of farm animals, chickens in particular, can be effective in improving animal welfare. The charity evaluations in this area are much younger and less methodologically rigorous than GiveWell's, but Animal Charity Evaluators has named four animal groups that may be effective causes for donations:
Animal Equality, which conducts undercover investigations against factory farms, corporate campaigns to change food industry practices, and lobbying efforts to pass animal protection laws.
The Humane League, which specializes in corporate campaigns to improve farm standards, and has achieved big victories in eliminating the culling of baby chicks and getting food service companies like Kroger and Sodexo to only use cage-free eggs, and is now pushing for better standards for chickens raised for their meat.
The Good Food Institute, which promotes plant-based and cultured meat alternatives to animal-based foods.
The Albert Schweitzer Foundation, conducts corporate campaigns in Germany and Poland and is unusual in advocating for farmed fish as well as chickens and mammals.
4) If you do give locally, you can still consider impact
For years I would advocate to friends that they donate abroad, or to animal-specific charities, since their donation was likelier to have a concrete near-term impact there than in a human-based US charity, given how much money it costs to meaningfully help a resident of a rich country.
But I usually got a lot of pushback. People want to give to their specific communities, or particular causes theyâ€™re passionate about for personal reasons (like curing a disease that killed a loved one, say). And they often want to use charity as a way to connect with broader trends in the news â€” by, say, donating to help provide representation for immigrant children on the US-Mexico border.
For years I didnâ€™t have much to say to that, other than to add that itâ€™s of course fine to give to your community and personal causes; this guide is mostly meant to offer alternate suggestions if you donâ€™t have existing philanthropic interests and are curious for ways to help.
But a new nonprofit has given some new, useful tools to people in this camp. ImpactMatters, co-founded by social entrepreneur Elijah Goldberg and economist Dean Karlan, attempts to quantify the bang-for-the-buck provided by charities in several different sectors. But whereas GiveWell is pretty opinionated about cause areas â€” it pushes hard toward charities that save lives or dramatically improve financial well-being â€” ImpactMatters isnâ€™t.
So you can specify that your goal is, say, to provide a night of shelter for a person experiencing homelessness, and ImpactMatters will provide you with a menu of nonprofits and their cost-per-night-of-housing. Fellowship Deliverance Ministries in Georgia, for instance, is estimated to provide a night of shelter for $2 per person. You can also narrow down by where you want to give: hereâ€™s a list of San Francisco-specific charities, for instance.
ImpactMatters just launched for the 2019 giving season. And it has already sparked a bit of concern in some corners of the philanthropy world. Julia Coffman, director of the Center for Evaluation Innovation, had a thoughtful critique on Twitter, arguing that trying to quantify impact like this is â€œtoo reductionistâ€ and that â€œSince many direct service orgs also do systems change, I worry cost-effectiveness in relation to impact penalizes orgs that expend $ addressing systemic and structural factors that affect both their clientsâ€™ needs and their ability to deliver services in a cost-effective way.â€
Thatâ€™s fair â€” giving for societal change is really hard to do and even harder to evaluate. The causal inference behind ImpactMattersâ€™ estimates is also necessarily limited; they canâ€™t run whole experiments to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of every single charity, so instead they build detailed models to try to approximate an estimate of each charityâ€™s impact (hereâ€™s their methodology for emergency shelters for people experiencing homelessness, for instance).
But for a certain set of donors, ImpactMatters is a useful tool that might point them in the direction of nonprofits they hadnâ€™t known about previously, and which are doing good in their specific areas.
5) Consider meta-charities
Another option is giving to groups like GiveWell, Innovations for Poverty Action, the Life You Can Save, Giving What We Can, and 80,000 Hours that evaluate development approaches/charities and encourage effective giving. Suppose that every dollar given to Giving What We Can â€” which encourages people to pledge to donate at least 10 percent of their income until retirement â€” results in $1.20 in donations to the Against Malaria Foundation. If that's the case, then you should give to Giving What We Can until the marginal effect on donations to Against Malaria hits $1 or lower.
""If they can turn a dollar of donations into substantially more than a dollar of increased donations to effective charities, isn't that the best use of my money?"" asks Jeff Kaufman, a software developer who with his wife, the fantastic effective altruism activist and organizer Julia Wise, gives about half his income to effective charities and meta-charities.
6) Saving lives isn't everything

If you only care about reducing early mortality and giving people more years to live, then you should give all your donations to the the Malaria Consortium, Helen Keller International or the Against Malaria Foundation. Malaria is a frequently fatal disease, and cost-effective interventions to reduce malaria infection are a great way to save lives. Similarly, Vitamin A supplementation, like HKI does, is an effective way of reducing child mortality.
But the rest of the charities GiveWell recommends don't mainly focus on reducing mortality. Quality of life matters, too. Parasitic infections hamper children's development and education, which can have negative consequences lasting decades. Having increased access to cash may not extend the life of a GiveDirectly recipient, but it does make life considerably more pleasant.
7) Don't give to a big charity
You'll notice that all of the charities GiveWell recommends are reasonably small, and some big names are absent. That's not an accident. In general, charity effectiveness evaluators are skeptical of large relief organizations, for a number of reasons.
Large organizations tend to be less transparent about where their money goes and also likelier to direct money to disaster relief efforts, which are usually less cost-effective, in general, than public health programs. ""Overall, our impression is that your donation to these organizations is very hard to trace, but will likely supplement an agenda of extremely diverse programming, driven largely by governments and other very large funders,"" writes GiveWell cofounder Holden Karnofsky.
8) Maybe just give money directly to poor people
GiveDirectly uses the M-PESA system for mobile cash transfers. GiveDirectly
For years one of my primary charities was GiveDirectly, which is the only cause outside public health to get GiveWell's top rating, and, to my knowledge, the only charity devoted to unconditional cash transfers. I gave to them partly because there's a large body of research on the benefits of cash transfers, which I find quite compelling.
(I have ceased donating to them since Future Perfect started and instead give to GiveWellâ€™s top charities bucket, as a way to avoid conflicts of interest as I write more about charity. I view the GiveWell option as equivalent to investing in index funds to avoid any bias as a business reporter.)
But I donated to GiveDirectly mostly because I didnâ€™t trust myself to know what the world's poorest people need most. I've been profoundly lucky to never experience the kind of extreme poverty that billions of people worldwide have to endure. I have no idea what I would spend a cash transfer from GiveDirectly on if I were living on less than $2 a day in Uganda. Would I buy a bed net? Maybe! Or maybe I'd buy an iron roof. Or school tuition for loved ones. Or cattle.
But you know who does have a good sense of the needs of poor people in Uganda? Poor people in Uganda. They have a very good idea of what they need. Do they sometimes misjudge their spending priorities? Certainly; so do we all. And bed nets and deworming treatments appear to be underpurchased relative to the actual need for them. But generally, you should only give something other than cash if you are confident you know the recipients' needs better than they do. With the exception of bed nets â€” which really do seem underprovided when they're just put up for sale rather than given away for free â€” I'm not confident of that. So I gave cash.
As the World Bank's Jishnu Das once put it, ""'Does giving cash work well' is a well-defined question only if you are willing to say that 'well' is something that WE, the donors, want to define for families whom we have never met and whose living circumstances we have probably never spent a day, let alone a lifetime, in."" If you're not willing to say that, then you should strongly consider giving cash.
9) Give what you can (though if you can spare it, pledging to give 10 percent of your income would be fantastic)
One of the hardest problems in philanthropy is deciding how much to donate.
There are some people who argue the correct answer, unless youâ€™re near the end of your life, is nothing: you should, on this view, not give to charity during your career, and instead save as much of your money as possible and donate it when you die (my colleague Kelsey Piper explains why this is probably not a good approach).
Another approach is to â€œearn to giveâ€: take a high-paying job, typically in finance or tech, and give a huge share, like 40 to 50 percent, of your earnings away.
I wrote about people who do this back in 2013, and I know that many of the people I profiled still earn-to-give; for them, at least, this is a sustainable option. Itâ€™s a really good career option if you like working in finance and tech, but frankly itâ€™s not the best option for most people, and there are a lot of amazing jobs â€” in scientific research, in the private sector, in direct charity or nonprofit or government work â€” where the typical person can do more good than they could by using their career as a mechanism through which to generate donation money.
So I suggest a more moderate course. Iâ€™ve signed the Giving What We Can pledge, which commits members to donating 10 percent of their annual income to highly effective charities. That is a totally reasonable number, comparable to alms in many religions, that requires relatively minimal sacrifice relative to what earn-to-give people do.
Even if 10 percent is too much for you, though, donâ€™t despair. Giving $1 is better than giving $0. Perhaps the most important thing is to just get into the groove of donating, to make it a habit. I use direct deposit on my paychecks to make most of my charitable contributions, just so itâ€™s extremely automatic and hard for me to avoid doing. Going from not giving to giving a little, regularly, is a huge positive step.

"Jeremy Corbyn was never expected to be the leader of the UK Labour Party, until he was. He was never expected to last in the role, until he did. He was never expected to seriously challenge Theresa May and the Conservative Party in the 2017 election, until he did.
And he is never expected to be prime minister of the United Kingdom.
Corbyn is a left-wing member of Parliament who calls himself a socialist; whoâ€™s had decades in politics to accumulate a lengthy record; whoâ€™s been haunted by charges of anti-Semitism in his party; who was called everything from a â€œbig girlâ€™s blouseâ€ to â€œJoseph Stalinâ€ by his main political rival just this year; whoâ€™s been noncommittal about Brexit; and who recently was one of the most unpopular opposition leaders since people have been tracking these things.
So heâ€™s not someone who could ever really be prime minister, right?
And yet maybe, it could still happen.

The United Kingdom is holding general elections on December 12, in what Corbyn himself has called a â€œonce-in-a generationâ€ vote. Corbyn will lead the Labour Party against Boris Johnson, the current prime minister and head of the Conservative Party.
The political stalemate over Brexit â€” the UKâ€™s divorce from the European Union â€” finally forced lawmakers to agree to elections in October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted a vote. He lost his partyâ€™s majority in September, which derailed his plan to get Brexit done by October 31 and meant heâ€™d likely continue to struggle to pass his Brexit deal in Parliament, let alone any other legislation.
Labour lawmakers supported an election somewhat reluctantly. Corbyn is a huge reason why.
The opposition leader is stunningly unpopular. Corbynâ€™s approval rating hovers in the 20 percent range. Thatâ€™s remarkable, especially because Johnson himself is a pretty polarizing figure, yet is somehow still more popular. Combine that with a lot of polling that shows the Conservative Party comfortably ahead (though itâ€™s narrowing) in any election race, and Labourâ€™s odds never looked stellar.
Labourâ€™s somewhat muddled stance on Brexit in an election that is absolutely all about Brexit may also be a liability. Labour has said it will renegotiate a new Brexit deal with closer EU ties but will also back another referendum, giving voters the option to remain within the European Union.
Meanwhile, Johnson and the Conservatives are staking their political fortunes on the promise of delivering Brexit by January 31. Other opposition parties, most notably the Liberal Democrats, have carved out a strong position on staying in the EU.
Labourâ€™s platform is trying to please both Brexit supporters and opponents. Amid such polarization, that stance might please no one at all.
Yet Corbyn remains enormously popular with Labourâ€™s activist base, and his ascension to Labour leader has energized the party as heâ€™s moved it leftward, crowding out more centrist figures. He may be the best hope for those who want to figure out a way to stop the UK from leaving the EU â€” or those who, at the very least, arenâ€™t interested in Johnsonâ€™s brand of Brexit.
If British politics in the age of Brexit have proven anything, predictions (or even polling) are not always reliable. A Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn looks unlikely right now. But nothing is for sure until British voters go to the polls on December 12.
To understand why Corbyn is such a divisive figure, and why his party has struggled to define itself during Brexit, hereâ€™s what you need to know about the Labour leader who may never enter 10 Downing Street, but who will shape his party â€” and Britainâ€™s political future â€” no matter what.
A brief introduction to Jeremy Corbyn
Corbyn describes himself as a socialist. His politics are a throwback to an older version of Britainâ€™s Labour Party, which embraced government control of parts of the economy and big social welfare programs.
Corbyn was first elected to Parliament in 1983, representing Islington North, a reliable Labour seat in London heâ€™s now held for more than 35 years.
Corbyn came to Parliament in a year that was otherwise horrible for the Labour Party. Its 1983 election manifesto (sort of like a party platform in the US) was one the most left-wing in the partyâ€™s history to date. One Labour MP at the time famously called it the â€œlongest suicide note in historyâ€ after Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, destroyed Labour that year in one of the largest electoral victories in the postwar era.

That helped begin Labourâ€™s rightward shift to a more moderate, centrist party that is socially liberal but somewhat more fiscally conservative and free-market oriented. That transformation culminated in the election of Tony Blair as Labour leader in 1994. Under Blair, Labour took power in 1997, an era thatâ€™s sometimes referred to as â€œNew Labour.â€
But Corbyn didnâ€™t shift to the center with the rest of his party. He stayed on the margins, maintaining his ties with other veterans of old Labour and those outside of the party in leftist UK politics.
â€œHe basically spent most of his time opposing the policies of his own party,â€ Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, told me. Especially when Tony Blair was prime minister, â€œhe was in opposition to everything that was going on,â€ despite his party being in control of government.
Corbyn, then, was very much an outsider who remained on the backbenches (meaning he never held a ministerial position) for years.
Corbynâ€™s foreign policy in particular has gotten him into quite a bit of trouble, and it continues to today. He worked closely with Stop the War coalition, which was formed after 9/11 to oppose the intervention in Afghanistan. Not surprisingly, the Stop the War coalition opposed the Iraq War, as did Corbyn. Blair, of course, supported it, a position that would come back to haunt Blair and the Labour Party.
But other positions are harder for Corbyn to justify. He once called NATO a â€œdanger to world peaceâ€ and has remained skeptical of many postwar alliances â€” not unlike US President Donald Trump. Heâ€™s ambivalent about the European Union and previously voted against some of the key EU treaties.
Corbynâ€™s also been sharply critical of Israel, which has fueled allegations of anti-Semitism. In 2009, he famously called the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah â€œfriends.â€ He supported the Irish Republican Army (IRA), including during the height of the Troubles in the 1980s and 1990s. Campaigning this week in Scotland, a heckler called him a â€œterroristâ€ sympathizer.
Corbyn has a lot of political baggage, and for 30 or so years, he was kind of an obscure figure in Labour politics â€” until 2015, that is.
How Jeremy Corbyn became Labour leader â€” and why heâ€™s stayed there
Corbyn became Labour leader in 2015 in an extraordinary upset. He started as a 200-to-1 outsider when the contest began but ended up winning 60 percent of the vote from the Labour Party.
His victory was startling at the time, but in retrospect it makes some sense. The era of New Labour had lasted for more than a decade, but Labour lost its majority in 2010, and Conservatives beat them again in 2015.
The dissatisfaction with Labour during this period had a lot to do with its policies under Blair, namely support for the Iraq War. Many British voters also blamed Labour for the 2008 recession, since the party was in charge at the time of the financial market crash.

Voters, particularly younger ones, didnâ€™t love the policies of the Conservatives. The party pursued austerity â€” in other words, basically lots of spending cuts to social and public services. Other issues, like climate change, also motivated the next generation of voters.
Taken together, voters began to blame the establishment politicians of the past for these failures. Within the Labour Party, some also saw the more moderate Blairites as not all that different from the Conservative politicians.
Corbyn emerged against this backdrop as a politician in his 60s who was untainted by those establishment politics. â€œWhat you got was the oldest candidate looking like the freshest and the newest,â€ David Kogan, author of Protest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party, told me. Itâ€™s not unlike the political rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders in the US.
Corbyn went from impossible odds to looking like the favorite. This was terrifying for most politicians in the party, who saw Corbynâ€™s ascension as a huge electoral disadvantage, given his leftist politics. At the time, Blair said that with Corbyn as leader, â€œThe party wonâ€™t just face defeat but annihilation.â€
But Labourâ€™s membership also surged after Corbynâ€™s victory. The party had less than 200,000 members (people who pay dues) before the 2015 election; in 2018, that number surged to more than 500,000 members, making Labour the largest political party in the UK.
As Kogan explained, Labourâ€™s ranks swelled because Corbynâ€™s victory brought back those traditional Labour members who had fallen away during the Blair years. It also attracted a new base of young voters, many of whom came of age post-2008 recession and supported Corbynâ€™s left-wing economic policies, though they were also motivated by those other issues, like climate change.
Corbyn energized the activist base of the Labour Party. But divisions between this coalition of â€œCorbynistasâ€ and other veterans of the party, specifically lawmakers, did not disappear. In 2016, Corbyn faced a leadership challenge shortly after the June Brexit referendum. Labour lawmakers voted against him in a confidence vote, citing, among other things, his failure to do enough to promote Remain, Labourâ€™s official position in the 2016 referendum.
But Corbyn soundly defeated his challenger in that contest, achieving the partyâ€™s backing with a slightly greater margin than in 2015. It showed just how strong Corbynâ€™s support was among the party base, and how quickly he â€” and his supporters â€” had started to reshape the party.
The next test for Corbyn came in the 2017 election. Then-Prime Minister Theresa May called a vote in an attempt to shore up her Brexit mandate. She started out with a 20-point lead and looked likely to deliver another Conservative majority.
Instead, that advantage evaporated. Conservatives lost seats and their majority. Labour increased its number of seats in Parliament by 31. May managed to form a government and retain control by entering into an arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party, a conservative party in Northern Ireland. But as Brexit unfolded, that control proved to be pretty precarious.
Meanwhile, Corbyn once again defied expectations with Labourâ€™s relative success. That helped undercut some of the doubters.
But not all of them. Those divisions within Labour persist. Though the base of the party has mostly gone all-in for Corbyn, many lawmakers are still in that more moderate mold. Controversies, particularly criticism of Corbyn for his handling of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party, have publicly torn the party apart.
And, of course, thereâ€™s the Brexit debate.
Jeremy Corbynâ€™s big, huge, unavoidable Brexit problem
Corbyn has always been ambivalent about the European Union, which has made him something of an odd fit to be leader during the Brexit debate. Though he voted Remain in 2016, he hasnâ€™t exactly been a full-throated defender of the EU. And he was outright antagonistic at the start of his political career.
Corbynâ€™s left-wing critique of the EU is a minority view within the party, Eric Shaw, an honorary research fellow in politics at the University of Stirling, told me. But itâ€™s a view some of Corbynâ€™s associates, who share his ideological bent, support. â€œThe European Union embeds free market principles, embeds corporate power, and membership impedes the capacity of the British government to achieve socialism,â€ Shaw said, summing up the left-wing critique of the EU.

Theyâ€™re sometimes called â€œLexiteers,â€ essentially left-wing Brexiteers.
Corbyn voted to leave the European Economic Community, the precursor to the EU, in 1975. As a member of Parliament, he voted against the Maastricht Treaty, which helped form the current version of the EU.
â€œThe whole basis of the Maastricht Treaty is the establishment of a European central bank which is staffed by bankers, independent of national Governments and national economic policies, and whose sole policy is the maintenance of price stability,â€ Corbyn said at the time, arguing against the treaty in Parliament. â€œThat will undermine any social objective that any Labour Government in the United Kingdom â€” or any other government â€” would wish to carry out.â€
In 1996, Corbyn blasted the EU bureaucracy as â€œtotally unaccountable to anybody.â€ Corbyn also opposed the 2008 Lisbon Treaty, which also helped expand the EU.
Fast-forward to the Brexit referendum in 2016: Labour and Corbyn officially supported Remain (so did then-Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron as well as his successor, Theresa May.)
But enough members of his own party saw Corbynâ€™s campaign for Remain as lackluster at best. His fiercest critics accused him of outright sabotaging the referendum. That helped prompt that 2016 leadership challenge, which Corbyn survived.
But Corbynâ€™s Brexit problem hasnâ€™t gone away. Itâ€™s only gotten worse â€” for both him and the Labour Party.
Labourâ€™s â€œfence-sittingâ€ on Brexit is hurting its chances in the 2019 election
In March 2017, the UK Parliament overwhelmingly voted to trigger Article 50, the provision in the EUâ€™s Lisbon Treaty that gives countries the power to withdraw from the bloc. That set off a countdown to a March 2019 Brexit, which, of course, has not happened yet.
At the time, Corbyn and Labour supported triggering Article 50, though some members of his party joined the more than 100 MPs that rebelled against initiating the divorce. This vote happened before the EU and UK ever sat down for serious negotiations, so few knew what kind of Brexit deal then-Prime Minister Theresa May would bring back from Brussels. But the argument at the time was pretty simple: The UK voted to leave, 52 percent to 48 percent, so their representatives had to back the will of the people.

As mentioned above, the UK held general elections in June 2017, a few months later. May wanted to bolster her majority for Brexit negotiations. Labour backed Brexit, but campaigned for a softer version, meaning closer ties with the EU. In that election, May lost her Conservative majority and Labour did much better than expected.
But â€œbetter than expectedâ€ meant that Labour remained in the opposition, which also meant it didnâ€™t have the power to solve Brexit. Still, Labour frequently joined with the pro-Remain opposition â€” such as the Scottish National Party and some pro-Remain rebels within the Conservative Party â€” and helped spoil the Brexit plans of both May and Johnson, forcing all those extensions and blocking a no-deal Brexit.
Corbyn and the Labour Party, then, stood against whatever the Conservative government brought back. At the same time, Labour vacillated on coming up with its own clear position that wasnâ€™t simply anti-May or anti-Johnson or anti-no-deal.
Labour has some reason for this ambiguity on Brexit. Much of his party favor remaining in the European Union, and that includes a huge portion of its base in cities and even those young, grassroots activists who helped get Corbyn elected. But there are Labour seats in constituencies that voted Leave, many in traditional working-class strongholds such as in the north of England.
Though such voters make up a much smaller percentage, theyâ€™re still seen as an important part of Labourâ€™s traditional base. (Does this sound familiar, maybe?) And thatâ€™s why Labour defended its somewhat amorphous position on Brexit. Unlike Conservatives, who are more explicitly in favor of leaving the EU (though there are pro-Remain people among them), Labour had a much more complicated coalition to represent.
But in trying to please everyone, Labour risks disappointing everyone. If you want to Leave, you have the Conservative Party and the Brexit Party, both of which promise to deliver that. Johnson and the Conservatives have a clear message: Brexit by January 31. The same is true on the other side of the political spectrum. The much smaller Liberal Democrats, as well as the Greens and the Scottish National Party, also have clear messages: no Brexit.
Labour is trying to find a compromise between the two extremes. And in the polarized Brexit era, that might be the worst of all strategies.
In a recent tweet, hereâ€™s how Corbyn described Labourâ€™s position: â€œSecure a credible deal in three months. Put it to the people for the final say, with the option to remain, in six months.â€
â€œThatâ€™s our Brexit policy,â€ he concluded.
The problem with that Brexit policy: it runs into the same problem Labour has had all along: Itâ€™s not quite a commitment to Brexit, but itâ€™s also not quite a commitment to stay in the EU.
â€œItâ€™s a position that is Labour sitting on the fence,â€ Eunice Goes, a professor of politics at Richmond University in London, told me. â€œTheyâ€™re not declaring in favor of Brexit or of remainingâ€ in the EU.
If youâ€™re a voter whoâ€™s eager to stay in the European Union, Labourâ€™s policy doesnâ€™t guarantee that. And if youâ€™re a voter who really wants to Leave, Labourâ€™s policy doesnâ€™t guarantee that either.
Corbyn is selling this as, â€œWeâ€™ll give you a final say on Brexit in six months.â€ But contrast that with the coherent messages of Labourâ€™s competitors, from Johnson and the Conservative (â€œGet Brexit Doneâ€) to the Liberal Democrats (â€œStop Brexitâ€). Labourâ€™s stance is much more complicated and unclear, and it will also prolong the divorce process even more â€” taking weeks or months for negotiations, weeks or months for a referendum, and then who knows what comes after that. Itâ€™s just a lot.
There are also some logistical problems here. Renegotiating a new deal and getting those extensions also depends on the EU. After May, and after Johnson, will the EU renegotiate with a third prime minister?
Then thereâ€™s the issue of holding a second referendum with the option to Remain. If Labour holds such a referendum, will the party â€” including Corbyn â€” campaign against the brand-new deal he just renegotiated, and urge people to vote for Remain? Why would the EU go through the exercise of renegotiating a deal if the UK government is going to actively campaign against it?
And then thereâ€™s dealing with the fallout of whatever the outcome: a Brexit plan, or voting to Remain, which is likely going to enrage a huge chunk of people in a polarized country.
Itâ€™s still not really clear where Corbyn himself stands on the issue of leaving or remaining. Sure, he supports a second referendum â€” but what outcome does he want? Corbyn has repeatedly dodged this question. During his first debate with Johnson in November, he wouldnâ€™t give a straight answer other than to say a second referendum was the best option.
In a BBC Question Time session with party leaders, Corbyn, when pressed, finally said he would take a â€œneutral stanceâ€ on any referendum â€” meaning he wouldnâ€™t campaign for Leave or Remain. In other words, heâ€™ll sit on the fence regarding Brexit, right up to the end. What that might mean for his party, especially the pro-Remain lawmakers who really want to remain, is unclear.
Many experts I spoke to think Labour is taking this muddled approach for the wrong reasons. There are Labour districts that voted Leave in 2016, but Labour is still largely a Remain-leaning party. Even in 2017, research showed that most people who voted Labour â€” even in those Leave-voting districts â€” voted Remain.
Paul Webb, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex, said that based on analysis of the 2017 election, even in those Leave-voting areas, â€œThe overwhelming majority of people who voted for Labour in those seats were Remainers, and they werenâ€™t Leavers. So they might have been majority Leave seats, but Labour voters in those seats were Remainers.
â€œIn a sense, by worrying too much about these places,â€ Webb added, â€œLabour is kind of pandering to its opponents and people who werenâ€™t inclined to vote for the party anyway.â€
In other words, Labourâ€™s attempts to retain Leave voters may not be a winning electoral strategy. And even if it was, a soft Brexit/second referendum might not be the option that appeals to them, especially if Brexit is driving the vote. (And in this election, itâ€™s all about Brexit.) And Conservatives are still framing a vote for Labour as a vote to Remain, anyway.
This is where Corbynâ€™s public skepticism of Europe comes in. Corbynâ€™s biggest critics say itâ€™s his distaste for the EU thatâ€™s ultimately preventing him from taking Labour off the fence and embracing a more explicitly Reman position.
In other words, it really doesnâ€™t matter what Corbyn says or does â€” he still comes off as a secret Leave supporter. And Labourâ€™s half-baked Brexit stance hasnâ€™t dispelled that impression.
â€œHe actually wants a position going into this election that will allow him to Leave, because thatâ€™s what he really wants to do,â€ Fielding, the University of Nottingham professor, said, though he acknowledged others might disagree with him.
But, he added, thatâ€™s why Corbyn is â€œto-ing and fro-ing and why heâ€™s been so unwilling â€” on this one issue â€” to defy Labour members.â€
Brexit isnâ€™t Corbynâ€™s only problem
Brexit may be a huge problem for Labour. But if you hate Brexit, youâ€™re probably not going to cast a vote for a Conservative MP. Thereâ€™s a risk, though, that Remain-leaning parties like the Liberal Democrats and Greens could split the votes with Labour, allowing a more pro-Brexit candidate to slip through.
The bunch of Remain parties â€” including the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, and the Welsh party, Plaid Cymru â€” have pledged to only run the strongest candidate among their parties in certain districts in an effort to avoid any vote-splitting. Some polling has shown that so-called â€œtactical votingâ€ could boost Labourâ€™s electoral chances, but the party hasnâ€™t signed on. Voters may take it on themselves to vote tactically, or to bet that voting Labour is still the best option to defeat Brexit. But itâ€™s hard to say right now how that will shake out.

And Corbyn is still a problem even beyond Brexit. His political past is still a weakness; voters outside of the core of the Labour Party still see him as a radical figure who espouses extreme positions. His critics are also trying to paint him this way â€” but many of the policies Labour is promoting in its 2019 manifesto, such as more money for the National Health Service, more affordable housing, and evens some of those the nationalization plans, are pretty popular with the general public.
The anti-Semitism crisis within Labour is likely to be another problem for Corbyn. As mentioned above, Corbyn has been more critical of Israelâ€™s government than most members of his party.
But since his ascension to party leader in 2015, heâ€™s also been accused of showing â€œpoor judgmentâ€ on the issue of anti-Semitism.
Some Jewish Labour MPs came under attack from the far right, specifically Jewish women MPs who faced incredible vitriol. But there was also evidence that some Labour Party members were also spewing hateful rhetoric at lawmakers. This turned into a crisis this past spring, when nine Labour MPs left the party. The UKâ€™s Equality and Human Rights Commission launched a formal investigation into the party over those anti-Semitism allegations, a pretty dramatic step.
Corbyn is accused of not having properly condemned the attacks and of allowing this to fester within the partyâ€™s ranks. This has damaged â€œhis moral stance as a good man,â€ Kogan told me. â€œThe accusation of allowing anti-Semitism to take place and not be dealt with, and thatâ€™s affected him in his claims to be a different sort of politician.â€
The problem isnâ€™t going away, either. The Jewish Chronicle used its front page in early November to call on voters to reject Corbyn. â€œIf this man is chosen as our next prime minister, the message will be stark: that our dismay that he could ever be elevated to a prominent role in British politics, and our fears of where that will lead, are irrelevant,â€ the newspaper wrote.
The UKâ€™s chief rabbi has also questioned Corbynâ€™s fitness to be prime minister, weeks into the campaign.
And another former Labour MP, Ian Austin, who left the party over allegations of anti-Semitism earlier this year, said he refused to vote for Corbyn because of his â€œextremism.â€ He encouraged voters to select Johnson instead.
Speaking of the current prime minister, contrasting the two further highlights Corbynâ€™s unpopularity. Johnson is undoubtedly an energetic campaigner, but heâ€™s also a divisive figure who has a lot of baggage. The fact that Corbyn canâ€™t capitalize on Johnsonâ€™s weaknesses shows just how broadly heâ€™s disliked.
â€œI have no doubt that if (as we say here) he was to be run over by a London bus and replaced by the most capable of Labourâ€™s leaders, Keir Starmer, Labourâ€™s ratings would dramatically rise,â€ Shaw told me, adding that the Conservatives â€œare praying for Corbynâ€™s good health.â€
A July survey found that the public trusts Johnson â€” a guy who once got fired for lying â€” more than Corbyn. Just 21 percent of people have a positive opinion of Corbyn; 61 percent have a negative opinion, according to YouGov. In an August YouGov poll, 48 to 35 percent of voters said Corbyn becoming prime minister would be a worse outcome than a no-deal Brexit.
If youâ€™re thinking, â€œSure, but Corbyn didnâ€™t do so bad in 2017!â€ youâ€™re not wrong â€” but heâ€™s pretty much been trending downward ever since. His approval has steadily decreased, in some instances hitting truly dismal numbers. His approval rating has ticked up slightly in recent weeks to an average of just 22 percent, according to Howard Clarke, a polling expert at the University of Texas at Dallas. But 22 percent going into a general election is horrendously bad.
As Clarke told me via email, recent polls showed Johnsonâ€™s approval rating at around 49 percent â€” not great, but a heck of a lot better than 22 percent.

â€œThatâ€™s what makes this election such a complicated choice for a lot of people,â€ Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, told me. â€œYou have voters that are opposed to Brexit, but are very concerned about what a Corbyn government would mean for the countryâ€™s social and economic policies.â€
Is Labour doomed?
â€œItâ€™s not looking like a good shot,â€ Kogan told me about Labourâ€™s chances in the next election.
Johnson and the Conservatives have a strong lead in the polls. Corbyn remains unpopular. Labourâ€™s Brexit policy is still wishy washy. But with less than a month go before Britain votes, itâ€™s probably too soon to call it. Johnsonâ€™s lead could evaporate â€” and Corbyn could do better than expected once again.

Even so, itâ€™s unlikely Labour will win a majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. There have been swings in the polls for Conservatives, with some showing a dramatic lead and others showing a smaller margin of victory, but theyâ€™re still ahead in most. Most experts I talked to think Conservatives will win â€”maybe not with an overwhelming majority, but likely just enough to get Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal through.
Even if that doesnâ€™t happen, an outright Labour majority is still looking difficult to achieve. Instead, the more likely scenario is a hung Parliament, where no one party wins the majority. In this case, itâ€™s possible Labour will do well enough to form some sort of alliance with the Scottish National Party (likely for the price of another Scottish independence referendum), or to at least get the votes of some other pro-Remain parties. Basically, enough anti-Brexit voters will potentially hold their noses for Corbyn to at least try to foil Brexit.
However, experts I talked to agreed that if Labour is defeated outright, Corbyn will almost certainly lose his position as leader. Labour should clean up in these elections. Conservatives have been in charge for 10 years and even theyâ€™re promising more spending on things like the National Health Service, in an acknowledgment that the general public is fed up with the Conservativesâ€™ past austerity policies.
Boris Johnson himself is a strange figure in British politics â€” heâ€™s not all that well-liked nor deeply trusted within the Conservative Party, unable to completely shake the reputation that heâ€™s just out for himself.
If Labour canâ€™t capitalize on this, particularly in this â€œonce-in-a-generationâ€ election, it will be a strong indictment of its leader. But Corbynâ€™s influence wonâ€™t necessarily fade even when heâ€™s gone. He may fail in this election, but the leftward shift he set in motion within Labour could very well outlast him.

"Giving Tuesday is upon us â€” and not a moment too soon as we emerge from the post-Thanksgiving shopping frenzy.
Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, has always been the kickoff event of the holiday shopping season, and one of the biggest shopping days of the year. Marketing experts recognized how popular it was and followed it up with Cyber Monday, a second day of mega-sales focused on online shopping. It took off, making the period after Thanksgiving famous for its blitz of deals.
In 2012, the 92nd Street Y in New York and the United Nations Foundation introduced Giving Tuesday â€” the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving â€” with the hope that after several days of big sales and rampant consumption, thereâ€™d be interest in giving back.
They were right. #GivingTuesday went viral almost immediately.

One of the most used criteria for judging a charity is also one of the worst
At launch, #GivingTuesday was just an idea, some publicity, a social media hashtag, and a package of advice and branding for organizations anywhere that wanted to participate. The 92nd Street Y developed the hashtag, marketing advice, and resources, and released them all for any nonprofit to use. They made a point of not including any branding for the 92nd Street Y itself, in order to make the event more universal. â€œWithout the branding [for the Y], people were more likely to own it and shape it,â€ Asha Curran, CEO of Giving Tuesday, told me last year. â€œYou can cross borders with a big idea.â€
The makers of Giving Tuesday were very much in step with the moment, harnessing the power of a hashtag to spark a global conversation and a movement. This year, Giving Tuesday formally broke off from the 92nd Street Y to become an independent organization.
Since Giving Tuesdayâ€™s launch in 2012, nonprofits all over the US â€” and eventually, all over the world â€” have hosted fundraisers and events, using the branding and hashtag associated with the movement.
In its first year, itâ€™s estimated that about $10 million was donated to charity through Giving Tuesday fundraisers. The following year, it was $28 million. In 2018, some 4 million donors moved nearly $380 million. This year, that figure should be even higher.
And awareness is growing. According to a recent survey by Classy, a web fundraising firm, 37 percent of respondents said they had heard of Giving Tuesday, up 10 percent from the previous year.
The rapid growth in donors and awareness underscores the fact that Giving Tuesday has become a phenomenon in its own right â€” an outlet for a backlash against the consumerism of the holiday shopping season.
The perfect conditions to launch Giving Tuesday
Shoppers eagerly participate in the sales events of Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
But ... well, many people also hate the post-Thanksgiving shopping crush, and question what it says about us as a society. Vox has covered its grueling effects on the retail workers who make it happen. The website Black Friday Death Count documents instances of violence in retail stores during Black Friday sales. A 2016 piece in the Guardian called on us to reject the â€œseasonal consumerist circle of hell so appalling that even Dante didnâ€™t dare imagine it.â€
So the idea of a day, after the sales, to step away from buying and focus on giving struck a chord. (Besides, some researchers have posited a link between generosity and gratitude, which makes after Thanksgiving a good time to get people to think about giving.)
Giving Tuesday has been picking up steam since its first year. In 2013, its second year, it received coverage in Charity Navigator and the Chronicle of Philanthropy and a headline donation from Facebook billionaire Dustin Moskovitz to the top global poverty charity GiveDirectly. It went international too. â€œGiving Tuesday exists in countries where Black Friday and Cyber Monday donâ€™t exist,â€ Curran told me, â€œand that reminds us that thereâ€™s this value that unites us.â€
In 2017, Facebook drove some donations. It partnered with the Gates Foundation to match up to $2 million in donations through the platform, and to waive transaction fees for donating through Facebook. The $2 million in donations was claimed within two minutes.
For 2018, Facebook and Paypal offered $7 million in matching donations â€” a limit they hit in a matter of seconds.
Facebook is doing it again â€” matching up to $7 million in donations â€” for this yearâ€™s Giving Tuesday.
Does Giving Tuesday do any good?
Itâ€™s worth noting that all of this is still a relatively small share of total charitable giving. In 2018 in the United States, individuals, corporations, and private foundations gave a combined $427.7 billion to charity, $292 billion of which was from individuals.
Compared to that, the $7 million Facebook is offering in matching funds, or even the $380 million donated overall last year, is just a drop in the bucket. Even if Giving Tuesday continues its exceptionally fast growth for another decade, it wouldnâ€™t be most charitiesâ€™ main source of funding.
Thatâ€™s probably a good thing. The best thing for charities is to get regular donations, ideally monthly recurring ones. While a day like Giving Tuesday can be a great occasion to put giving in the news and start a conversation about our ability to do good in the world, it wouldnâ€™t be good for it to become a make-or-break fundraising event for nonprofits.
The fact that Giving Tuesday contributions arenâ€™t yet measured in the billions doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t matter, though. It doesnâ€™t take millions of dollars to save a life â€” it is estimated you can save a life, or do a comparable amount of good, for only a few thousand. If the money moved on Giving Tuesday all went to effective lifesaving causes, last yearâ€™s fundraising would have saved 50,000 lives â€” not bad for a dayâ€™s work. (The money is actually spent on thousands of different charities, most of which donâ€™t collect enough data to estimate their impact. But there is clearly enough money to have tremendous significance.)
Thereâ€™s another way Giving Tuesday matters â€” itâ€™s a day when people are talking and thinking about giving back. Rachel Hutchinson, the vice president of corporate citizenship and philanthropy at Blackbaud, told me last year that coverage of Giving Tuesday suffered from â€œan overfocus on the dollars,â€ when money is far from the most important thing.
â€œWhat really matters here,â€ she said, â€œis people engaging with causes and causes they care about.â€
Curran echoed that: â€œWe absolutely support organizations raising money on Giving Tuesday, but itâ€™s a mistake to see Giving Tuesday as Fundraising Tuesday.â€
Giving Tuesday donors also seem interested in making sure theyâ€™re putting their money in the right places. GuideStar, an online guide to nonprofits, reported last year that Giving Tuesday 2018 was its highest trafficked day â€” suggesting donors were doing research before making choices on where to give.
For a sector of our economy where we spent $428 billion last year, with tens of thousands of organizations working on different projects, the question of how to do good in the world is not discussed enough. Itâ€™s probably a good thing for us to talk a little more about how we make the decisions that improve our world.
A day for getting better at doing good
Giving Tuesdayâ€™s organizers wonâ€™t tell people where to give or volunteer. Making the most of the occasion, though, requires thoughtfulness about the impact of your contributions, whatever form they take. Itâ€™s a great occasion to dive into the conversation about how to do good in the world. One of the reasons we need a day focused on giving is that most people care deeply about their communities, their causes, and the world â€” but donâ€™t necessarily know how to get the most results with their money, time, or career.
My colleague Dylan Matthews has written about some strategies to make your money go further â€” from checking with charity evaluators to targeting the poorest people to funding basic research and the development of new solutions to our problems. Effective altruist groups have developed resources for ensuring that the causes and charities theyâ€™re excited about can make the most out of the day, including donation matching events.
Ultimately, making the world a better place requires generosity and a dedication to measuring impact, talking about what we want to achieve, and gaining a better understanding of the problems weâ€™re trying to solve.

"The scandals, the leaks, the outrages, and the bizarre tweets of the last three years can distract from an important fact about President Donald Trump: He has changed policy in ways that affect the lives of millions of Americans.
Some of the Trump agenda is standard for a Republican president. White-collar criminal prosecutions have hit a 33-year low. The Justice Department defends state laws that could kick thousands off the voting rolls. The National Labor Relations Board is now more sympathetic to employers than unions. And military spending is on track to reach the same levels as during the height of the Iraq War.
But heâ€™s gone further. While the media, understandably, focuses on Trumpâ€™s many scandals, his administration has quietly enacted a far more aggressive agenda than his Republican predecessors. Big boosts to fossil fuel production have come at the expense of an unprecedented deterioration in air quality. Tens of thousands of people have lost health insurance by administrative fiat, and millions are in the process of losing their nutritional assistance through the same mechanism. Heâ€™s remade the judiciary, installing conservative judges at twice Obamaâ€™s pace, and heâ€™s consolidated a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that may endure for decades.
Tax changes were Trumpâ€™s biggest legislative accomplishment, creating a huge windfall for wealthy shareholders and small gains for the middle class â€” with revenue losses much larger than initially forecast. Heâ€™s also undertaken significant but little-noticed alternations in supervision of Wall Street that increase the riskiness of the banking system, plus drastic changes to immigration policy that go far beyond wall construction.
The immigration changes align with Trumpâ€™s main campaign themes, even if they donâ€™t line up in detail with what he promised. But much of this amounts to delivering for big business and the wealthy in a much more dramatic way than his â€œpopulistâ€ positioning would indicate. Promises to voters to protect clean air, provide better health care, crack down on banks, and tax the rich have fallen entirely by the wayside.
As 2020 approaches, Trumpâ€™s achievements are a reminder that Trump and his team are doing real things that have real impacts on real lives. His successes explain why the conservative movement is solidly behind him, despite its considerable doubts from four years ago. Regardless of what Trump tweets or says or does during the election, itâ€™s worth remembering thereâ€™s more to him than the Trump Show.
More oil and gas production, less environmental regulation
A major trend of Trump-era policymaking has been to roll back environmental regulation. This involves going through the process of promulgating new rules that are far more lax than those they replace. The New York Times has identified 53 separate rules that have completed the rollback process and 32 more that are still in the works.
Itâ€™s not unusual for Republican administrations to take a more skeptical view of environmental regulation, but the Trump administration really has been more uniformly aggressive on this front than its predecessors, as seen by criticism of the Trump Environmental Protection Agency by several of the agencyâ€™s Reagan- and Bush-era chiefs.

This reflects the growing polarization of environmental policy issues, which used to be less strictly aligned with larger left-right policy disputes. But it also reflects one of the key themes of Trump-era policymaking in general: a tendency toward recklessness with regard to politics and public opinion obscured in part by the large volume of coverage dedicated to Trump scandals and Trumpâ€™s personal behavior.
As a candidate, Trump was vocally skeptical of climate change regulations but specifically vowed â€œto promote clean air and water,â€ which are overwhelmingly popular causes. But Trump has moved to roll back dozens of rules on these subjects without the changes ever becoming a focus of sustained public debate.
Most of these rollbacksâ€™ impacts will be felt primarily in the long term, but already, particulate pollution is getting worse, reversing years of progress. A team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon estimates that 9,700 more Americans died due to air pollution in 2018 than in 2016, in part due to regulatory changes. But the Trump administration is moving to restrict the range of evidence used to demonstrate air pollutionâ€™s harms, hoping to forestall the promulgation of new standards that would lead to stricter regulation.
In tandem with the regulatory rollback, Trumpâ€™s goal of boosting Americaâ€™s natural resource extraction industries has been largely successful. There is no broad-based revival of the coal industry, but employment in coal mining has stabilized and is rising slightly in a reversal of recent trends. American oil output has soared to the point where net imports of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest level in generations and the country is likely to become a net exporter in the near future. Natural gas output, meanwhile, has soared to record highs, continuing a rapid growth pattern that began during the Obama presidency.
The reasons are more technological than regulatory, but policy has made a difference at the margins. Trump values boosting extractive industries over environmental protection, and energy production has increased substantially while the air gets dirtier and carbon dioxide emissions rise.
Paring back the welfare state
Trump speaks frequently, albeit somewhat vaguely, about his business deregulation activities.
But thereâ€™s a sphere of regulatory activism he speaks about much less: the paring back of the social safety net. Efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed in Congress, and while House Republicans briefly tried to mobilize around a program for cuts in a broad array of non-health safety net programs, their Senate colleagues werenâ€™t interested in taking it up. More recently, however, a more modest version of this agenda has been pursued through regulation.
That starts with allowing states to impose work requirements on their Medicaid programs. Arkansas was the first state to take this step, and nearly 20,000 people lost insurance as a result before a federal district court judge put the waivers on hold. Kentucky also received a work requirements waiver, but Andy Bevinâ€™s election as governor means his state will reverse course. Despite the district court ruling against the administration, it is likely to prevail at the higher levels of a judicial system that is increasingly dominated by GOP appointees.

Beyond the specifics of the Medicaid waiver fight, the uninsurance rate has risen steadily under Trump despite an improving labor market â€” seemingly because of the administrationâ€™s lack of interest in vigorous implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Heâ€™s also acted to re-legalize skimpy insurance plans that donâ€™t cover prescription drugs or maternity benefits.
The Trump administration has also launched a three-pronged rulemaking effort to limit federal spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). That started with tougher work requirements that could cost 755,000 people their benefits and was followed up by rule changes that would make about 3 million beneficiaries of a different anti-poverty program ineligible for SNAP. Most recently, the administration proposed some technical changes to how utility costs are calculated that will generate slightly higher benefits for 13 percent of SNAP recipients and larger benefit cuts to about 16 percent of SNAP recipients.
The scale of these changes is tiny compared to the massive cuts to the safety net once envisioned by former House Speaker Paul Ryan (to say nothing of Ryanâ€™s vision of cutting federal spending on the elderly), but the impact on the lives of several million people is substantial â€” and striking in light of the fact that reducing federal spending or narrowing the deficit donâ€™t appear to be goals the administration is seriously pursuing.
Trump reshaped the tax code
The Trump administration has only one really big legislative accomplishment to its name, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which initiated a range of changes in both individual and business taxation in the United States.
Republicans both in the administration and on Capitol Hill insisted that the tax cuts would pay for themselves through faster economic growth, which (predictably) hasnâ€™t happened. Whatâ€™s not as well known is that corporate tax revenue actually fell by more than anticipated in 2018 and has only marginally rebounded in 2019. In part as a result, the budget deficit has been rising faster than the Congressional Budget Office thought it would, even though lower-than-anticipated interest rates have helped the government save money. The big issue is that the investment boom boosters promised didn't come to fruition, any more than Republicans delivered on the promise of a tax code simple enough that you can file on a postcard.
At the same time, while many Democrats fumed about the huge increase in the deficit TCJA was sure to set off, itâ€™s very difficult to find any evidence that the increase in public borrowing has been a problem. Not only do the governmentâ€™s borrowing costs remain low, global macroeconomic conditions have been weak enough that the Federal Reserve ended up reversing course this year and slightly cutting interest rates. Under the circumstances, fiscal stimulus delivered by Trump (in the form not only of tax cuts, but also higher spending on both military and non-military categories) has been economically useful, whether or not you think his specific fiscal ideas make sense.

Beyond cutting rates, Trump has also reshaped the tax code in important ways. By substantially increasing the standard deduction, TCJA has reduced the number of families who itemize tax deductions and thus, in effect, made all deductions less valuable and economically important. Pairing this with a reduction in the amount of home mortgage interest that is eligible for tax deductibility has, in particular, narrowed the scope of the mortgage interest tax deduction â€” long seen as a sacred cow of the tax code â€” and done so without notably disrupting the real estate market.
TCJA also famously capped the deductibility of state and local taxes, a change thatâ€™s unfavorable to blue states and has sparked some half-hearted efforts by congressional Democrats to restore full deductibility. Reverting to the pre-Trump treatment of state and local taxes would, however, be a big tax cut for the rich â€” and itâ€™s noteworthy that none of the Democratic presidential candidates have embraced this rollback.
Taxes are always changing, and if Democrats do well in 2020, itâ€™s predictable that taxes will go up â€” especially on the rich â€” reversing much of the fiscal and economic impact of Trumpâ€™s bill. But the reshaping of the deductions landscape is likely to be a somewhat enduring, and arguably progressive, part of his legacy.
A bonanza for banks
As a candidate and at times in the early days of his administration, Trump espoused the idea of bringing back Glass-Steagall regulations that would have required the breakup of large financial services companies. That kind of talk evaporated quickly, however, and in office one of Trumpâ€™s most significant areas of policymaking has been a big step back from the more stringent financial regulations enacted in the wake of the financial crisis.
The clearest manifestation of that trend was a 2018 bill authored by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-ID) and backed by many moderate Democrats. There were a bunch of moving parts to this bill, but its key provision was raising the threshold for the highest level of regulatory scrutiny from banks with at least $50 billion in assets to banks with at least $250 billion in assets.

But legislative action is just the beginning of a much broader push. Trumpâ€™s Federal Reserve appointees promulgated a more â€œtailoredâ€ version of the Obama-era supplementary leverage rule, allowing the biggest banks to take on more debt and more risk. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought 40 percent fewer regulatory actions. His Financial Stability Oversight Council has removed the Obama administrationâ€™s designation of non-bank financial institutions as â€œsystemically significantâ€ and subject to stricter regulatory oversight.
Dodd-Frank requires large banks to maintain updated â€œliving willsâ€ that detail a plan to safely wind down operations in the event of a failure. Trump has relaxed the rule, allowing banks to update their plans once every four years rather than annually â€” sparing banks some hassle but raising the risk that outdated plans could blow up the banking system. The law also requires banks to submit to â€œstress testsâ€ that simulate their stability in the event of economic problems. Trumpâ€™s appointees have made the tests less frequent and also easier to pass.
The upshot of all this has been to make banks more profitable, which in turn has contributed to strong Trump-era stock market performance. And unlike in the pollution case, nothing bad necessarily happens when bank regulation becomes more lax â€” financial crises are inherently rare.
But, in a quiet behind-the-scenes way, a banking system that was made safer after the crisis is getting riskier again.
Trump has reshaped immigration
Immigration has been at the heart of Trumpâ€™s politics from the moment he descended the elevator at Trump Tower and announced he was running for office. And once he took office, he immediately set about changing immigration policy with the first version of his travel ban. But outside of the losing skirmish over funding for a border wall, there have barely been any efforts to get congressional action on immigration.
Despite the brief surge of attention to the family separation policy, the bulk of these changes have taken place with relatively little debate â€” though the cancellation of DACA, currently under review by the courts, will doubtless attract considerable attention if it does ultimately get approved by the Supreme Court.

As Voxâ€™s Nicole Narea has detailed, for example, the Trump administration â€œbuilt up, layer by layer, a series of impediments in Central America, at the border, in detention centers, and in the immigration courts that have made obtaining asylum nearly impossible.â€
But many of Trumpâ€™s changes have involved legal immigration rather than the hot-button topic of illegal immigration or the gray area of asylum-seeking. Trump has cut refugee resettlements by over 80 percent. Heâ€™s made it more difficult to get H-1B visas for skilled technology workers and is in the process of stripping their spouses of work permits.
Most recently, he is proposing new regulations that, according to the Migration Policy Institute, could bar hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants per year from the country by denying visas to would-be immigrants who cannot â€œprove to a consular officer that they will obtain health insurance within 30 days of their arrival in the US.â€ This has been put on hold by a district court, but like the Medicaid waivers issue, the decision will ultimately be made by higher courts that are stacked with Republican appointees.
A remade judiciary
Trump speaks frequently about his judicial appointments, in part because he has genuinely had a large impact here and in part because so much of the rest of his policy impact is inherently tied up with the courts.
With relatively little legislation under his belt, Trumpâ€™s policymaking has largely consisted of aggressive use of executive discretion. Thatâ€™s what Obama did during his second term, and conservatives found a means to counter it by identifying friendly jurisdictions to sue in and getting district courts to stay Obamaâ€™s actions pending further litigation. Democrats have responded in kind under Trump, and consequently many of his biggest regulatory changes have not yet fully taken effect.

The difference is that from day one Trump has enjoyed a GOP Senate majority and the new rules whereby judicial nominees cannot be filibustered by the minority. Consequently, Trump has seen federal judges appointed and confirmed at a record rate. Heâ€™s put 46 Circuit Court judges on the bench in three years compared to 55 across eight years of Obama, meaning a bit over a quarter of appeals court judges are now Trump appointees. If these judges ultimately rule in his favor, the short-term consequences for both immigration and the safety net will be large â€” over and above the obvious longer-term impact of the judiciary.
But the extent to which judicial nominations loom large in Trumpâ€™s policy rÃ©sumÃ© underscores how thin it is. The Senate has had ample floor time to consider his nominees because members simply havenâ€™t done much legislating. Thatâ€™s left Trump with executive actions that have certainly been consequential in spots â€” especially in his key areas of rhetorical focus around energy and immigration â€” but still a considerably smaller impact than his recent predecessors who all signed several major pieces of legislation."
"I downloaded Instagram in 2012, in the spring before what would be the worst summer of my life and the best autumn Iâ€™ve ever had. I remember them both vividly, sulking at home in the July heat on an air mattress in a sweltering bedroom I shared to save money, convinced my boyfriend was about to dump me.
He did, but it was fine; we got back together a week later, and by September I was studying abroad, city-hopping around Europe with people who would become some of my closest friends.
On my Instagram feed, though, the summer and fall of 2012 are indistinguishable from one another, except for in some photos I am in Brooklyn and others I am in Prague. It is a cohesive, Amaro-filtered grid of Park Slope lattes and Czech beer cans and my smiling face, posing next to friends old and new, with nothing to suggest these two periods of my life felt any different from each other.

Instagram has a way of flattening lived experiences so that my best years look exactly like my bad ones, and that everything seems pretty good, all the time, for everyone. This, obviously, is not how life works for most people, and ever since Instagram has existed experts have debated what seeing an infinite scroll of other peopleâ€™s happy moments is doing to our brains.
Lately that conversation has gotten louder and more complicated. Influencers, models, and celebrities â€” the people who Instagram was supposed to work best for â€” are realizing that they have been made complicit in an app that feeds its users a poison of narcissism and envy and prevents them from ever logging off. They try to reveal what happens outside the camera frame; that no, their lives arenâ€™t perfect either; that Instagram makes them feel bad, too. They share posts about authenticity and honesty and their quiet struggles with mental health that live directly next to posts devoted to toned ab muscles and champagne on yachts, which then makes the whole thing feel fake.
Now Instagram is trying to atone for what itâ€™s done to warp our perception of reality over the past almost-decade. The company is implementing new measures to shield its users from the hard parts, like bullying and body image issues, and trying to build a more â€œauthenticâ€ place for people to share photos and maybe also shop for clothes.
But whatâ€™s more authentic than the desire to make your life seem wonderful? Instagram succeeded because it exploited the basest aspects of human behavior until concepts like â€œauthenticityâ€ and â€œhonestyâ€ barely meant anything at all, to the point where even when we do see something vulnerable or â€œreal,â€ we inherently distrust it. On Instagram, and increasingly in real life, everyone is suspect. Even if Instagram deleted itself from the internet tomorrow, we couldnâ€™t get back what we lost.
Nobody ever thought Instagram was authentic. The first â€œInstagram vs. realityâ€ meme was uploaded to the internet in 2012, just two years after the app launched.
2012 was also the year that Facebook bought Instagram for a billion dollars, its largest acquisition at the time, as a way to break meaningfully into the mobile space. Back then, Instagram had 30 million users (it now has more than a billion), and over the next few years it would implement many of the changes that people hated about Facebook: non-chronological feeds and ever-changing algorithms, a seemingly-misguided push into video, as well as some elements it would steal from competitors.
An image posted to themetapicture in 2012 was among the first â€œInstagram vs. realityâ€ memes. Know Your Meme
The most famous example is Stories, a blatant ripoff of competitor Snapchatâ€™s core feature wherein users could upload photos and videos to their profiles that would self-destruct in 24 hours. Intended as a corrective to Instagramâ€™s overly curated aesthetic, Stories had existed on Snapchat since 2013, and contributed to the platformâ€™s association with the ephemeral and the goofy.
In 2016, Stories, with the same name and everything, came to Instagram, too. They were supposed to make the app more authentic, with the Stories tab as a place to show the behind-the-scenes version of the finished product that ended up on your grid. People had already built workarounds â€” â€œfinstas,â€ private secondary accounts that only a personâ€™s closest friends had access to, were for content that didnâ€™t have to be so serious â€” but Stories invited everyone on the platform to craft an additional alternate version of themselves, one that wasnâ€™t quite as polished as they were used to being on Instagram, but still curated enough to be shown to everyone they knew. If anything, Stories only increased the barrier for how â€œlikeâ€-able a photo had to be to end up on a userâ€™s grid.
None of this solved the Instagram vs. reality problem. A summer 2018 viral Twitter thread by the writer and podcaster Tracy Clayton illustrates how people were still taking and sharing nice-looking photos from terrible periods of their lives on Instagram all the time, and it remains the case a year-and-a-half later. The exception to the rule are people who use Instagram as an artistic outlet for mental anguish â€” the writer Jamie Lauren Keiles has written about their â€œdepressiongramsâ€ where they posted photos of pill bottles, psychiatric hospital bracelets, and ambient late-night DMs, and even then Keiles noted that these images too were constructed.
So what exactly are all these constructed images doing to us? While it certainly bears less responsibility for threatening global democracy than its older sibling Facebook, Instagram is linked with damaging the mental health of teenagers and young adults. A recent survey of almost 1,500 British young people showed that Instagram was considered the worst social media network for health and wellbeing, associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. It is a platform perfectly suited to exacerbate school bullying and negative body image, and as anyone who has spent as little as 10 seconds scrolling through it can attest, one that thrives on the endless ability of human beings to compare themselves to others and be found wanting.
Over the past few months, Instagram has been trying to atone for its sins. In July, it announced it would implement anti-bullying measures, including comment warnings that detect offensive or â€œborderlineâ€ content as a user is typing and prompt them to reconsider before posting, as well as a â€œrestrictâ€ option that would allow users to identify their bullies without outright blocking them, since blocking can be seen as an escalation of conflict. In September, Instagram said that it would begin restricting promotional posts about dieting products and cosmetic surgery so that users under 18 canâ€™t see them.
And as of November, Instagram is testing hiding likes in the US, after a series of tests in other countries. Users will still be able to see how many people liked their own photos, but no one else will be able to view that number. Though some believe the move heralded a death knell for influencers, many influencers themselves support the change. Instagram will still be Instagram, and the same people will still have influence.
â€œWe want everyoneâ€™s experience on Instagram to be intentional, positive and inspiring,â€ a Facebook spokesperson told me in a written statement. â€œWeâ€™re increasingly making decisions that prioritize the well-being of our community over our business â€” for example, reducing pressure on Instagram by hiding likes. We will continue to work alongside experts to develop new features in this space, like time management tools, whilst continuing our efforts to lead the industry in the fight against online bullying.â€
While generally put forth with positive intentions, these overdue measures ignore the fact that no matter how much Instagram would like to be viewed as a place users feel good about visiting, its entire existence is predicated on reminding people that other people are having more fun than they are.
There is a kind of reckoning happening right now. Popular influencers and average users alike are confessing how their relationships with Instagram have hurt them. Some acknowledge a kind of ownership over their part in perpetuating Instagramâ€™s feedback loop of terrible feelings. Even professionally hot, young celebrities â€” Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber, Madison Beer, and Kaia Gerber â€” have all posted photos with the same phone case that blares â€œSocial media seriously harms your mental healthâ€ much like a surgeon generalâ€™s warning.

In a piece for Refinery29, Eliza Brooke refers to this as a â€œpivot to anxietyâ€ at a time when speaking openly about mental health has become significantly less taboo. While for some it may be a refreshing turn towards transparency, the more cynical view argues these posts arenâ€™t really doing anything to subvert the worst parts of Instagram. â€œEven the most well-intentioned personal posts engage the same mechanics and reward systems that make Instagram toxic,â€ Brooke writes.
Brooke Erin Duffy, a professor at Cornellâ€™s communications department, recently conducted a study of the relationship of 25 influencers to what they perceived as â€œauthenticity.â€ There are academic terms for the balancing act between performing a lifestyle worth aspiring to and still convincing followers that it isnâ€™t an act at all: â€œcalibrated amateurism,â€ â€œcalculated authenticity,â€ â€œcurated imperfection,â€ â€œaspirational ordinariness.â€ None of these concepts is new.
When Dale Carnegie wrote How to Win Friends and Influence People in 1936, he offered the same advice of being as sincere as possible while strategically pursuing your own gains. But on social media, thereâ€™s an expectation that even if you know what youâ€™re seeing isnâ€™t â€œreal,â€ it should be.
â€œEvery couple months we hear that weâ€™re finally rejecting these codes of performativity. So why donâ€™t we focus on another ideal?â€
Instagram wants its users to know it hears them: The enigmatic algorithm, an eternal source of agony for influencers, has begun to favor more â€œrealisticâ€ content. Naturally, this has led many influencers who built their following crafting idyllic-looking lives to now show a smidgeon more chaos and candor in their photos in service of chasing the tweaked algorithm, which is still fundamentally the same one that made everyone feel terrible about themselves to begin with.
The perfectly crafted Instagram post is dead, but its replacement â€” the Instagram post that looks like it hasnâ€™t been crafted at all â€” often requires just as much effort to produce. Sure, the aesthetics of â€œauthenticityâ€ might now be explicitly encouraged by the Instagram algorithm, but true authenticity, which on Instagram would have to amount to a kind of constant, unfiltered live-streaming of oneâ€™s life, has never been its purpose.
â€œEvery couple months we hear that weâ€™re finally rejecting these codes of performativity,â€ Duffy says. â€œThereâ€™s this idea of a post-authenticity age â€” like, weâ€™re all in on the game. We all know that no ideal, true, pure quality of authenticity really exists. So why donâ€™t we focus on another ideal?â€ But what would that even be?

Here is the thing about Instagram: Even when you know it isnâ€™t real, that social media is a highlight reel of peopleâ€™s lives and you shouldnâ€™t compare yourself to anyone else, that itâ€™s a trap and it will only make you feel bad about your life, which is overall probably a perfectly fine one, Instagram still has real, material consequences. Being good at Instagram is a ticket to more likes, more followers, more tiny hits of dopamine and ultimately more fame and money; a platform to launch a creative project and sell it, to be able to live the life weâ€™re supposed to want.
â€œThatâ€™s something I keep trying to wrap my head around,â€ Duffy says. A lot of the idealization of the Instagram influencer, she says, has to with the fact that people have always glamorized the kind of fields â€” music, art, media â€” wherein you theoretically get paid to do what you love. As the saying goes, if you do that, youâ€™ll never have to work a day in your life.
As much as Instagram is a place where bullying, harassment, and hurt feelings are rampant, it has also become profoundly boring.
Thatâ€™s a lie, of course. The reality is that getting paid to be yourself means that you are always working, and therefore your work self, your Instagram self, festers into your actual self until the version that many thousands of people are supposedly paying attention to becomes much more important than the living, breathing body who built it.
Your Instagram self, then, has to become one thatâ€™s palatable to the greatest number of people possible. On a platform that rewards follower counts above literally all else, you have to be everything to everyone â€” pretty but not too sexy (nipple ban!), successful but not too envy-inducing (lest others find you unrelatable!), authentic but not too real (no one wants to hear about your marriage problems!).
All this has contributed to the underlying fact that as much as Instagram is a place where bullying, harassment, and hurt feelings are rampant, it has also become profoundly boring. In our endless quest to chase the Instagram algorithm, now that we know what it wants from us â€” authenticity, supposedly, but mostly just the aesthetics of it â€” we resort to only the safest content, the things we know will convince people to double tap. We stay in our lanes; we adhere to the personal brands that have become happy little avatars for a life that everyone else thinks weâ€™re living.

In doing so, weâ€™ve also become distrustful of anything we see, even the stuff thatâ€™s pushing back against Instagramâ€™s unpleasantness. When Olivia Muenter, a body positive fashion writer with nearly 19,000 Instagram followers, wrote a confessional post about how influence and authenticity were often at odds, the first comment I saw read: â€œCanâ€™t tell you how many posts like this Iâ€™ve read recently about authenticity etc. and I get to the end and itâ€™s sponsored by like deodorant or pre-made smoothie bowls or something. Iâ€™ve come to expect it.â€
Her post wasnâ€™t sponsored, but in truth, Iâ€™d been prepared to see the same thing: a veneer of â€œrealnessâ€ to gloss over the only real thing about the post, which is that it was a business deal. Instagram has created a universe where even the most intentionally authentic posts look fake, where we believe everyone participating is only there for money and clout.
Even if we are all only on Instagram for money and clout, which I donâ€™t think is true for the vast majority of users, how bad would that be, really? On TikTok, the video app that many in Gen Z prefer over Instagram, users regularly include in their bios something to the effect of â€œjust tryna get famous,â€ which, ultimately is a lot more authentic than admitting that sometimes your three kids make life difficult or that you feel sad sometimes. Who doesnâ€™t?
No matter how many new features or policies it implements, Instagram wonâ€™t ever become a bastion of realness and authenticity. If anything, newer social media platforms will become more like Instagram. As the stakes for each user rise with each new follower and set of eyeballs, and as they become increasingly entwined with identity performance, the more boring â€” and untrustworthy â€” everyone else will be. The Instagram problem persists.

"This article contains spoilers for Watchmenâ€™s seventh episode.
Sometimes HBO reminds us, in the best way possible, that its take on Watchmen is a comic book show after all. Episode seven is a prime example of how a well-executed plot twist can change everything that we thought we knew and make us re-watch and re-think everything all over again.
After a week to breathe and ruminate on the repercussions of episode sixâ€™s big reveal â€” that Angelaâ€™s grandpa Will Reeves was the pioneer hero known as Hooded Justice â€” the show hit a lever and plunged us down another narrative trap door.
Angelaâ€™s husband Cal is actually Jon, as in Jon Osterman, a.k.a. Doctor Manhattan, and Angela knew this entire time.
As Lady Trieu informs Angela, full blown amnesia, which Cal suffers from, is quite rare. She hints that thereâ€™s something more beneath the surface of Angelaâ€™s doting and loyal husband.
And there is!
Angela bludgeons Cal to death with a hammer, and digs a tiny device from his bashed-in skull. She needs to â€œwake upâ€ Jon. Desperate times call for desperate measures.
The 7th Kavalry, a.k.a. Cyclops, spearheaded by Senator Joe Keene, is launching an attack that they hope will give them the powers of Doctor Manhattan himself. They want to restore balance and power to white men. How exactly theyâ€™re going to go about doing this is anyoneâ€™s guess, but Angela and Jon are in imminent danger.

Some Watchmen fans are mad that HBOâ€™s version is political. But Watchmen has always been political.
While Jonâ€™s identity as Cal caught me and likely my fellow viewers by surprise, the show gave us some major hints in previous episodes that the comicâ€™s omnipotent blue being was masquerading as Angelaâ€™s amnesiac husband.
The only question left unanswered, though, is: why?
Laurie Blake meets her godly ex-boyfriend
Laurie Blake grilling Angela in Watchmen, episode four. HBO
The writing may have been on the wall as far back as the first half of the season. Back in episode four, Laurie Blake has a conversation with Angela on their way to Lady Trieuâ€™s headquarters as the pair investigate Judd Crawfordâ€™s death. Laurie starts talking to Angela pretty casually about her ex, and then says something that makes Angela sit straight up.
â€œMy ex used to talk about them [thermodynamic miracles] when he wasnâ€™t distracted by fucking quarks,â€ Laurie says, talking about the miraculous feat of science that allowed Angelaâ€™s car and Will to be taken up into the sky. â€œYeah, well, heâ€™s no Cal.â€
â€œExcuse me?â€ Angela says, shocked.
â€œCal, your husband. I saw him today. We had a nice chat,â€ Laurie says. â€œYou guys met in Vietnam, right?â€
In the context of our new revelation about who and where Doctor Manhattan is, the meaning behind this conversation changes. Originally, you could read it as Angela being annoyed by Laurieâ€™s lack of boundaries and prying into her personal life. That interpretation doesnâ€™t change when re-watching this conversation after episode seven, but now that we know Angela is keeping Doctor Manhattan in a human suit, it adds another layer of shock that Laurie in particular interviewed Cal â€” she was Doctor Manhattanâ€™s old lover, after all.
Laurie and Jon in Watchmen Gibbons/DC
In the comic books, Laurie is Doctor Manhattanâ€™s primary love interest. She loves him, but their relationship is strained because he begins to transcend humanity. Granted, anyone transcending their own humanity might be emotionally unavailable, but in Jonâ€™s case, his powers and near-omnipotence make him feel like heâ€™s become an outsider to humanity. He canâ€™t empathize with humans, because heâ€™s become something more powerful, more knowing, and more than human.

Watchmenâ€™s Doctor Manhattan dildo is as important as it is large
If thereâ€™s anyone that can relate to Angelaâ€™s experience with Jon, itâ€™s Laurie. And if thereâ€™s anyone that can spot Jon, itâ€™s also going to be Laurie â€” hence Angelaâ€™s deep trepidation when Laurie says she met with Cal, whom she doesnâ€™t yet know is her former lover. (Or does she?)
Cal has no backstory, beyond meeting Angela in Vietnam
Jon leaving his world in Watchmen Gibbons/DC
In the original comic, Jon leaves the planet after the giant squid attack. Going off of that, it doesnâ€™t really make sense how he and Angela would meet. But while Jon might be off playing God on another planet (which is where Iâ€™m betting he left Adrian Veidt, a.k.a. Ozymandias), there is no rule that he has to actually stay on that planet in the show. He could have conceivably come back to Earth at any time.
The show is comparably specific about where Angela comes from, grounding her background in Vietnam. But it isnâ€™t the same Vietnam of our real world. In Watchmen, the United States won the Vietnam War, and the country became part of the United States as a result. Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s a massive fandom around Jon/Doctor Manhattan as a liberating hero in Vietnam, which we see at the beginning of episode seven when Angela is a little girl. Given that Lady Trieu and Laurie both say that Angela and Cal met in Vietnam, it points to Jon landing in Vietnam for whatever reason, and Angela encountering him while there.

In 1986, Watchmen skewered the way we love superheroes. Itâ€™s still as relevant as ever.
So why is Jon in Vietnam, possibly after exiling himself to space? The comic book gives us one clue.
Toward the end of the graphic novel, Laurie finds out that sheâ€™s the daughter of Eddie Blake, also known as the supervillain, The Comedian, and the man who tried to rape her mother Sally. Sally and Eddie eventually had a consensual relationship, and Laurie was born. Sallyâ€™s forgiveness of Eddie to birth Laurie, believe it or not, is what convinces Jon that humanity is worth saving. He calls the idea of two people who shouldnâ€™t be in love yet find a way, a miracle that takes â€œthe breath awayâ€:
Jon explaining to Laurie that love is truly a miracle Gibbons/DC
To be clear, the way Moore has depicted women, particularly Sally falling in love with a man who tries to rape her, has been criticized. But the thing to focus on here is that Jon, even in his strange, distant way, can be a little romantic in that he believes in love and has faith in humanity. He could see Angela in this same light â€” a thermodynamic miracle that comes once in a lifetime that he needs to be with. Finding his soulmate could be just the thing to bring him back from another planet or another galaxy.
Angela and Calâ€™s kids are adopted with a strange arrangement
Jon forming himself in Watchmen Gibbons/DC
Full disclosure: I am not a biologist with the breadth of knowledge to understand what the logistics of a human woman like Angela having children with an omnipotent being like Jon would entail.
Jon does have the ability to change his size, and when he was vaporized, he displayed the power to change his physiology. This could mean that he and Angela could have children could conceive the way humans do. Though one would think that those children would end up with Jonâ€™s powers or his blue skin, and if that happened, theyâ€™d be hunted down by the 7th Kavalry or anyone hungry for Jonâ€™s powers.
It makes sense, then, that she and Jon have adopted children, but they seem to have adopted them through a non-traditional process.
In the third episode, a man shows up on Angelaâ€™s porch demanding to see the kids, and she writes him a check and sends him away. The specifics of their legal visitation rights are unknown, but Iâ€™d imagine itâ€™d be difficult for Angela and Cal/Jon to adopt a child through the traditional processes, because doing so would require a background check into Jonâ€™s life as well as references. And the latter is difficult to do if Jon has no knowledge of who he really is and more or less has no human past as Cal.
Why is Angela hiding him?
In episode seven, Senator Joe Keene tells Laurie Blake of his plan to capture Jon and steal his powers. Lady Trieu tells Angela more or less the same thing â€” she needs to save the world from Keene and Cyclopsâ€” and Doctor Manhattan is indeed walking the Earth as a human man.
It would then seem that Angela and Jonâ€™s plan to hide Jon in plain sight under the guise of a human amnesiac named Cal was preventative in anticipation of Keeneâ€™s grand plan. The comic book might tell us more:
Jon experiences time differently than humans DC Comics
While Jon is essentially omnipotent, he also possesses a type of omniscience. He can see himself at various points in his life at any time. In the panels above, he is having an argument with his ex-girlfriend Janey Slater in 1959. During that argument, he sees himself in the future arguing with her in 1963, and then her lonely and sobbing in 1966.
If Jon were to be with Angela in Vietnam, he would then be able to see his future with her when they move to Tulsa and have a family. He would also be able to anticipate the Cyclops attack that Lady Trieu warns of and Joe Keene confirms, and possibly hiding himself as Cal would be the best option.
The wrinkle in that plan, though, is the â€œWhite Nightâ€ attack on Angela and her partner that took place before the events of the show. The White Night was when the police force in Tulsa was slaughtered, the act of violence that prompted legislation allowing police officers to keep their faces and identities hidden.
As Angela explained to Topherâ€™s class in episode one, the attack caught her by surprise, and she was shot by 7th Kavalry members. But in the flashback, we see that Angela and Jon/Cal are enjoying themselves on Christmas Eve. Jonâ€™s powers would allow him to see that attack happening, but itâ€™s odd that he didnâ€™t warn Angela.
This relies on the assumption that Angela married Cal knowing he was Jon the entire time versus a possible (but not necessarily one I believe) scenario in which Jon has been impersonating Cal the entire time; Angela may not have been fully informed of Jonâ€™s past and his powers.
This seems to indicate that, while Jon is Cal, his knowledge of himself and his powers are blocked, thus making the attack on Angela and himself possible â€” he wouldnâ€™t be able to prevent it.
But if Jon and Angela were hiding Jon to avoid Keeneâ€™s plan, did the White Night attack alter Jonâ€™s future? Judging from Angelaâ€™s desperate response of bludgeoning Cal and waking up Jon after her meeting with Lady Trieu, it seems things are not going according to plan.
Thereâ€™s also the notion that something happened during the White Night attack that alerted Police Chief Judd Crawford to Jonâ€™s real identity. We now know that Judd staged the attack, but he spared Angela and Jon. Judd probably didnâ€™t call off the attack out of the goodness of his heart â€” and it seems more likely now, as Keeneâ€™s plan of capturing Jon comes into focus, that he found out about Jon and Angelaâ€™s secret during the White Night attacks. Perhaps weâ€™ll see this all come together a bit more in episode eight, though I wouldnâ€™t be surprised to be thrown another twist."
"New details about President Donald Trumpâ€™s hold on military aid for Ukraine â€” a matter at the heart of the House impeachment inquiry â€” emerged on Tuesday, due to a newly released witness transcript and a New York Times scoop.
Mark Sandy was the sole official from the White House Office of Management and Budget â€” the office that implemented the hold â€” to testify behind closed doors to impeachment investigators. And Democrats released the transcript of that testimony Tuesday evening.
Sandy said that two OMB officials resigned at least in part due to concerns over the Ukraine aid hold. He also clarified the timeline of the hold, saying he first got questions about it in June, and that the decision had been made to implement it by mid-July. He also said that the key OMB official involved in the process was Michael Duffey â€” a political appointee and Republican operative who has refused to testify.
Also Tuesday evening, the New York Timesâ€™s Michael Schmidt, Julian Barnes, and Maggie Haberman reported for the first time on when Trump learned about the whistleblower complaint filed against him regarding Ukraine. They say he was briefed in late August â€” which may help explain why Trump reportedly started insisting there was â€œno quid pro quoâ€ days later.
Overall, these new details donâ€™t answer every remaining question about the hold on Ukraine aid, but they do tell us more about how it happened â€” and what Trump knew at the time.
Sandy said two OMB officials quit over this, but details are scant
The headline news from Sandyâ€™s testimony is that he revealed that two officials at the OMB actually left their posts â€” both, in part, due to concerns over the Ukraine aid holdup and its process.
However, Sandy does not name these officials and provides few details on them.
One, Sandy said, â€œexpressed some frustrations about not understanding the reason for the hold,â€ and then resigned in September.
The other official who resigned worked in the OMBâ€™s legal division, according to Sandy. â€œThis person expressed to me concerns about actions vis-a-vis the Impoundment Control Actâ€ over the Ukraine aid hold, Sandy said â€” suggesting the person was concerned the hold was illegal.
Sandy clarified the timeline for the aid holdup
As Sandy tells it, his involvement with the Ukraine saga began on June 19, when he â€œheard that the president had seen a media reportâ€ about hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine, and that â€he had questions.â€
Sandy canâ€™t remember what the exact media report was, but one that fits the description is this Washington Examiner piece on that date, headlined: â€œPentagon to send $250M in weapons to Ukraine.â€ So this may be when the military aid for Ukraine first caught Trumpâ€™s attention.
Sandy also explained how OMB communicated with the White House on the matter. The key line of communication was between the Robert Blair â€” an aide to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney â€” and Michael Duffey, a political appointee at OMB. (Duffey was previously the executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin.)
After this initial June inquiry, word trickled down that Trump wanted a hold on the Ukraine aid. Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, a staffer for the NSC, testified that on July 3, he heard that some of the aid might be blocked. Sandy, though, testified that he saw an email dated July 12 â€” from Blair in the White House, to Duffey at OMB â€” saying Trump wanted a hold on the aid. On July 18, an OMB staffer announced on a call with various officials that the aid would be blocked.
Sandy put the process in motion over the coming days. But he said he was confused about one thing: why was this happening? â€œThere was certainly a desire to learn more about the rationaleâ€ for blocking the aid, he said. But at this point, no one could provide an explanation.
All that means the decision to block the aid was made before Trumpâ€™s July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Then, hours after the call was over, Sandy officially implemented it.
A few days after that, on July 30, Sandy says the responsibility for approving specific funds (such as the Ukraine aid) was taken away from him â€” and was given to Duffey, the political appointee, instead.
Only much later, in September, does Sandy recall hearing some sort of explanation for the aid hold. Duffey sent an email â€œthat attributed the hold to the Presidentâ€™s concern about other countries not contributing more to Ukraine,â€ Sandy testified. (There have recently been reports that unreleased White House emails show an effort to concoct an after-the-fact justification for the hold on the aid, and this could be part of that.)
But Sandy, the transcript makes clear, was not really in the loop on the White Houseâ€™s plans. It was actually Duffey, and he has refused to testify. But we may learn more about him soon enough â€” the New York Times filed a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit seeking emails between Duffey and Blair.
Trump learns of the whistleblower complaint â€” and, about two weeks later, lets the aid through
Throughout most of August, Trump officials like Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland tried to make a quid pro quo deal in which the Ukrainians would make some announcement about the investigations Trump wanted. However, these discussions appear to have focused on a White House meeting for Zelensky â€” not the blocked aid.
Then, at some unspecified date in late August â€” likely on or after August 26 â€” lawyers for the White House counselâ€™s office briefed Trump that a whistleblower complaint had been filed. According to the New York Times, Trumpâ€™s aides explained â€œthey were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress.â€ So at this point, Trump clearly knew about the whistleblower complaint, but may have hoped it could still be covered up.
Around this same time, on August 28, word finally leaked out that Trump had blocked the aid. Zelenskyâ€™s adviser Andriy Yermak panicked and tried to ascertain what was going on, and on September 1, Sondland told him that the aid also hinged on the investigations announcement.
An intense effort to strong-arm the Ukrainians proceeded over the ensuing days. Sondland claimed to be talking with both Trump and Zelensky, and said that while Trump insisted there was â€œno quid pro quo,â€ he was adamant that Zelensky make the announcement on investigations.
Then, between September 9 and 11, several things happened:
The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote a letter to Congress telling it that the administration was withholding a whistleblower complaint.
Three House committees announced a â€œwide-ranging investigationâ€ into â€œefforts by President Trump, the presidentâ€™s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and possibly others to pressure the government of Ukraine to assist the presidentâ€™s reelection campaign.â€ (The whistleblower had previously spoken to a staffer for Rep. Adam Schiff, who chairs one of those committees, so it seems they knew at least the general theme of what was going on.)
National Security Adviser John Bolton, who knew a lot about this Ukraine plot, departed the Trump administration on bad terms.
Diplomat Bill Taylor put his concerns about what was happening in writing, texting Gordon Sondland: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.â€
Republican senators who supported the aid, like Rob Portman of Ohio, continued to lobby the White House to let it through.

So, on September 11, the Trump administration sent word that they would let the aid through after all.
Many interpret this as Trump â€œcavingâ€ because the heat was on, or because he â€œgot caught.â€ However, another possibility is that he thought the deal was in hand â€” both Taylor and State Department official David Holmes testified they believed the Ukrainians seemed set to still make the announcement after September 11. (They never did.)"
"Before we inevitably arrive at the alleged war on Christmas this holiday season, weâ€™ve first got to tackle the â€¦ war on Thanksgiving? Which is supposedly a thing now, too. At least according to President Donald Trump.
Conservative media and some Republicans have for years claimed that Christmas is under attack, turning some peopleâ€™s decision to say â€œHappy Holidaysâ€ instead of â€œMerry Christmasâ€ during the month of December into a culture war touchstone to try to spark outrage on the right. Trump has embraced the â€œwar on Christmasâ€ narrative, and now heâ€™s taking it a step further: heâ€™s claiming liberals are out to get Thanksgiving, too.
At a rally in Florida on Tuesday, the president confoundingly reassured supporters that he wouldnâ€™t let the â€œradical leftâ€ change Thanksgivingâ€™s name. â€œAs we gather for Thanksgiving, you know, some people want to change the name Thanksgiving. They donâ€™t want to use the term Thanksgiving,â€ Trump said. He later continued: â€œPeople have different ideas why it shouldnâ€™t be called Thanksgiving, but everybody in this room, I know, loves the name Thanksgiving. And weâ€™re not changing.â€
Itâ€™s not clear who on the left Trump believes is trying to change the name of Thanksgiving, which is a secular American holiday. Itâ€™s true there is some cultural strife surrounding the day, including its historical weight for Native Americans and its environmental impact, but thereâ€™s not some broad push to change the name of the holiday altogether.
Trumpâ€™s remarks quickly took off online, with the hashtags #WarOnThanksgiving and #WhatLiberalsCallThanksgiving trending on Twitter, largely ironically. Some conservatives, on the other hand, have tried to find ways to back up the presidentâ€™s claims.
The president has leaned into culture wars often throughout his tenure, aware that itâ€™s a way to rally his base and sow division. Declaring out of the blue that thereâ€™s a movement on the left to change the name of Thanksgiving is another example of that. But the episode also highlights the presidentâ€™s dismissiveness of issues with some real cultural and social weight. While Thanksgivingâ€™s name isnâ€™t particularly controversial, its history is.
The war on Thanksgiving is a watered-down version of the war on Christmas
While there isnâ€™t a war on Thanksgiving, that didnâ€™t stop Fox News from exploring what the president could have meant. On Fox and Friends Wednesday morning, the hosts noted that there was once a false rumor that President Barack Obama wanted to change Thanksgivingâ€™s name years ago (they even acknowledged on-air that it wasnâ€™t true) and mentioned that some environmentally-conscious people have expressed concerns about Thanksgivingâ€™s carbon footprint. They emphasized the â€œtraditionâ€ of the holidayâ€™s name and its expression of gratitude.
It makes sense that Fox News would go along with Trumpâ€™s Thanksgiving claims a little bit, given the role the network has played for years in pushing the narrative of the war on Christmas.
As Liam Stack explained in the New York Times in 2016, the modern idea of the attack on Christmas stems from Fox Newsâ€™s promotion of a 2005 book by radio host John Gibson that â€œalleged liberal antagonism toward the holiday.â€ Since-ousted Fox News host Bill Oâ€™Reilly leaned into the concept, it took off from there. Every year, the outlet complains that phrases such as â€œHappy Holidays,â€ or the attempts of secular spaces such as schools to make the holiday season more inclusive, amount to an assault on one of the Christian religionâ€™s biggest holidays of the year. Even the Starbucks holiday cup has become a point of contention.
Trump, who often tries to appeal to the Christian right for political support and knows a good cultural controversy when he sees one, has taken the war on Christmas and run with it. Since he first ran for president, heâ€™s been promising to reject the so-called â€œwar on Christmasâ€ and invoked it as another way to rally his supporters against the perceived overreach of political correctness in the United States. And, staying true to form, heâ€™s claimed victory, repeatedly telling voters that weâ€™re finally saying â€œMerry Christmasâ€ again.
He did the same thing on Tuesday when he brought up Thanksgiving. â€œNow everybodyâ€™s using Christmas again. Remember this?â€ he said.
Itâ€™s not a bad idea to give Thanksgiving a think
For all you Thanksgiving aficionados out there, nobodyâ€™s coming to take away your turkey, your stuffing, or your cranberry sauce. (Side note: Have you seen Voxâ€™s definitive ranking of Thanksgiving sides?) But that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s not worth considering that the holiday isnâ€™t the same for everyone and for all communities.
For Native Americans, the holiday can be a painful one, not a time to celebrate but instead a time to remember the atrocities they suffered when Europeans landed in America, and to note that the story in many history books about the Pilgrims and Native Americans is not an accurate one.
Since 1970, some Native Americans have instead been observing the National Day of Mourning, a protest and remembrance of â€œthe genocide of millions of Native people, the theft of Native lands, and the relentless assault on Native culture.â€ They gather in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Thanksgiving each year.
â€We go there every year, along with many nonindigenous allies, as well, to talk about the truth about Thanksgiving,â€ Mahtowin Munro, co-leader of the United American Indians of New England, which organizes the protest, told CNN.
Itâ€™s not clear whether this protest is what Trump was referencing, but if it was, itâ€™s hardly a leftist effort to rename a holiday â€” rather, itâ€™s an effort to highlight the countryâ€™s history from an underrepresented perspective.
Some environmental groups have also pushed for more conversation about the environmental impact of Thanksgiving, including the food consumed (and wasted) and travel. Again, not bad to think about, but also not an attack on Thanksgiving.
Will Trumpâ€™s claims of a war on Thanksgivings have legs? Itâ€™s hard to tell, but given the Christmas season basically starts now, he, Fox News, and the rest of the culture war-stoking conservative media are likely to turn to Christmas instead. At least we now have the tweets and memes."
"This is part three of a four-part series on carbon capture and utilization (CCU), the growing industry dedicated to using carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere to fight climate change. Part one introduces CCU and its basic forms, and part two is about enhanced oil recovery as a use of CO2. The fourth post will look at how policymakers should approach CCU technologies.
It is well understood at this point that carbon dioxide is a deadly pollutant that is heating the atmosphere. Whatâ€™s less well understood is that CO2 is also a useful feedstock, an input into a variety of industrial processes. From plastics to concrete, CO2 is a basic industrial building block â€” a valuable commodity.
To many climate campaigners, this suggests that maybe we should use more of it. Maybe, if the industries that use CO2 could be incentivized to increase their use, we could use enough to substantially decrease the amount we emit into the atmosphere.
Use more; emit less. That is the basic idea behind carbon capture and utilization (CCU), one of the hottest topics in clean energy these days.
In my first post in this series, I introduced the concept of CCU and its basic forms. In the second, I took a close look at what is currently the most common industrial use of CO2, namely enhanced oil recovery (EOR), whereby CO2 is injected in spent wells to squeeze out more oil and gas. (Itâ€™s complicated.)
In this post, weâ€™re going to take a look at the other industrial uses of CO2 to try to get a sense of how viable they are, what their total potential might be, and whether they might play a significant role in the fight against climate change. Fun times!
One important note: For the purposes of this post, Iâ€™m looking at industrial processes. They involve pulling CO2 out of the air â€” either out of the flue gases of industrial facilities, via traditional carbon capture, or out of the ambient air, via direct air capture (DAC) â€” concentrating it, and using it as industrial feedstock.
There are also a number of natural ways of gathering more CO2, from planting more forests to sequestering more carbon in the soil. They are interesting and of potentially significant scale, but they deserve their own post. This post is about machines.

Three important ways to assess CCU technologies
Before we get into the various forms of CCU, letâ€™s keep in mind three important questions we need to be asking about all of them as we take their measure.
The questions are drawn from a giant literature review on CCU, recently released in the journal Nature, which assessed over 11,000 papers and was accompanied by an expert opinion survey. It helps bring into clear focus the key metrics involved in appraising these technologies.
The first question is, does the CCU technology produce a climate benefit? Does it reduce carbon emissions, and if so, how much? Does it sequester carbon, and if so, for how long?
There are a few overlapping concepts here that are often conflated in popular dialogue, so itâ€™s worth distinguishing them. Hereâ€™s how the Nature paper does it:
CO2u: utilization of CO2
CO2Ï: reduction in CO2 emissions relative to baseline
CO2r: removal of CO2 from the atmosphere
CO2s: storage of CO2
Ways to use CO2. Royal Society
Different CCU technologies involve different mixes of these. Determining the net carbon impact of a CCU technology involves life-cycle analysis (LCA) that takes into account where the CO2 is sourced, how much energy is used in production, where the energy comes from, how much CO2 is released during production, whether any of the released CO2 is captured, how the product is eventually disposed of, and what would have taken place in the absence of the production. (LCA is devilishly complicated and there are currently no widely shared standards governing how itâ€™s done.)
Some uses of CO2 â€” say, making liquid fuels that substitute for gasoline and diesel fuel â€” only lock in carbon until the fuel is combusted, at which point it is re-released into the atmosphere. They donâ€™t remove CO2 from the atmosphere so much as recycle it once and then put it back; the Nature paper calls them â€œcyclingâ€ processes. But by substituting a carbon-neutral process for a carbon-intensive one, they reduce net emissions (CO2Ï) relative to what would have happened otherwise.
Other uses of CO2 â€” say, as part of the cement-production process â€” lock in carbon for much longer. Concrete wonâ€™t permanently keep CO2 out of the atmosphere, but could plausibly store it for a century or longer, so for all intents and purposes it counts as carbon storage (CO2s). The Nature paper calls these â€œclosedâ€ processes.
LCA is complex, and the details matter, but one broad conclusion from the literature is that â€œthe potential for net emission reductions is much larger than for net removals, which appears very modest.â€ Overall, CCU probably wonâ€™t result in a lot of CO2s, but it could produce considerable CO2Ï.
Assessing the climate benefit of different CCU options is paramount. Policymakers should always keep in mind that CCU is not a good in and of itself. It is only worth pursuing insofar as it makes a meaningful climate difference.
The second question is, what is the potential scale of the CCU technology? If itâ€™s a specialized or low volume product, it might not be worth the R&D effort to figure out how to make it work commercially with captured CO2. It stands to reason that policymakers and investors should prioritize their attention and resources based on the technologies with the largest total potential. (Weâ€™ll look at a ranking of technologies by potential in a moment.)
And the third question is, how far along is the CCU technology on the learning curve? Is it a speculative technology that exists mostly in the lab and a few pilot projects, like synthetic liquid fuels, or is it an established technology with near-term potential for market growth, like CO2 in cement?
All these questions are important in assessing the potential of CCU technologies to provide practical climate solutions.
So what are those technologies? Letâ€™s take a look at a few.
The CCU cycle, in all its glory. Nature
(There are lots of different ways of dividing them up; my list is a bit of a mash-up of the Nature paper referenced above and this exhaustive 2016 roadmap conducted by Lux Research for the Global CO2 Initiative.)
1. Concrete building materials
There are several technologies here, all related to concrete, which is a mix of cement, water, and aggregates. The cement is a fine powder that, when activated by the water, binds the aggregates into a rigid mix.
First, aggregates â€” which are incorporated into concrete, asphalt, and construction fill â€” can be made by converting gaseous CO2 into solid mineral carbonates like calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a process known as â€œCO2 mineralization.â€ (See Blue Planet.)
Second, CO2 can be substituted for water in â€œcuringâ€ concrete during its mixing, resulting in a similar mineralization. It turns out this actually makes the resulting concrete stronger, in addition to saving lots of water. (See, for example, Solidia and CarbonCure.)
Third, cement can be phased out in favor of new binding agents that absorb and mineralize CO2. (See CO2 Concrete.)
Fourth, and most speculative, is a promising tech being pushed by the EUâ€™s Low Emissions Intensity Lime & Cement (LEILAC) project. The production process for cement and lime involves chemical reactions (not fossil fuel combustion) that inevitably release CO2. LEILAC seeks to tweak the process so that it creates a purified CO2 waste stream that can easily be captured and either sequestered or reused.
At least in theory, one can imagine purified CO2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process captured and then re-injected into the process as a CO2-mineralizing bonding agent is mixed with CO2-based aggregates. If all those pieces could be lined up â€” and to be clear, thatâ€™s not being done anywhere in the world yet â€” the resulting building materials might have a claim to being truly carbon negative, on a lifecycle basis. They would not only reduce net emissions (CO2Ï), they would semi-permanently store carbon (CO2s).
But short of that, even if cement achieves only CO2Ï, not CO2s, the opportunity here is large and immediate. These technologies (at least the first two) are established and relatively low energy; they could potentially result in carbon sequestration on the scale of billions of tons.
2. Liquid fuels
Today, liquid fuels â€” gasoline, diesel, and more rare variants like jet fuel â€” are made by refining hydrocarbons drilled from underground. They can be made with carbon from the air instead.
â€œSynthetic fuelsâ€ can be made in many different ways, through many different processes and chemistries, resulting in a variety of fuels. There are synthetic fuels that can substitute for any liquid fuel.
The simplest way to think about them is as a mix of three things: a carbon-based molecule (usually CO2), hydrogen, and energy. The energy is used to pry the oxygen off the carbon and stick the carbon onto the hydrogen. Thus â€œhydrocarbons.â€
The carbon intensity of the resulting fuels depends on the source of all three components: the CO2, the electricity, and the hydrogen.
If the CO2 comes from underground deposits, the electricity comes from fossil fuels, and the hydrogen comes from steam reforming of natural gas (as roughly 95 percent of hydrogen does today), the resulting fuel is extremely carbon intensive.
If the CO2 comes from the ambient air, the electricity comes from renewables, and the hydrogen comes from solar-powered electrolysis (which pulls hydrogen directly out of water), the resulting fuel is extremely low carbon.
Carbon-neutral liquid fuels are almost certainly the largest potential market for CO2. There are lots of liquid fuels in the world, and there are existing markets for cleaner alternatives, including in states like California and Oregon with a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS).
Hydrogen storage. HyTech Power
Reducing the cost of carbon capture would help with synthetic fuels, but itâ€™s the other two ingredients, hydrogen and energy, that represent a larger portion of the costs. It takes a lot of energy to electrolyze hydrogen and it takes even more to pry CO2 apart. (CO2 is tightly bonded; it doesnâ€™t want to come apart.) All that energy costs money.
Extremely cheap renewable energy is the key to making carbon-neutral synthetic fuels work because it is the key to cheap hydrogen, and producing synthetic fuels at scale is going to require a lot of hydrogen. In a special report on difficult-to-decarbonize sectors like industry and air travel, the Energy Transitions Commission emphasized the need for synthetic fuels, and thus the need for hydrogen: â€œAchieving a net-zero-CO2-emissions economy will require an increase in global hydrogen production from 60 [megatons] per annum today to something like 425-650 Mt by mid-century.â€
Even if hydrogen doesnâ€™t play a big direct role in transportation (it probably wonâ€™t), it will still be needed for synthetic fuels, which are themselves needed to decarbonize hard-to-reach sectors like industry. To make electrolysis of â€œgreen hydrogenâ€ possible, renewable energy needs to get real cheap.
There are plenty of analysts who think that utility-scale solar power in good locations will be producing the cheapest electricity in the world soon, down to $20 or even $10 per megawatt-hour. And there will be periods of surplus solar energy that need to be soaked up, energy that might otherwise have gone wasted.
â€œAlthough the production of more complex hydrocarbons is energetically and therefore economically expensive,â€ says the Nature paper, â€œrapid cost-reductions could potentially occur if renewable energyâ€”which represents a large proportion of total costâ€”continues to become cheaper, and if policy stimulates other cost reductions.â€
Synthetic fuels effectively donâ€™t exist today on any kind of market scale (â€œcurrent flows are near-zero,â€ as the Nature paper says), but if everything comes together to support them, they could conceivably capture a substantial chunk of the global fuels market, which is no small thing. Itâ€™s not CO2s, but itâ€™s a whole lot of CO2Ï.
To be clear: the future is electrification. When it comes to decarbonization, it is always better to electrify the end uses of energy â€” to use the electricity directly, rather than losing a large fraction of it to conversions â€” but even under optimistic scenarios, there are going to be sectors that are difficult to electrify.
Carbon-neutral liquid fuels for sectors that are difficult to decarbonize are both a large market and a key piece of the decarbonization puzzle.

3. Chemicals and plastics
Using various catalysts, CO2 can be made into a variety of chemical intermediaries â€” materials that then serve as feedstocks in other industrial processes, like methanol, syngas, and formic acid.
CO2 can also be transformed by catalysts into polymers, the precursors for plastics, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals. For now, CO2 derived polymers are quite expensive, but plastics are another potentially substantial market â€” they represent a growing fraction of demand for liquid fossil fuels. And they have a lifespan of decades to centuries, so they present some potential for CO2s.
Currently, only a few chemical applications of CO2 are commercialized at scale, including the production of urea and polycarbonate polyols.
4. Algae
Captured CO2 can be used to accelerate the growth of algae, which has the capacity to absorb much more of it, much faster, than any other source of biomass. And algae is uniquely useful. It can serve as feedstock for food, biofuels, plastics, and even carbon fiber (see No. 5). Itâ€™s worth noting that around five years ago, algae was seen as a kind of wonder-plant, but the sector hasnâ€™t really taken off and a lot of the early companies have gone under.
5. Novel materials
Hereâ€™s where we find more speculative, cutting edge, but potentially momentous markets. CO2 can be be made into high-performance materials â€” carbon composites, carbon fiber, graphene â€” that could conceivably substitute for a whole range of materials, from metals to concrete.
For instance, the team at C2CNT is using â€œmolten electrolysisâ€ to transform CO2 directly into carbon nanotubes, which are stronger than steel and highly conductive. They are already used in high-end applications like the Boeing Dreamliner and some sports cars. But as they become cheaper, there is almost no ceiling to the market.
To take just one example, think of substituting carbon nanotubes for copper in electricity wiring. (Thanks to Adam Siegel for pointing out this idea.) Virtually every application of electricity, from the space station to electric vehicles to household appliances, would benefit from lighter-weight wiring that conducts better.
And then thereâ€™s steel, the most commonly used metal in the world, responsible for between 7 and 9 percent of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. If carbon-based materials could be substituted for steel on any real scale, it could mean billions of tons of reduced emissions, not to mention effectively permanent carbon sequestration.
Of course, this kind of materials research is still in its early stages and will take some technological breakthroughs to bring down costs enough to begin displacing other materials at scale. For now, carbon materials are getting a foothold in boutique markets.
Comparing CCU technologies on cost and potential
The Nature paper compared 10 different CCU pathways, including the natural ones, which Iâ€™ve excluded here, and EOR, which I covered in my last post. So the chart below contains some extraneous information for our purposes. Nonetheless, itâ€™s worth examining closely, as it shows the pathways by costs, potential for CO2 use, and by technological readiness (TRL). There are two scenarios, reflecting the low end and high end of projections.
Nature
Zero on the vertical axis is the present day â€œbreakeven costâ€ (in 2015 dollars), the point at which a technology is competitive with incumbents. Those below that line are already competitive. Those above the line would need a commensurate subsidy of some kind to compete.
The width of the bars indicate the amount of CO2 the technology could utilize annually by 2050 (based on projections and expert opinion). And the color of a bar indicates its TRL.
Based on the optimistic high scenario, a few of the chemical pathways (polyol, urea, and methanol) are already cost-competitive, though their potential for CO2 use is relatively small, close to a gigaton cumulatively.
The concrete pathways (aggregates and curing) are fairly close to cost-competitive and curing in particular has fairly large potential, especially when you consider that its CO2 counts twice, once as emission reductions, once as permanent storage.
Troublingly, the industrial CCU technology pathways with the most total potential to use CO2 are the most expensive relative to incumbents.
Together, synthetic liquid fuels (methanol, methane, dimethyl ether, and Fischerâ€“Tropsch fuels) could use over 4 gigatons of CO2 a year by 2050. (By way of comparison, global CO2 emissions in 2018 were about 37 gigatons.) But they currently need something like a $500 per ton of CO2 subsidy to compete.
Nevertheless, as the Nature paper says, â€œmany technologies are in the very early stages of development, and cost optimization via research and development could substantially change these estimates.â€ If thereâ€™s one target for concerted R&D that seems obvious, itâ€™s synthetic fuels.
Hereâ€™s the same information in table form, if thatâ€™s your thing:
Nature
One thing the table makes clear is that the ranges on some of these projections are extremely wide ($0 to $670?), reflecting the enormous degree of uncertainty involved.
How these CCU technologies develop will depend on the price curve of renewable energy, the price curve of green hydrogen, developments in a range of markets, and the level of R&D and policy support they receive from lawmakers. All those are individually difficult to predict; sussing out how they might interact through 2050 is a game of educated guessing.
CCU can do more if thereâ€™s policy to support it
The Nature paperâ€™s conclusions reflect the average of a huge number of studies and experts, attempting to determine current costs and what will happen.
But itâ€™s worth taking at least a quick glance at some more optimistic estimates of what could happen with supportive policy.
In 2016, the Global CO2 Initiative commissioned a comprehensive roadmap for CCU from Lux Research. It not only projected how CCU technologies might scale under business as usual, but also how they might scale if the policy recommendations in the roadmap are followed.
Hereâ€™s how the roadmap assesses the CO reduction potential of various CCU technologies:
GCI
As you can see, following the â€œstrategic actionsâ€ recommended by the report could radically expand the CO2 absorption potential of both aggregates and synthetic fuels. The roadmap estimates that, at the upper bound, â€œover 10% of annual [global] CO2 emissions can be captured in these products.â€
Hereâ€™s the total revenue potential of the CCU markets:
Again, fuels and aggregates show enormous potential, growing ten- or twenty-fold more under good policy. The roadmap estimates that overall, annual revenue of the combined markets could hit between $800 billion and $1.1 trillion by 2030.
As I said, all of these are tenuous estimates, but still, if CCU technologies could potentially develop into a $1 trillion-plus business that cuts global emissions by 10 percent, they seem worth serious investment of attention and resources. The more we can use, the less we will emit.
How should policymakers approach CCU technologies? Whatâ€™s the right way to support them and, more broadly, the right way to think about them in the context of the larger climate fight? I will address those questions in my next post."
"Microtargeting is a powerful advertising tool that allows politicians such as President Donald Trump to aim ads at specific groups of people, or even individuals, online. The advertising tech has become increasingly controversial, with critics saying it permits politicians to target very narrow groups of voters with tailored messages that have the potential to manipulate the political debate.
Now, two major tech companies, Google and Twitter, have overhauled their political ads policies and severely limited campaignsâ€™ ability to target voters â€” and Facebook is under mounting pressure to do the same.
It all fits into an even bigger debate over whether restricting political ads online could do enough to curtail the type of election interference and misinformation campaigns that played out during the 2016 presidential election. Limiting how narrowly a campaign can target voters, or what kinds of ads politicians can pay for, may solve a few problems, but some say tech companiesâ€™ real concern should be moderating the misleading and extremist organic (that means unpaid) content that clogs their platforms.
Hereâ€™s the state of play: In October, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced that his company would ban political ads from its platform. However, it will still allow issue ads, which means that while Elizabeth Warren canâ€™t advertise her bid for the presidency, a political group can still buy ads urging people to vote to protect the environment. Twitter is limiting microtargeting for these issue ads, which will allow advertisers to target at the state level in the US, but they canâ€™t use zip codes, and they canâ€™t use keywords or interest targeting around politics (such as terms like conservative or liberal) to find their targets.

Then last week, Google said it would restrict advertisersâ€™ ability to microtarget political ads across its products, such as Search and YouTube. As of January 6, political advertisers will still be able to target people using age, gender, and zip code, but they wonâ€™t be able to get as granular with specific voters and groups as they used to.
Twitter and Googleâ€™s moves are especially significant because they put pressure on the platform that kicked off much of the recent debate around political advertising in the first place: Facebook. The company came under fire this fall over its policy of allowing politicians to lie in ads. Initially, CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a hard line on the matter and said Facebook wouldnâ€™t back down. Now, weeks later, the company is in fact considering making some changes to its policy, including how much microtargeting it allows.
The changes (or in Facebookâ€™s case, potential changes) have gotten a mixed response from politicians, advertisers, pundits, and the public. Given all the chatter about political ads, Twitter and Google doing something has been generally well received by voters. But thereâ€™s hardly a consensus on whether these are the right moves, or whether weâ€™re even having the right conversation.
Microtargeting and how political campaigns use it to advertise, briefly explained
Twitterâ€™s decision, while sure to stir up some controversy, isnâ€™t a huge deal for politicians or for Twitter â€” itâ€™s a relatively small player within the political online advertising space, and political ads donâ€™t make up a big portion of its revenue. Google and Facebook, however, are much bigger deals, so Iâ€™ll focus on those.
One of the most important features Google is nixing is â€œCustomer Match,â€ which allows campaigns to match peopleâ€™s online profiles with the voter data they have and target them specifically. On Facebook, a similar tool is called â€œCustom Audiences.â€
Hereâ€™s how it works: Political campaigns create databases about voters that include information about whether a person is registered to vote, how often they vote, their party affiliation, their mailing address, their email address, and their phone number. They can then upload those voter files to Google and Facebook to find those peopleâ€™s online profiles, and then advertise specifically to them. Google is now banning political campaigns from doing this. So politicians will no longer be able to serve an ad to me, Emily Stewart, specifically. But they can still advertise to women like me, ages 25-35, in Brooklyn, New York.
â€œIf a campaign knows where the people theyâ€™re trying to target live, then they can still target them on Google,â€ said Alan Rosenblatt, a director at progressive strategy group Unfiltered.Media. â€œThat said, it isnâ€™t as precise, and as a result, youâ€™ll have to buy more Google ads to reach the people you want as frequently as you want.â€
Googleâ€™s move puts further pressure on Facebook to change something when it comes to its political ads policies, but itâ€™s not clear what the company will decide. Facebookâ€™s vice president of global marketing solutions, Carolyn Everson, told Recodeâ€™s Peter Kafka last week that the company was not considering targeting â€” but then quickly walked that back. The Wall Street Journal later reported that Facebook is considering increasing the minimum number of people a political ad can target on its platform from 100 to a few thousand â€” but at this point, Facebook still hasnâ€™t made any changes, so anything could be on the table.
Some strategists and politicians think this is great
Reactions to Googleâ€™s microtargeting decision and speculation Facebook might soon follow suit have been all over the place.
Proponents of limiting campaign microtargeting say this is a good way to root out some of the bad actors and bad practices in online political ads. It will make it harder to target negative and fake ads so precisely, so if a shady ad is out there, more people are likelier to see it, and that means political opponents and other groups will have a better ability to counter it. For example, in 2016, the Trump campaign targeted infrequent black voters with ads showing Hillary Clinton in 1996 calling some young black males â€œsuper predators.â€ It was a voter suppression effort aimed at getting those voters to stay home, and limiting microtargeting would make such an effort more difficult to execute in such a precise way.
Proponents of Googleâ€™s move also note that voters often donâ€™t know theyâ€™re being targeted with an ad campaign. In a statement following Googleâ€™s announcement about ad targeting, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) noted that the transparency features Facebook has around advertisements donâ€™t apply to its custom audiences feature, for example. â€œTargeted influence campaigns are more effective and more cost-effective than blanket propaganda, and far harder to identify and expose,â€ he said.
Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission, in a series of tweets applauded Googleâ€™s decision and challenged Facebook to follow it. However, she warned that zip code-level targeting might still be too narrow. â€œThe public may not be able to adequately hear and respond to communication targeted down to that geographic level,â€ she said.
Chris Nolan, the founder of political advertising and analytics agency Spot-On, told Recode that Googleâ€™s decision â€œchanges the conversation about political advertisingâ€ in that it acknowledges the velocity of online advertising and how precise it can be in comparison to broadcast ads. â€œThe largest player in the ad technology business has said that political ads shouldnâ€™t be treated the same as brand advertising, and that is a big deal,â€ she said. â€œBut the question remains, are other players going to follow along?â€
And those other players are not just Facebook, but also other platforms that facilitate digital ads, such as SpotX and Adobe.
Others are not so happy with this
Of course, not everyone has been thrilled with Google limiting microtargeting â€” or the prospect of Facebook doing so. They argue that focusing on microtargeting is misguided, and that it could undermine up-and-coming campaigns that canâ€™t afford television ads but that can run online ads with a small budget.
Tara McGowan, the founder of Acronym, a progressive strategy group that is currently raising $75 million to counter the Trump campaignâ€™s digital ads, said in a statement to Recode that Googleâ€™s decision wonâ€™t curb disinformation but instead will â€œhinder campaigns and others who are already working against the tide of bad actors to reach voters with facts.â€ She said the decision affects Googleâ€™s ad inventory as well as inventory across the internet. â€œThey are essentially using their market power to limit how campaigns can speak to voters where they get their information,â€ she said.
Progressive digital network Blue Digital Exchange warned in a Medium post signed by dozens of operatives and strategists that limiting microtargeting will ultimately harm Democrats more than it does Republicans because the Republican voter base is more homogenous and therefore easier to reach with limited targeting. â€œWithout using voter registration files, a Republican campaign can advertise to this homogenous group of people and expect to engage a majority of registered voters. In contrast, a Democratic campaign advertising to young, urban, people of color might have to spend a lot more because they are trying to reach a fraction of users within that group who are actually eligible to vote,â€ they wrote.
But Trumpâ€™s campaign is also displeased with Googleâ€™s decision. His campaign manager, Brad Parscale, slammed the policy change, and Trumpâ€™s campaign and other Republican leadership groups put out a joint statement saying the changes Google is making are an attempt to suppress voter turnout. (Thereâ€™s no evidence that is true.)
The Trump camp has also been sending out warnings to voters about Facebook potentially limiting microtargeting. Itâ€™s true that limiting microtargeting would probably slow down the advantage that a big, well-funded campaign has in placing hundreds of microtargeted ads that are impossible to track. But itâ€™s also true that those in Trumpâ€™s orbit are eager to jump at any opportunity to take a swipe at big tech companies and accuse them of anti-conservative bias.
Jesse Blumenthal, vice president of technology and innovation at Stand Together, a network of Koch-funded nonprofits, told Recode that beyond the ins and outs of microtargeting policies, itâ€™s a question of free speech. â€œImplicitly, what is being said is political speech is less valuable than other forms of speech and that these companies ought to be the ones moderating political speech,â€ he said.
Of course, it is the government that owes Americans free speech and is bound by the First Amendment not to infringe on their rights. The law doesnâ€™t apply in the same way to Twitter, Facebook, and Google, so they can police their platforms however they want.
Google, Facebook, and Twitter would rather talk about political ads than a lot of other issues on their platforms
All the chatter about political advertising and microtargeting distracts from much bigger and more complicated problems for tech companies to deal with: namely, the organic content that often spreads disinformation and inflammatory, violent, and abusive content across their platforms.
When Google is talking about political microtargeting, what itâ€™s not talking about is how YouTubeâ€™s recommended and autoplay features push people toward more radicalized and extremist content. While weâ€™re debating whether or not Facebook should permit politicians to lie in ads, what weâ€™re not discussing is how fake news, memes, and disinformation spread organically on the platform. Twitter is banning political ads, but it has a much bigger challenge in addressing how the platform is used to spread hate, the presidentâ€™s use of his Twitter account, and the abuse and harassment that happens on its platform every day.
â€œInstead of monitoring and taking responsibility for the spread of misinformation on their platforms, Google has chosen to pursue a disingenuous and frankly dangerous shift in their policies so they can claim publicly to be serious about the problem,â€ McGowan said.
Thereâ€™s still a lot of anxiety about the 2016 election and the roles of disinformation, foreign interference, and tech on politics and democracy around the world. Microtargeting has always existed (just look at mailed advertising campaigns), but obviously the internet amplifies it. Focusing on digital political ads is a way to address one problem, but itâ€™s not the same as dealing with the broader question of the role of Big Tech in shaping the future of political discourse and democracy."
"The investigation into Rudy Giuliani and his associates by the US Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) is heating up, according to a set of new reports â€” and new details suggest prosecutors are looking into matters near the heart of the Ukraine scandal.
The new reports cite subpoenas sent out to various associates of President Trumpâ€™s personal attorney by SDNY. The subpoenas reveal that prosecutors are looking into Giulianiâ€™s business and finances, that theyâ€™re exploring his contacts with former top Ukrainian officials, and that theyâ€™re investigating a host of potential crimes.
Back in October, two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted for campaign finance violations. Parnas and Fruman had already gained notoriety in the media for helping Giuliani make connections with Ukrainian officials who claimed to know of scandalous information that could be helpful to Trump. And their arrest happened in the midst of Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry on that very topic.
The charges against Parnas and Fruman did not mention Giuliani; the pair were apparently charged in some haste, to prevent them from leaving the country. But word soon leaked out that Giuliani was under scrutiny by SDNY as well.
Overall, things donâ€™t look great for Giuliani, who says he has not even been contacted by investigators. Generally, if investigators are reaching out to lots of your associates but not to you, it may mean that youâ€™re the investigationâ€™s target. But, though details are still scant on the overall probe, hereâ€™s what weâ€™ve learned about it lately.
Prosecutors are investigating a lot of potential crimes
The Wall Street Journalâ€™s Rebecca Davis Oâ€™Brien, Rebecca Ballhaus, and Shelby Holliday had the first major story on the Giuliani associate subpoenas this week. They reported that the subpoenas theyâ€™d heard about â€œlisted more than a half dozen potential charges under consideration.â€ These were:
Obstruction of justice
Money laundering
Conspiracy to defraud the United States
Making false statements to the federal government
Serving as agent of a foreign government without registering
Donating funds from foreign nationals
Making contributions in the name of another person or allowing someone else to use oneâ€™s name
Mail fraud
Wire fraud
Thatâ€™s ... a lot. Many of these potential crimes relate to foreign influence â€” either about unregistered foreign lobbying or getting foreign money into the campaign finance system. Others are more typical crimes, such as obstruction and fraud.
And, of course, thereâ€™s the money.
Prosecutors want information on Giulianiâ€™s money and business
According to Reutersâ€™ Aram Roston, who quoted the exact text of one subpoena (given to a person or entity remaining anonymous), prosecutors are following the money â€” Giulianiâ€™s money. This subpoena requests:
â€œAll documents, including correspondence, with or related to Rudolph Giuliani, Giuliani Partners, or any related person or entityâ€
All â€œdocuments related to any actual or potential payments, or agreements to or with Giulianiâ€
Giuliani has said his legal work for Trump is unpaid. However, he has landed numerous wealthy foreign clients for both his legal work and his consulting firm Giuliani Partners.
One set of payments to Giuliani is particularly relevant to this scandal: In the fall of 2018, Parnas and Fruman agreed to pay him $500,000. They then started working closely together on matters related to Ukraine. There was much speculation about where Parnas and Fruman came up with this money, but according to the New York Times, they got a Republican donor from Long Island, Charles Gucciardo, to foot the bill. Still, prosecutors certainly seem interested in where Giulianiâ€™s money is coming from.
Prosecutors want information on contacts with key Ukrainian officials
Meanwhile, the Washington Postâ€™s Devlin Barrett, Tom Hamburger, Rosalind Helderman, and Josh Dawsey have learned about another notable aspect of the investigation: an interest in top Ukrainian officials.
â€œOne person with knowledge of the investigation said there is a particular interest in interactions with three key figures in the saga of Giulianiâ€™s pursuit of dirt on Biden and his son Hunter: Poroshenko and former Ukrainian prosecutors Yuri Lutsenko and Viktor Shokin,â€ the Post reporters write.
That would be:
Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine from 2014 until earlier this year, when Volodymyr Zelensky defeated him in an election
Viktor Shokin, who was Poroshenkoâ€™s prosecutor general until he was ousted under US and international pressure due to alleged corruption in 2016
Yuri Lutsenko, who succeeded Shokin as prosecutor general until this year, when Zelensky replaced him with his own choice for the post
Shokin and Lutsenko have both been involved in Trump alliesâ€™ effort to drum up dirt on the Bidens.
Shokin has claimed Vice President Joe Biden pushed for his ouster because Shokin was investigating Burisma, a gas company Bidenâ€™s son Hunter sat on the board of. But US officials like George Kent have testified that Shokin himself was extremely corrupt and ineffective as prosecutor general, and thatâ€™s the reason he was ousted. No evidence has surfaced of improper motives on Bidenâ€™s part.
Lutsenko, meanwhile, helped get the Biden allegations media coverage by talking about them to conservative journalist John Solomon earlier this year. He also combined them with his own (baseless and eventually retracted) allegations against the US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.
Lutsenko is reportedly referenced, though not by name, in SDNYâ€™s indictment of Parnas and Fruman, which accuses the pair of seeking to advance â€œthe political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.â€ According to NBC Newsâ€™ Tom Winter, Dan De Lue, and Anna Schecter, that official is Lutsenko â€” and his â€œpolitical interestsâ€ involve the ouster of Ambassador Yovanovitch.
Poroshenko meanwhile, hasnâ€™t seemed as deeply involved in the dirt-digging, but both the Journal and the Post have reported that, when he was still president earlier this year, Parnas and Fruman pressed him to announce an investigation into Hunter Biden.

Prosecutors want materials on the main pro-Trump Super PAC
Finally, again according to the Wall Street Journalâ€™s Oâ€™Brien, Ballhaus, and Holliday, subpoenas also â€œsought materials related to America First Action and America First Policies, two pro-Trump groups.â€
America First Action is the main pro-Trump Super PAC, which was founded to help Republicans in the 2018 midterms, and America First Policies is its affiliated nonprofit arm.
Prosecutorsâ€™ interest in these groups is not exactly a surprise, since Parnas and Fruman were charged with making false disclosures regarding $325,000 they gave to America First Action in 2018. But itâ€™s another reminder that this probe is delving into Trumpâ€™s political circle.
Overall, regardless of the outcome of the impeachment inquiry, it appears that Giuliani, Parnas, and Fruman will remain in legal jeopardy for some time. Parnas, for his part, appears to have broken with Trump and Giuliani and is trying to get some sort of immunity in exchange for testifying to Congress â€” but itâ€™s unclear whether that will happen."

"The United Nations reported this week that the world is continuing to drift further off course in limiting climate change, despite growing alarm about the impacts of rising temperatures. With greenhouse gas emissions continuing to increase, even more drastic reductions are needed to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement.
â€œAny further delay brings the need for larger, more expensive and unlikely cuts,â€ wrote Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme in the Emissions Gap Report 2019. â€œWe need quick wins, or the 1.5Â°C goal of the Paris Agreement will slip out of reach.â€
And the impacts of climate change are already here. Climate scientists told us late last year in the National Climate Assessment that the United States is already experiencing the severe and costly consequences of a changing climate. In a separate United Nations report released in October, scientists reported that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require a gargantuan global effort to halve emissions â€” and that we have roughly 12 years to do it. But how?
Letâ€™s make something clear: The emissions we need to focus on now are the ones at the industrial, corporate level.
According to the Carbon Majors Database, 71 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 can be traced back to just 100 fossil fuel companies. Hitting the 1.5Â°C or 2Â°C goals means these corporations, their customers, and other large enterprises must phase out fossil fuels (more aggressively than what Shell laid out in its vision for a zero-carbon world).
Governments will also have to come up with tax schemes to generate new revenue for investment in and incentives for renewable energy, reforestation, and carbon removal technologies. And we need to vote for leaders who will deliver on them.
America is warming fast. See how your cityâ€™s weather will be different by 2050.
The Trump administration is obviously contributing little to these efforts, trying its best to roll back Obamaâ€™s suite of climate policies and enable the continuation of fossil fuel dominance. But a growing number of younger leaders around the world understand whatâ€™s at stake and are pushing for more ambitious goals, like the ones outlined in the Green New Deal.
Here are some examples of strategies that are working and need to be rolled out worldwide:
1) Price carbon emissions
By adding a cost to emitting greenhouse gases, you create an incentive to produce less of them and switch to alternatives.
Itâ€™s hard to convince someone to pay for something if they can get it for free. Right now, much of the world can dump their greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at no charge. And we donâ€™t have many straightforward ways to value the carbon that trees and algae help pull out of the atmosphere.
Though the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report didnâ€™t explicitly discuss the economics of fighting climate change, the authors highlighted at a press conference that attaching a price tag to greenhouse gases is a critical step in limiting warming. â€œCarbon pricing and the right economic signals are going to be part of the mix,â€ said Jim Skea, co-chair of IPCC Working Group III.
Even fossil fuel giant ExxonMobil is campaigning for a carbon tax.
To date, at least 40 countries have priced carbon in some form. Some have done it through a carbon tax. Cap-and-trade schemes for carbon dioxide are also underway, like the European Unionâ€™s Emissions Trading System. China now runs the worldâ€™s largest carbon trading market. Even some regions in the United States have cap-and-trade schemes, like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative among eastern states.
But, as our colleague David Roberts wrote on Twitter, â€œA price on carbon of some sort is, wonks almost universally agree, an important part of a comprehensive climate strategy. But the details make all the difference in whether itâ€™s regressive or not, effective or not, popular or not, passable or not.â€

2) Subsidize clean energy, and end subsidies for dirty energy
Renewable energy sources like wind and solar power have already become dramatically more affordable. In the United States, renewables are cost-competitive with fossil fuels in some markets. In Europe, new unsubsidized renewable energy projects are coming online.
From a market standpoint, it might seem like the time is near for pulling the plug on subsidies to renewables. But if your goal is to fight climate change, it makes more sense to keep giving cleaner energy sources a boost.
The fossil fuel industry is meanwhile still getting a number of direct and indirect subsidies. In the US, these subsidies can amount to $20 billion a year. Globally, itâ€™s about $5.2 trillion per year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Getting rid of government support for these fuels seems like a no-brainer. But yes, the massive political influence of fossil fuels means this will continue to be extremely hard.
3) Close coal plants, and cut off the fossil fuel supply in other ways
The world is still opening tens of thousands of megawatts of coal-fired power capacity every year.
Each of these plants represents decades of further greenhouse gas emissions. Although the rate of new coal power plants is declining, thatâ€™s not enough. We still need to shut down the oldest, dirtiest coal power plants and prevent new ones from coming online.

I work in the environmental movement. I donâ€™t care if you recycle.
According to the IPCC, to stay on track for climate goals, global coal consumption would have to decline by two-thirds by 2030.
And while natural gas emits about half the greenhouse gases of coal, the quantity isnâ€™t zero, so these generators are in the cross-hairs too.
Some countries are already taking steps to shut off fossil fuel power. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has assembled a panel to figure out when the country can close all of its coal plants. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, has pledged to end its coal use by 2025.
Economists have also argued that countries should use supply-side tactics to restrict the supply of fossil fuels in other ways, too: like opting against new oil and gas pipelines, refineries, and export terminals.
4) Electrify everything and get more efficient
Energy efficiency is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit in fighting climate change.
Increasing fuel economy, insulating buildings, and upgrading lighting are all small incremental changes that add up to dramatic reductions in energy use, curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
Itâ€™s also often the cheapest tactic.
â€œThe combined evidence suggests that aggressive policies addressing energy efficiency are central in keeping 1.5Â°C within reach and lowering energy system and mitigation costs,â€ according to the new IPCC report.
Buildings, for example, account for roughly one-third of global energy use and about a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions. To stay on track for 1.5Â°C of warming, indoor heating and cooling demands would have to decline by at least one-third by 2050.
Many countries already have building codes that require new structures to use state-of-the-art HVAC systems, double-pane glass windows, and energy-saving appliances. But most of the buildings that are standing now will still exist in 2050, so retrofitting existing homes and offices to use less energy needs to be a major policy priority.
Another way to use our resources more efficiently is to electrify everything: oil heaters, diesel trucks, gas stoves. That way, as our sources of electricity get cleaner, they pay climate dividends throughout the rest of the electrified economy. And products like electric cars are far more energy-efficient than their gasoline-powered counterparts.
However, we need financing, incentives, and penalties to push the global economy to do more with less.
5) Invest in innovation
Perhaps the best tools to fight climate change havenâ€™t been invented yet â€” a battery that can store gobs of energy for months, a solar panel thatâ€™s twice as efficient, a crop that makes biofuels cheaper than petroleum, or something even better, beyond our imaginations.
So while we clamp down on heavy emitters and deploy cleaner alternatives, we also need to come up with new answers to climate change.
That means investing in basic research and development. It also means helping nascent technologies get out of the laboratory and onto the power grid, whether through loans, grants, or regulations.
The United States already has a framework for this. The Department of Energy runs the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), a small federal program that funds high-risk, high-reward energy projects with an eye toward fighting climate change. Itâ€™s backed projects ranging from flow batteries to wide bandgap semiconductors.
While analysts have argued that programs like ARPA-E increase Americaâ€™s competitiveness and that the world needs more innovation initiatives for clean energy, the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to zero out its $353 million budget. Congress has nonetheless kept it in place and gave the program a boost in the last spending bill.

6) End production and sales of cars, trucks, and buses that run on fossil fuels
Within a few decades, we are likely to see a worldwide transition away from vehicles that run on gas toward ones that use electricity.
But thereâ€™s a lot of uncertainty about how quickly it will happen. And governments have to hurry it along by phasing out the production and sale of gas and diesel vehicles altogether and helping consumers purchase EVs instead.
Fortunately, thereâ€™s a lot of momentum building. In 2017, both China and India, along with a few European countries, announced plans to end sales of gas and diesel vehicles. China is hustling toward that goal by providing incentives to manufacturers of electric car and bus makers, as well as subsidies to consumers who purchase EVs to the tune of $10,000 per vehicle on average.
The US is lagging, as per usual, despite the fact our transportation sector today emits more carbon than any other sector of the economy. California, however, is going full speed ahead on EV policy. Its target is 5 million zero-emissions vehicles by 2030 and 250,000 zero-emission vehicle chargers â€” including 10,000 DC fast chargers â€” by 2025.

7) Require â€œzero deforestationâ€ supply chains
Tropical forests in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Central Africa are essential for keeping carbon in the ground and maintaining the climate.
And the current rate that weâ€™re clearing them â€” to make way for cattle ranches, as well as palm oil, soy, and wood products â€” is putting us on a course for rapid climate change, with intensifying cycles of extreme droughts, more heat, and more forest fires.
All told, deforestation accounts for an estimated 15 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.
Halting deforestation canâ€™t be done from afar; it requires working closely with local communities who live in and rely on forests. But governments and corporations can also be pressured to buy commodities only from forest regions certified as â€œdeforestation-free.â€
Norway, for instance, now has a â€œzero deforestation policy,â€ where it has committed to ensuring â€œthat public procurements do not contribute to deforestation of the rainforest.â€ Hundreds of companies have made zero-deforestation commitments, too, but we still have a long way to go before theyâ€™re airtight and working.
If we could stop deforestation, restore some of the forests weâ€™ve cut down, and improve forestry practices, we could remove 7 billion metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere annually â€” equal to eliminating 1.5 billion cars, according to the Climate and Land Use Alliance.
8) Keep aging nuclear plants running
Nuclear power currently is responsible for about 20 percent of US electricity â€” and 50 percent of its carbon-free electricity. As Voxâ€™s David Roberts has noted, the US could lose a lot of this power if some 15 to 20 nuclear plants at risk of closing shut down in the next five to 10 years. Which means that, â€œsaving it, or at least as much of it as possible, seems like an obvious and urgent priority for anyone who values decarbonization.â€
Fortunately, Dave also looked at how we could keep these plants open. Near the top of the list is a relatively modest national carbon price (see No. 1 above).
But since we canâ€™t count on a carbon price in the immediate future, itâ€™s worth looking at the other state-level hacks â€” like zero emissions credits, paid for by a small tariff on power bills â€” already being deployed to keep nuclear plants running.
Other countries are also wrestling with the future of their nuclear plants. Germany committed to shutting down all of its nuclear reactors by 2022, but the country is now likely to miss its emissions reduction targets. France is now weighing whether to extend the operating life of some of its aging nuclear power plants.
9) Discourage meat and dairy consumption, encourage plant-based diets
Producing animal products, particularly beef and dairy, creates the majority of food-related greenhouse emissions, while the food supply chain overall creates 26 percent of total emissions. The most obvious way to bring these emissions down would be to engineer a massive shift in dietary patterns, reducing our meat and dairy consumption and shrinking the livestock sector.
â€œGHG emissions cannot be sufficiently mitigated without dietary changes towards more plant-based diets,â€ as Marco Springmann of the Oxford Martin Program on the Future of Food and co-authors wrote in a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
But again, this is not so much about individual choices. This is about asking our leaders, institutions, and employers to make dietary change a priority to truly shift markets and lower emissions. Trouble is, no country has had significant success yet with reducing its meat consumption. And as Springmann and his co-authors note, â€œproviding information without additional economic or environmental changes has a limited influence on behavior.â€
The kinds of changes we need, they write, include â€œmedia and education campaigns; labeling and consumer information; fiscal measures, such as taxation, subsidies, and other economic incentives; school and workplace approaches; local environmental changes; and direct restriction and mandates.â€
Itâ€™s that last one, â€œdirect restriction and mandates,â€ thatâ€™s most interesting, most daring, and most essential to try immediately.
Some countries like China are beginning to work meat consumption reduction goals into their dietary guidelines. The US should do that too in its next update in 2020. Thereâ€™s also the Cool Food Pledge, a platform launched in September by the World Resources Institute, to help food service providers slash food-related emissions by 25 percent by 2030. So far, a few companies and institutions have signed up, including Morgan Stanley, UC Davis Medical Center, and Genentech.
Companies and governments could also follow WeWorkâ€™s lead and stop serving or paying for meat at company events.
We need many more experiments like this. We still have no idea how to go about dietary change on the scale thatâ€™s necessary to reduce livestock-related emissions.
10) Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Every scenario outlined by the IPCC report counts on pulling carbon dioxide out of the air. However, many of technologies needed to do this are in their infancy.
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) tactics range from the straightforward (like planting forests) to the novel (like scrubbing carbon dioxide straight from the air).
Governments will need to invest more in CDR technology to improve its effectiveness and bring down costs. Policies like renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and investment tax credits can help drive the deployment of CDR, as Julio Friedmann, a researcher at Columbia University who studies carbon capture, noted in recently in The Hill. But the biggest thing CDR companies need to blossom is a price on carbon.

The simple argument for keeping nuclear power plants open"
"The ongoing impeachment process in the House is naturally bringing to mind other times Congress has weighed removing a president for impeding justice. There were the impeachments of Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, of course, but perhaps the most obvious analogue is the one president who resigned before Congress could kick him out: Richard Nixon.
So what did Nixon do exactly that made Watergate so infamous â€” and how did the scandal itself come about?
Everyone knows that Watergate had something to do with a break-in at the Watergate building in Washington, DC. But it's not really the break-in itself that ended Richard Nixon's presidency so much as the fact that the ensuing investigation revealed a tangled web of wrongdoing of almost unfathomable scale and complexity, implicating the highest levels of the White House up to and including the president.
Veteran journalist Elizabeth Drew covered Watergate in real time, and her excellent book on that period â€” Washington Journal: Reporting Watergate and Richard Nixon's Downfall â€” was recently reissued. In 2014, near the 40th anniversary of the resignation, she helped walk us through the trickier points of the scandal and its aftermath. Tim Naftali, the former director of the Nixon Library and current director of the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives at New York University, was also enormously helpful.
1) What was the Watergate break-in?
James McCord testifies before the Senate Watergate Committee. Keystone/Getty Images
On June 17, 1972, five men were caught attempting to bug the Democratic National Committee's offices in the Watergate, a residential/office complex in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of DC.
Three of them were Cuban by background, a fourth was an American who had participated in the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, and the fifth was a former CIA employee. They were found with two listening devices, and two ceiling panels in an office adjacent to that of DNC chair Lawrence O'Brien were removed, suggesting that the burglars were attempting to bug O'Brien's office.
Alfred Cohen, the Washington Post reporter who covered the initial break-in, reported that the suspects were also found with ""lock-picks and door jimmies, almost $2,300 in cash, most of it in $100 bills with the serial numbers in sequence â€¦ one walkie-talkie, a short wave receiver that could pick up police calls, 40 rolls of unexposed film, two 35 millimeter cameras and three pen-sized tear gas guns."" There were two open file drawers in the office when the burglars were caught, presumably because they were attempting to photograph documents.
The break-in â€” the fourth such attempt, Drew says, with one previous break-in succeeding but not accomplishing the mission at hand â€” had been planned by Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy at the behest of the Committee to Reelect the President (CRP), Nixon's campaign committee.
Hunt was a veteran CIA operative who had been involved in the agency's successful plot to overthrow left-leaning Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz and in the catastrophic Bay of Pigs invasion. Liddy was a former FBI agent turned aspiring Republican politician, who became close with the Nixon election team after a failed 1968 congressional run. Both were members of the team known as the White House plumbers â€” but more on that in a minute.
Exactly what the burglars were hoping to find, through either photographing documents or bugging the office, is still somewhat unclear. Hunt insisted they were looking for evidence that the DNC was receiving money from the North Vietnamese or Cuban governments. Liddy has recently claimed the plan was to find information embarrassing to White House counsel John Dean.
Perhaps the most popular theory is that Nixon was worried that O'Brien knew about his financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes, for whom O'Brien served as a lobbyist in addition to his DNC duties. A large loan from Hughes to Nixon's brother had become an issue in the 1960 presidential race (which Nixon lost narrowly), and when Nixon took office in 1969, Hughes reportedly gave him $100,000 (about $650,000 today) by way of the president's friend Charles ""Bebe"" Rebozo, some of which, a 60 Minutes report alleged, went toward Nixon's house in Florida. If that was in fact what the money was used for, it'd be natural for Nixon to fear what O'Brien could do with that knowledge.
There is no smoking gun indicating that Nixon ordered the break-in personally. As Rutgers professor and Nixon expert David Greenberg notes, CRP staff member and Watergate co-conspirator Jeb Magruder claimed to have heard Nixon authorize the break-in, but no hard evidence has turned up to confirm that allegation. However, Nixon certainly created an environment in which criminality was acceptable and even encouraged, and actively participated in covering up the crime.
2) Was the break-in the only crime Nixon's team committed?
White House â€œplumberâ€ Howard Hunt. Michael Brennan/Getty Images
Far from it. Nixon's operatives engaged in a whole bevy of criminal activity, much of it targeted at sabotaging his political opponents. His White House had an investigative unit known as the ""plumbers"" who were tasked with much of this. As White House aide Charles Colson said to Nixon once, ""We did a hell of a lot of things and never got caught.""
One notorious plumber operation involved breaking into the offices of Lewis Fielding, the psychiatrist of Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg, as a government contractor, had contributed to a massive report on the war effort in Vietnam, detailing ways the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses had misled the public about the war, that would come to be known as the Pentagon Papers. He leaked it to the New York Times, the Washington Post, and various senators. Ironically, the break-in led to the dismissal of the espionage charges against Ellsberg, and didn't yield much useful information for the plumbers.
President Nixon mused about using the plumbers to break into the Brookings Institution, a think tank where two other scholars who had worked on the Pentagon Papers (Leslie Gelb and Morton Halperin) worked, so as to retrieve any related documents in their possession; Colson would eventually consider doing the job through a firebombing.
CRP, Nixon's campaign committee, illegally attempted to interfere in the 1972 Democratic primaries in a variety of ways. ""They made it their goal to get any stronger candidates eliminated,"" Drew tells me. ""I'm not saying they achieved [George] McGovern's nomination, but that was their goal.""
CRP operative Donald Segretti was involved in many of the worst of these efforts, including fabricating multiple documents with stationery from Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie, the 1968 vice presidential nominee and a strong contender for the presidency that year. One accused Sen. Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, also a 1972 contestant, of having an illegitimate child with a teenager and of having been arrested for homosexuality. Another slurred French-Canadians as ""Canucks,"" then a potent racial epithet; that damaged Muskie's standing in the New Hampshire primary and contributed to his eventual defeat.
And there was more that simply never got unearthed. There's tape of Colson bragging about blackmail efforts where even Nixon sounds surprised â€” but on the tape, Colson swears he'll take those secrets to his grave, and he seems to have kept his word (Colson died in 2012). Reviewing John Dean's book The Nixon Defense, Bob Woodward wrote that ""the full story of the Nixon administration's secret operations may forever remain buried along with their now-deceased perpetrators.""
3) Who found out the White House was involved in the break-in?

The White House's involvement was unearthed through a combination of government investigations into the break-in and investigative reporting by the Washington Post's Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. Within days of the break-in, Bernstein and Woodward figured out that one of the five men arrested for the crime, James McCord, had a contract to do security for the Republican National Committee, and had connected the burglars to Hunt, and Hunt to Colson.
On August 1, they reported that a $25,000 check earmarked for the Nixon campaign made its way to the bank account of Bernard Barker, who was also arrested in the break-in. By September, they had uncovered a secret slush fund used by former CRP head and Attorney General John Mitchell to investigate Democrats, and by October they knew about Segretti's sabotage efforts.
On September 15, 1972, the five burglars, Liddy, and Hunt were indicted by a federal grand jury. By January 1973 â€” after Nixon was reelected in a landslide, winning every state but Massachusetts and the District of Columbia â€” Hunt and the four of the actual burglars had pleaded guilty, and Liddy and McCord were found guilty after a trial.
But John Sirica, the district court judge who tried these defendants, stated he was ""not satisfied"" the full story of the break-in had been told, and on February 7, the Senate voted unanimously to create a temporary (""select"" in Congress jargon) committee, chaired by Democrat Sam Ervin of North Carolina, to investigate the break-in.
It became clear that the conspiracy â€” and, in particular, the cover-up â€” reached higher in March 1973, when McCord sent a letter to Sirica alleging a high-level cover-up and suggesting he feared retaliation if he were to ""disclose knowledge of the facts in this matter."" That same month, L. Patrick Gray, the acting FBI director, testified during his confirmation hearings to become permanent director that he had provided White House counsel John Dean with files concerning the FBI's investigation into the break-in, and that Dean had ""probably lied"" to investigators. From that point, it wasn't long before senior aides to the president began to be forced out for their involvement.
Gray himself resigned after it came out that he, at the behest of Dean and White House domestic policy adviser John Ehrlichman, had destroyed files from a safe belonging to Hunt. On April 30, Nixon fired Dean and accepted the resignations of his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and Ehrlichman, as well as his attorney general, Richard Kleindienst, while insisting that this did not constitute an admission of wrongdoing on the latter three staffers' parts.
By that point, however, Dean was actively cooperating with investigators, and would tell them that Nixon had actively participated in covering up the crime â€” an allegation later proven with tapes of White House conversations (but more on that later).
4) How did the White House try to obstruct investigations?

It's impossible to list all the varied ways the White House attempted to impair investigations from the grand jury, from the special Senate committee eventually formed to deal with the scandal, and from the independent counsel appointed to investigate the affair. But here are a few:
Within days of the break-in, Nixon decided to ask the CIA to disrupt the FBI's investigation of the incident, on the grounds that it concerned matters of national security; the CIA, however, resisted the order.
Throughout the FBI's early investigation, White House counsel Dean sat in on interviews with witnesses and got regular updates from Gray.
The White House paid hush money to co-conspirators, including $75,000 to Hunt personally; Nixon was caught on tape discussing the arrangements with Dean.
Nixon tried, to no avail, to have aides manufacture dictatape evidence to give to Judge Sirica.
Nixon implied to Ehrlichman that they should prevent Dean from continuing to cooperate with investigators by offering him clemency in exchange for keeping his mouth shut.
Ehrlichman ordered Colson to offer clemency to Hunt in exchange for silence.
Later, when it came out that there was hard tape evidence concerning Nixon and other aides' roles in the cover-up, the administration took extraordinary measures â€” including going to the Supreme Court and attempting an unprecedented quashing of a Justice Department investigation â€” to prevent it from coming to light. But more on that in a sec.
5) Can we take a quick music break?
Of course. The period from 1972 to 1974 was generally excellent for American music, but you wouldn't really know it from the singles charts. Case in point: The No. 1 record at the time of the break-in was Sammy Davis Jr.'s ""The Candy Man,"" which, while inspiring an excellent Simpsons number years later, is mostly an enervating bit of treacle without much going for it:
Nonetheless, ""The Candy Man"" is still preferable to the chart topper when Nixon resigned, John Denver's ""Annie's Song"":
It sold basically no copies upon initial release, but June 1972, the month of the break-in, saw the release of Big Star's #1 Record, my favorite record of all time and a power-pop classic. You can listen to the whole thing on Spotify. Here's the opener, ""Feel"":
6) What were the White House tapes?
While the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses had done some taping of presidential meetings, the Nixon administration was the first and only one to record the president's activity so completely (though his bedroom and residences in San Clemente and Key Biscayne were not taped). As former White House aide Alexander Butterfield â€” by then Federal Aviation Administration chief â€” testified before the Senate Watergate Committee in July 1973, the system began recording in the spring of 1971, and was activated by sound. Few people in the White House other than Nixon knew they were being recorded:
The tapes represented the single best source of evidence into the White House's involvement in the break-in, and as such, the administration tried desperately to prevent the Senate Watergate Committee or the independent counsel whom the attorney general had by then appointed to investigate the incident from getting ahold of them.
It ultimately took a unanimous Supreme Court ruling following the independent counsel's securing of a subpoena against the president to force their release. They contained what became known as the ""smoking gun"" recording, in which Haldeman and Nixon, days after the break-in, discuss using the CIA to hamper the FBI's investigative efforts. Within days of the public learning of the smoking gun tape, Nixon resigned from the presidency.
The tapes included an 18Â½-minute gap on June 20, 1972. The minutes are believed to include a conversation between Nixon and Haldeman about the Watergate arrests. Rose Mary Woods, Nixon's secretary, claimed that she accidentally erased the portion, but when she was asked to demonstrate how exactly that would have happened, the circumstance was so physically implausible that most discounted that explanation. Most plausible, according to Drew, is Ehrlichman's allegation that Nixon personally erased the tapes, presumably because they contained discussion of a cover-up.
In recent decades, as more and more tapes were made available to the public, journalists, and scholars by the National Archives, non-Watergate revelations about the Nixon presidency emerged. Nixon's anti-Semitism is on full display in the tapes, for example, and they also confirm Nixon and Henry Kissinger's support for the genocide being conducted by Pakistan's military government against Bangladesh in the latter's war for independence. Most recently, a tape of Nixon discussing panda sex garnered some attention.
7) What was the Saturday Night Massacre?

The fight for the tapes was mainly conducted between the Nixon administration and the independent counsel in the Justice Department appointed to investigate the Watergate break-in. The first such counsel was Archibald Cox, a former solicitor general from the Kennedy administration and a Harvard law professor. Cox subpoenaed the tapes, and the White House refused to comply, offering instead the ""Stennis Compromise"": John Stennis, a conservative Democratic senator from Mississippi, could listen to the tapes and verify they matched transcripts released by the White House. But Stennis was notoriously hard of hearing, and Cox would not agree to the deal.
What happened next was arguably one of the most brazen abuses of presidential power in American history. Nixon ordered his attorney general, Eliot Richardson, to fire Cox. Richardson refused, resigning instead. The new acting attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, refused as well, and resigned. The third in command at the Justice Department, Solicitor General Robert Bork (whom Ronald Reagan would later try and fail to appoint to the Supreme Court), finally carried out the order to fire Cox. The office of special prosecutor was abolished, and the investigation was sent back to the Justice Department proper.
The reaction to the events was furious. ""It was a terrifying night,"" Drew says. ""It felt like we were in a banana republic.""
""The television networks offered hour-long specials,"" Woodward and Bernstein write in their book The Final Days. They continue:
The newspapers carried banner headlines. Within two days, 150,000 telegrams had arrived in the capital, the largest concentrated volume in the history of Western Union. Deans of the most prestigious law schools in the country demanded that Congress commence an impeachment inquiry. By the following Tuesday, forty-four separate Watergate-related bills had been introduced in the House. Twenty-two called for an impeachment investigation.
The reaction forced Nixon to appoint a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, who would eventually succeed in his quest for the tapes.
8) What crimes did the House attempt to charge Nixon with?

The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon. It's worth remembering that Nixon was never actually impeached or convicted. Impeachment (the equivalent of an indictment in a normal trial) would have required a majority vote of the House, and removal from office a supermajority vote of the Senate. Nixon resigned before either could occur. That said, there was no question the votes were there to impeach him, and quite likely to remove him from office as well.
The first article approved by the House committee charged him with ""engag[ing] personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of [the Watergate break in]; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.""
The second article charged him with a variety of abuses, including attempting to use the IRS to investigate political enemies, using the FBI to do illegal surveillance, overseeing the break-in to Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office, and allowing the plumbers to work in the White House in general. The third article concerned his failure to comply with subpoenas from Cox, Jaworski, and the Senate Watergate Committee.
The first article was approved on July 27, 1974, very shortly before Nixon resigned, which rendered the impeachment process moot.
9) Who was punished for the break-in and similar wrongdoing?

More than a dozen White House officials and co-conspirators were charged with crimes relating to the Watergate scandal:
Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman, Nixon's closest aide, served 18 months for conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
Former attorney general and reelection campaign manager John Mitchell was found guilty of conspiracy, perjury, and obstruction of justice. He served 19 months in prison.
White House counsel John Dean only served four months for conspiracy to obstruct justice, due to his cooperation with investigators.
Domestic policy adviser John Ehrlichman was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice and perjury with regards to Watergate, and conspiracy in the case of Ellsberg's psychiatrist. He served 18 months.
Howard Hunt served 33 months for burglary, conspiracy, and wiretapping, to which he pleaded guilty.
G. Gordon Liddy, who refused to plead guilty, was sentenced to 20 years for Watergate, Ellsberg, and contempt of court, but that was commuted by Jimmy Carter, and he wound up serving only four and a half years.
Donald Segretti, Nixon's campaign operative/saboteur, served four and a half months after pleading guilty to three counts of distributing illegal campaign literature.
Chuck Colson, who was involved in putting together the plumbers and covering up the break-in, got seven months after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice. He went on to become a born-again Christian and vocal prison reform advocate.
Fred LaRue, a Nixon campaign adviser involved in the provision of hush money to participants in the break-in, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served four and a half months, a reduced sentence due to his cooperation.
Jeb Magruder, a White House aide turned campaign aide who helped plan the break-in with Liddy, served seven months, and went on to become a Presbyterian minister.
Nixon was never prosecuted for his role in the scandal due to a blanket pardon granted by his former vice president, Gerald Ford, shortly after Ford assumed the presidency.
Update: After this explainerâ€™s initial publication in 2014, Tim Naftali, former director of the Nixon Library, identified a few points of clarification, which have been incorporated into the post, including the fact that McCord turned on his co-conspirators in March 1973, that Nixon rather than Nixon and Haldeman decided to ask the CIA to disrupt the investigation, and that the CIA refused to cooperate before the FBI figured out the plot. We regret the errors concerning Nixon's request for CIA interference, and thank Mr. Naftali for his extensive help and additional details.
In addition, journalist Elizabeth Drew wrote in with additions after publication, including noting that the votes were likely there for impeachment and removal, and that Ehrlichman believed the gap in the tapes was caused by Nixon himself erasing them. We thank her for her extensive assistance."
"Most Christmas customs in the US share two characteristics. First, itâ€™s usually hard to pin down their origins to a single source. And second, their roots almost always reach back to religious custom â€” Christmas being the second most important feast day (behind Easter) on the Christian calendar â€” but have since been adapted and, in some cases, scrubbed of religious content to make them more broadly palatable.
The celebration of Advent â€” whether with wreaths in church or calendars at home â€” is among these customs. On the one hand, itâ€™s one of the major seasons celebrated by most Christian churches in the Western tradition: Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Episcopalians, Lutherans, and many additional Protestant churches mark the roughly month-long period with special observance.
But the word Advent comes from the Latin word for â€œarrivalâ€ â€” adventus â€” which means non-Christians can celebrate it simply as a fun countdown to Christmas. In that respect, itâ€™s also become a marketing opportunity for retailers, mostly through Advent calendars, which have been around since the 19th century and have of late grown steadily more, shall we say, creative.
Most modern Advent calendars donâ€™t technically cover the season of Advent
Most Advent calendars start on December 1. But the actual first day of the Advent season changes every year. In 2019, that day is December 1. In 2020, it will be November 29. The final day is the same every year: December 24, Christmas Eve â€” though many calendars run through Christmas Day.
The reason for the shifting start date is simpler than it appears. As celebrated by Christian churches in the Western tradition (as opposed to Eastern Orthodox churches, which keep a different calendar), the season of Advent begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas and is celebrated on each successive Sunday leading up to Christmas.
There are always four Sundays in Advent prior to Christmas, but Christmas could be any day of the week â€” which means the distance between the fourth Sunday of Advent and Christmas Day varies. So the length of the season shifts from year to year: In 2016, Christmas fell on a Sunday, which means the season stretched over a total of 28 days. Last year, it was 23 days long. This year, itâ€™s 24 days long.
Advent calendars, though, are more consistent. Theyâ€™re all set up for a 24- or 25-day season, beginning December 1 and ending on Christmas Eve or, sometimes, Christmas Day. The reason for this is practical: Since the length of the Advent season changes from year to year, itâ€™s easier to pick a fixed number of days for a calendar that can be reproduced or reused every season.
And Advent calendars are reused all the time. When I was growing up, the Advent calendar in our house had a picture of Mary, Joseph, and the baby Jesus in the manger, with little windows that we opened and read aloud â€” each contained a verse from the Christmas story. Other people had Advent calendars that held a piece of chocolate to be eaten each day.

Since the mid-19th century, Advent calendars have morphed to fit their time
Advent calendars (in one form or another) were adapted some time in the 19th century by German Lutherans as a way to mark the days of the season leading up to Christmas. By the early 20th century, calendars were being manufactured and published in Germany, aimed at delighting kids during the holidays.
In a chilling development, when Nazi Germany attempted to change Christmas from a religious holiday to an occasion to praise the fatherland (Jesusâ€™s Jewish origins being troublesome for Nazisâ€™ racist ideology), it latched onto the Advent calendar as a way of inculcating loyalty into children. In 1943, a full-color calendar was produced by the Third Reich for distribution to German mothers; it included, among other things, designs that incorporated swastikas and other Nazi symbols. On one day, it has pictures that appear to tell the traditional Christmas story â€” Mary, Joseph, and the baby Jesus in the manger â€” but the story that accompanies the images is about a woodcutter, a soldier, and a king who get lost in the woods and encounter a woman with a baby who has wise words for them.
Following the war, with cardboard no longer rationed, Christian-themed Advent calendars made their way stateside thanks to the boom in production and the GIs who sent them home to their families. They got a boost in popularity when Newsweek published a photograph of President Dwight D. Eisenhowerâ€™s grandchildren with an Advent calendar in 1953:

Advent calendars have continued to be popular in the years since, often marketed with the suggestion that they help children count down the days to Christmas (presumably to keep them from bugging their parents every day about how many days are left until they can open presents).
The text accompanying the needlepoint Advent calendar sold by Landsâ€™ End is typical of this marketing approach: â€œA little gift or treat every day can help kids get through the urgent days leading up to Christmas.â€ Pockets in the calendar can be filled by parents with toys or treats, small gifts to satiate the excited child. (One can detect some commonality between this and traditions around gift giving during Hanukkah.)
As such, Advent calendars aimed at children abound. Parents can help children put together a charm bracelet, or let them discover the art of Norman Rockwell. There are chocolate advent calendars in all shapes and sizes. There are calendars with puffy, soft shapes that slowly form a nativity scene or depict the adventures of Olaf from Frozen. Thereâ€™s a popular Disney Tsum Tsum Advent calendar, a Lego Star Wars Advent calendar, and a whole bunch of Playmobil Advent Calendars.
A specifically Christian variation called a â€œJesse Treeâ€ combines the Christmas tree with an Advent calendar, taking its cues from Isaiah 11:1, which many Christians take to be a prophecy about Jesus: â€œThere shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.â€ Jesse was the father of King David, who is said to be an ancestor of Jesus, and a tree depicting this lineage was often the subject of stained glass windows in churches. Ornaments with symbols that tell the Christmas story are placed on the tree each day until, by Christmas, itâ€™s full. Participants can buy all kinds of Jesse Tree ornament sets, from rustic wooden ones to whimsical felt ones, or just make their own.
While Advent calendars were mainly used by religious families (and the Third Reich) for much of their history, today theyâ€™ve expanded to include non-ideological and adult audiences. Today, Advent calendars are available for virtually any taste, interest, or price point. Many Advent calendars serve as a way for brands to get 24 samples of their products into the hands of potential customers â€” not a bad marketing move in a month typically associated with spending money. If customers like the sample, the reasoning goes, then theyâ€™ll be inclined to buy the full-size version with their Christmas money. (This is in keeping with custom: The first chocolate Advent calendar was produced by Cadbury in 1958.)
Among the Advent calendars aimed and disposable-income-laden adults, thereâ€™s a calendar for Godiva chocolate, Diptyque scents, CiatÃ© London nail polish, and Too Faced cosmetics. Or you can sample a variety of themed products: socks, jerky, whisky, gin, scotch, rum, craft beer, cheese, sex toys, and â€œbeard treats.â€
Advent calendars donâ€™t necessarily have to be physical objects, either. Music lovers can download a musical Advent calendar app from Naxos, and web design geeks can indulge in the digital 24 Ways Advent calendar, which dispenses design and coding advice over the 24 days leading up to Christmas. Some towns â€” like the English city of Henley-on-Thames â€” create living Advent calendars.
In a very cool custom I think the US ought to adopt immediately, some Nordic countries traditionally run an Advent television series, called a Julekalender, beginning on December 1 and running until Christmas Eve â€” think of it as a limited miniseries. The tradition started on radio in 1957 and first ran on Swedish television in 1960. Sometimes the show ties into a paper calendar that can be purchased in stores, and each day whatâ€™s behind the dayâ€™s calendar flap ties into the show. (An American radio show called The Cinnamon Bear was broadcast in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and was similarly arranged â€” six times a week from Thanksgiving to Christmas.)
But though Advent customs differ, they all circle back to adventus: the anticipation of something. Advent calendars are designed for anticipating the arrival of Christmas Day, in both its explicitly religious and more secularized versions.
The roots of Advent celebration, though, go further back than 19th-century Germany â€” stretching way back into the traditional Western Christian tradition, before Advent calendars were invented. That celebration has its own symbolism tied to the Christian calendar, and itâ€™s still carried out in churches all over the world to this day.
Adventâ€™s roots in Christian tradition persist to this day
Nobody seems to know precisely when the Western Christian church started marking Advent as a season on its calendar. But it seems to have popped up early in church history, and has stayed remarkably stable since about the Middle Ages.
The easiest way to understand the Christian churchâ€™s calendar is as a sort of live immersive theater, designed by tradition to reenact the life of Jesus every year from Christmas (birth) to Easter (resurrection), with readings in traditional churches that revisit stories from the gospels each year during that time. Advent â€” adventus â€” is the part of the calendar thatâ€™s all about anticipation. In Christian teaching, there are two events being anticipated.
Part of the observance of Advent, celebrated for the four Sundays before Christmas, is reenacting the centuries of anticipation of the birth of Jesus as written about by prophets like Isaiah in the Old Testament. Many songs traditionally sung during the season have lines recalling this waiting period, such as â€œO Holy Nightâ€ (â€œLong lay the world in sin and error pining / â€™Til he appeared and the soul felt its worthâ€). Thatâ€™s also why the early parts of Handelâ€™s Messiah quote the prophet Isaiah before they get to the more familiar Christmas parts: The lyrics for â€œComfort Ye My Peopleâ€ and â€œEvery Valley Shall Be Exalted,â€ for instance, correspond directly to the readings from Isaiah 40 that a person might hear in a church pew during Advent.
But Christian theology also contains a belief that at the end of days, Jesus will return to set things right in the world, erasing death and suffering â€” a concept usually called the Second Coming. So in addition to being about the anticipation of Jesusâ€™s birth (the first coming), Advent is also set aside as a time of quietness and austerity, meant to keep Christians from glossing over the brokenness of the world and to encourage them to anticipate the Second Coming.
â€œJoy to the Worldâ€ â€” which, in traditional Christian practice, should only be sung at the conclusion of Advent â€” contains a verse summarizing this side of the celebration: â€œNo more let sins and sorrows grow / Nor thorns infest the ground / He comes to make His blessings flow / Far as the curse is found.â€
Religious observance of Advent comes with its own set of symbols
In churches that celebrate Advent, the most common factor across denominations is the Advent wreath, which was adopted around the Middle Ages. Itâ€™s like a normal Christmas wreath, but presented horizontally, often on a podium at the front of the church (though people often have them in their homes as well). There are typically candleholders for tapers in the wreath. The colors vary slightly from denomination to denomination, but the wreath always has four candles on it â€” typically three dark purple or blue, one rose-colored â€” and a white candle in the middle to light on Christmas Eve.

On each of the four Sundays of Advent, the candles are lit: one on the first Sunday, two on the second, and so on. If thereâ€™s a rose candle (which is meant to symbolize joy), itâ€™s lit on the third Sunday, which is around the midpoint of Advent, a time to celebrate that the waiting is nearing its close.
In keeping with the theme of waiting and remembering, Advent is also traditionally marked with a fast, similar to the Lenten fast that many people (even those who are only marginally observant) practice during the 40 days before Easter. Advent is shorter than Lent, and the fast is less widely practiced, but generally people choose to give up something â€” a type of food, a practice or habit, and, lately, Facebook â€” in order to focus on prayer and preparation for the celebration of Christmas.
Additionally, some churches change the colors of the cloths and linens used in the sanctuary during Sunday services â€” often to purple. Churches hold off on singing jubilant Christmas songs, instead opting for Advent hymns, the most popular of which is probably â€œO Come, O Come, Emmanuel,â€ a translation of a Latin hymn. Some churches make a practice of giving away more money or participating in other community-wide practices during the season of Advent. (One newish one is the Advent Conspiracy, started by a loose affiliation of churches in 2006 to combat hyperconsumerism and help fund clean water initiatives.)
As with pretty much every Christmas custom, though, Advent doesnâ€™t just belong to Christians who celebrate it â€” itâ€™s been broadened to include everyone who takes part in the holiday, whatever meaning they take from it. Every Advent observance, regardless of whether it includes a religious element, touches on a need to have a bit of beauty each day during the season. And itâ€™s all in anticipation of future joy."
"On Friday night, Sen. Kamala Harris made a campaign trail promise that grabbed some attention: If drug companies refuse to lower their prices, â€œI will snatch their patent so we can take over.â€
According to the Washington Postâ€™s Dave Weigel, somebody in attendance asked the obvious question: Can you do that? â€œYes, we can do that,â€ Harris replied. â€œWe just need the will to do that.â€
Sheâ€™s not the only candidate making this promise. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg have also made similar pledges. High drug costs are one of the top health care concerns for Americans, and the candidates are billing this as something the next Democratic president could pursue on their own, with or without the support of Congress.
This whole debate centers on the patent system. The way the US drug development system works is pharmaceutical companies are granted long monopolies on new drugs, which is supposed to reward them for new treatments and allow them to recoup the money they invested in researching and developing them.
But the resulting lack of competition also gives them wide leverage to set high prices. If the government were able to break those monopolies and grant patents to other competing companies, that would help to bring prices down. Thatâ€™s the logic of the promise Harris and others are making.
Are they right? Maybe. But unsurprisingly, the truth is a little more complicated than the campaign rhetoric.
March-in rights, explained
The means of forcibly lowering drug costs that comes up most often is known as â€œmarch-in rights.â€ That provision was included in the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which set all kinds of rules for patents and inventions that were created with government support.
The â€œmarch-inâ€ provision allows the federal government to license a new patent to another entity under certain circumstances. The first, and most important, condition is that the invention (the medication, for our purposes) depended on government support. That would arguably apply to almost any drug that comes on the market: As STAT reported in 2018, every one of the 210 prescription drugs approved from 2010 to 2016 relied directly or indirectly on research funded by the National Institutes of Health.
But that is not sufficient, under Bayh-Dole. Other conditions must be met. The law sets out several circumstances under which the government can â€œmarch inâ€ and issue competing patents. One favored by those who advocate for aggressive action dictates that march-in action is necessary when the patent owner has not and is not expected to pursue the practical application of the patented invention (drug). The law elaborates to say the inventionâ€™s benefits must be â€œavailable to the public on reasonable termsâ€ or else march-in rights could be exercised.
It is the â€œreasonable termsâ€ language that two college professors cited to argue in 2001 that the government could use march-in rights to intervene when drug prices are too high. Before then, there had been only one instance of petitioners asking the government to utilize march-in rights to reduce drug costs. Since then, five more such petitions have been submitted to NIH.
Yet none of them have been granted, with both the Bush and Obama administrations declining to use march-in rights. The reason is quite simple, as Georgetown professor John Thomas reviewed for the Congressional Research Service in 2016: The government, at least to date, does not believe high prices are a sufficient reason to exercise march-in rights.
In 2004, the NIH made its position plain and the agency has not wavered in the intervening years:
The NIH agrees with the public testimony that suggested that the extraordinary remedy of march-in is not an appropriate means of controlling prices. The issue of drug pricing has global implications and, thus, is appropriately left for Congress to address legislatively.
Now a new administration inclined to use march-in rights could potentially come to a different conclusion.
â€œIf the administration were really serious about not just lowering drug costs, but using fairly extreme measures to do it, this is a strategy they could use today if they wanted to,â€ says Rachel Sachs, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.
It is notable that Warren, in detailing her executive agenda for health care, cited a different condition set out in Bayh-Dole than the â€œreasonable termsâ€ â€” one that allows for march-in action to alleviate health and safety needs â€” in pledging to use her executive authority to lower drug costs. But the legal perils of using march-in rights are evident, given the precedents set by prior administrations and the peculiarities of the language of Bayh-Dole.
USC 1498, explained
In other words, the government can authorize the production of cheaper versions of patented drugs so long as they pay the company that owns the original patent a fair price.
The authors note that the government has used this authority before or threatened to as a means of leverage with drug makers: in the 1960s, the Defense Department bought an antibiotic from an Italian company instead of the US patent holder, because the Italian version was more than 70 percent cheaper. More recently, in 2001, the Bush health department threatened to use 1498 to purchase an antibiotic that is used to treat anthrax exposure; the US patent holder cut its prices in half in response.
However, the use of 1498 declined in the 1970s, for reasons the Yale authors say are unclear. There are some obvious explanations: Namely, the drug industry was viciously opposed from the start to such strong-arming by the federal government. Coming up with appropriate compensation for the patent holder was another possible culprit, as well as a general shift toward â€œpropertarianâ€ thinking, a libertarian ethos that grants something close to absolute authority to a property owner.
The recent crisis of high drug costs has renewed interest in 1498, however. The Yale authors make the case that the code could be applied for the new hepatitis C treatments that can effectively cure the disease but also come with a very large price tag (the first treatment came on the market at $84,000 a pop).
Other academics have argued that the federal government could exploit the statute to compel lower prices for naloxone, the opioid overdose treatment. The provision could be effective in two ways, supporters argue: either through the direct purchase of cheaper alternatives to expensive drugs or by forcing the US patent holders to come to the table and negotiate a lower price so as to keep the business for themselves.
Intense lobbying at the least and possibly litigation would surely follow the governmentâ€™s pursuit of 1498. At the least, drug companies will want a lot of compensation.
It has been sitting on the shelf for a long time for a reason. But the Yale authors make the case that there is strong precedent for using the provision to extract lower drug costs, at least when there is a strong public health case to be made. Warren notably limits her proposed actions to drugs where there is clearly a strong public health need, Sachs pointed out, like for insulin or for EpiPens.
One other potential limitation is FDA exclusivity periods, which are separate from the patents awarded to drug companies. During those periods, the FDA canâ€™t approve another drug for the same condition and a drug maker cannot be compelled to share materials with a generic competitor, Sachs says. So the sweet spot for 1498 action would be for drugs that have had their exclusivity periods expire but that are still on patent.
â€œIf you think companies really do need some time on the market to recoup investment, then they can achieve some type of return,â€ Sachs tells me. â€œBut after that, if a company is behaving in an anti-competitive fashion, then the government can step in and restrain these bad actors.â€
If the next president pulls out either of these tools, they would surely be met with resistance. But there are clear openings under existing federal law for an ambitious executive to attempt through administrative action to reduce drug costs. As Harris said in her comments over the weekend, all it requires is the will to do it.

"The fight to preserve the Amazon rainforest has taken many forms. In Brazil, the government has banned all extractive industries on some pieces of land, and allowed some activity on others. But arguably the most effective way to preserve the rainforest has been giving it back to the people who have been there the longest.
Brazil is home to over 900,000 indigenous people, many of whom live in the Amazon. They are descendants of people who lived in the rainforest for centuries without destroying it. But like many place around the world, these indigenous people were brutally persecuted when Europeans arrived. In Brazil, indigenous people were systematically pushed off their land by the government and even killed well into the 20th century.
In 1988, things changed. Brazil enacted a new constitution that gave historic rights to indigenous people; including the right to get their land back. Itâ€™s resulted in the creation of nearly 400 indigenous reserves, many of which are in the Amazon. Here, indigenous people are free to keep their traditions, language, and culture alive. In most cases, that includes an expert preservation of the rainforest.
But things are again changing for the worst. The rise of agriculture has put Brazilâ€™s indigenous people at risk again. Their lands are being invaded by farmers, ranchers, and land grabbers eager to make a profit. To make matters worse, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is not coming to the rescue.

"The dramatic ouster of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer this weekend is part of a much bigger crisis: one that involves a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes, competing Pentagon and White House stories, congressional anger, and a president who has waded into one of the most sensitive and politically charged military justice cases in decades.
The end of Spencerâ€™s career is inextricably linked with the trial of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was accused of murdering an ISIS captive, shooting civilians, and threatening those in his charge who gave their superiors information on him during his time in Iraq. He was acquitted by military jury of those charges in July, but the Navy still demoted him after he was found guilty of posing in a photo next to the dead body of the teenage detainee.
President Donald Trump took a keen interest in Gallagherâ€™s case. Nine days ago, he signed an order directing the restoration of the commandoâ€™s previous rank. Then on Thursday, the president tweeted that the Navy should stop a review into whether or not to boot Gallagher out of the elite unit, which would lead to the loss of the coveted gold Trident pin.
This situation increased political passions to the point that Tim Parlatore, Gallagherâ€™s lead attorney, and his family received death threats. â€œThe environment around this entire case is different, very different,â€ he told me. The SEALâ€™s critics are â€œnot looking at facts of the case, but because President Trump is involved they say â€˜we hate you.â€™ Thatâ€™s kind of a problem.â€
The Navy defied Trumpâ€™s pressure, vowing it would continue the disciplinary review despite Trumpâ€™s tweeted wishes. Spencer, the Navyâ€™s highest-ranking civilian official, and Rear Adm. Collin Green, the unitâ€™s commander, both reportedly considered resigning if Trump officially intervened in proceedings.
On Saturday evening, Spencer told me and other reporters convened at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada that those reports were false. â€œI have not threatened to resign,â€ he said. â€œIf the president requests to the stop the process, the process stops. Good order and discipline is also obeying orders from the president of the United States.â€
And then all hell broke news the next day: Spencer was out of a job over his handling of the Gallagher case. But itâ€™s still unclear exactly why: Pentagon leadership says it lost faith in Spencer and that Trump officially ordered that Gallagher should keep his pin; Trump claims he was angry about naval programs along with the Gallagher issue, and the former Navy secretary says he resigned due to his oath to the Constitution.
This may all seem like silly Washington insider-y politics. But this drama has damaged relations between civilian leadership and the military they lead â€” while, in some expertsâ€™ minds, diverting attention away from whatâ€™s most important.
â€œThe increasingly political position the military has found itself in are a dangerous distractor from what matters most: protecting and defending Americaâ€™s interests at home and abroad,â€ Guy Snodgrass, a retired Navy commander and chief speechwriter for former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, told me.
Whatâ€™s more, thereâ€™s an argument to be made Spencer was illegally pushed out since the president didnâ€™t directly fire him.
To help make sense of this confusing story, hereâ€™s a guide to the three narratives of Spencerâ€™s ouster â€” as well as why it matters, and what it might mean for the future of the US military.
The three accounts of Spencerâ€™s ouster, explained
Typically, a high-level officialâ€™s removal has a clear story behind it. Either he or she did something bad and a superior pushed them out, or they decided to resign for personal or professional reasons.
But the multiple official stories from the Trump administration donâ€™t mesh with one another, and on their faces the Pentagon and White House accounts donâ€™t make much sense.
The Pentagon says it received an order for Gallagher to keep his pin, and that it lost faith in Spencer
On Sunday night, chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman released a lengthy statement explaining that Spencer would no longer serve as Secretary of the Navy.
â€œSecretary of Defense Mark T. Esper has asked for the resignation of Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer after losing trust and confidence in him regarding his lack of candor over conversations with the White House involving the handling of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher,â€ Hoffman said.
â€œSecretary Esper learned that Secretary Spencer had previously and privately proposed to the White House â€” contrary to Spencerâ€™s public position â€” to restore Gallagherâ€™s rank and allow him to retire with his Trident pin.â€
â€œSecretary Esper was never informed by Secretary Spencer of his private proposal,â€ Hoffman continued. â€œ[G]iven the events of the last few days, Secretary Esper has directed that Gallagher retain his Trident pin.â€
The key part there is that Esper says Spencer worked a secret deal, likely with the president, to rig the disciplinary review to allow Gallagher to keep his Trident pin. Keeping Esper out of the loop didnâ€™t sit well with him, per this telling, so he asked Spencer to resign.
The problem is that this narrative doesnâ€™t make much sense. Trump wanted Gallagher to keep his Trident pin, as his tweets indicate. If Spencer was going to give Trump what he and Gallagher wanted, then why would the president want the Navy chief gone?
Esper added a wrinkle to all this on Monday, telling reporters he received an order from Trump for Gallagher keep his pin, and that Spencer told him he might have to resign if asked to implement that directive. But again, if Spencer and Trump already worked out this secret deal, then why would the president need to give that order in the first place?
If youâ€™re sensing that something seems off, youâ€™d be right. It only gets more confusing when you see Spencerâ€™s letter on the whole thing, which led Esper also to tell reporters â€œI canâ€™t reconcile public statements with private statements with the written word.â€
Spencer says he resigned â€œto support and defend the Constitutionâ€
Roughly an hour after Hoffmanâ€™s Sunday statement, Spencerâ€™s letter confirming his termination became public. It contained a scathing message for the president and aimed to clarify why he would no longer serve as the Navyâ€™s boss.
â€œThe rule of law is what sets us apart from our adversaries,â€ he wrote. â€œUnfortunately it has become apparent that in this respect, I no longer share the same understanding with the Commander in Chief who appointed me in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline. I cannot in good conscience obey an order that I believe violates the sacred oath I took in the presence of my family, my flag and my faith to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.â€
That sentiments fits with what Spencer told Reuters on Friday: that the Gallagher review should proceed unimpeded. â€œI believe the process matters for good order and discipline,â€ he said. It also somewhat confirms Esperâ€™s account that Trump did, in fact, order that the SEAL be allowed to keep his pin.
There appears to be a broader back story to this situation, though. A source close to Spencer told me that Army Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chair, worked to broker a deal that would allow Spencer to keep his job and allow the Gallagher review to move forward, though the source wasnâ€™t sure what the exact deal was.
The Washington Postâ€™s David Ignatius seemingly heard the same on Sunday night. He reports that as of Thursday it seemed that Milleyâ€™s back-channel work had paid off. â€œMissiles back in their silos â€¦ for the time being,â€ a Pentagon official told Ignatius at the time. But, Ignatius writes, on Saturday the White House wanted to know if Spencer had threatened to resign, despite his denials.
The next day, Esper delivered the bad news to Spencer, per Ignatius: â€œThe president wants you to go.â€
If thatâ€™s the case, then Spencerâ€™s resignation may have had more to do with Trumpâ€™s desires than his own stance.
But if Spencer did broker that secret deal with Trump â€” as the Pentagon claims â€” why would the president want him gone, then? Itâ€™s possible Trump pushed Spencer out solely for defying him openly and not just because of his original stance on the Gallagher review.
And, of course, Trump muddied the waters up even further soon after the letterâ€™s release.
Trump says Esper â€œterminatedâ€ Spencer
Trump put out his own Twitter statement Sunday night to explain why Spencer would no longer be his Navy secretary.
There are two things to note from this. First, Trump added his displeasure with Spencerâ€™s handling of the Navy to why the secretary should be dismissed. Thatâ€™s somewhat understandable. For example, in January Spencer told Trump he would ensure broken elevators on USS Ford aircraft carrier would soon be ready before deployment â€” or else.
â€œI shook his hand and said, the elevators will be ready to go when she pulls out or you can fire me,â€ he told a Washington audience at the Center for a New American Security think tank. â€œWeâ€™re going to get it done. I know Iâ€™m going to get it done. I havenâ€™t been fired yet by anyone; being fired by the president really isnâ€™t on the top of my list.â€ However, the $13 billion vessel isnâ€™t ready for combat yet.
Second, and most importantly, Trump said that Esper â€œterminatedâ€ Spencer â€” a clear implication that the defense secretary removed the Navy boss. If the president didnâ€™t directly fire Spencer, then his ouster may be an illegal one. Steve Vladeck, a national security law expert at the University of Texas at Austin, noted Sunday on Twitter that the Navy secretary can only be fired by the person who appointed him: the president. Other experts I spoke with agreed.
Parlatore, Gallagherâ€™s lawyer, told me he applauds Trumpâ€™s actions in defending his client anyway. â€œThe president has an obligation to step in â€” heâ€™s the commander in chief,â€ he said. â€œIf his subordinates arenâ€™t taking care of business, he has an obligation to step in.â€
He continued, â€œIâ€™d hope anybody sitting in the Oval Office would pick up the phone and do something about it.â€
The fight over Spencer will continue
For many, the Gallagher matter is now over. The SEAL released a statement on Sunday thanking Trump for showing â€œtrue moral fiber by correcting all the wrongs that were being done to me.â€ The next day, Joint Chiefs chair Milley told reporters the struggle over Gallagherâ€™s Trident pin is â€œcase closedâ€ and Esper said he wants the Navy and SEALs to â€œmove beyond this now.â€
But others, mainly Democrats, want to know exactly why Spencer is now out of the administration â€” which could prolong the amount of time this issue remains a thorn in the administrationâ€™s side.
Sen. Tim Kaine â€” a Democrat from Virginia, which is home to the largest naval complex in the world â€” released a Monday statement calling for a probe into Spencerâ€™s ouster. â€œWe have many unanswered questions about Secretary Spencerâ€™s departure,â€ he said. â€œThe Senate Armed Services Committee must fully investigate what happened to ensure accountability.â€
Rep. Anthony Brown (D-MD), the vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee and a former judge advocate general in the US Army, said Monday that Trump â€œsubverted our military justice system and undercut all those who serve our country while upholding its values.â€
Republicans, though, appear to be standing by the administrationâ€™s decision. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the SASC chair, had no qualms about Spencerâ€™s removal, â€œBoth Secretary Esper and President Trump deserve to have a leadership team who has their trust and confidence.â€
Which means the controversy surrounding Spencerâ€™s ouster will likely continue well into the future as Democrats and Republicans debate the circumstances. Itâ€™s therefore likely that more information will come out about what really happened to the former navy secretary â€” and just precisely what role Trump may have played in all of it."
"I have been writing a lot lately about a big trend in the energy world, namely the decentralization of the energy system. Almost all electricity used to be generated at large power plants and carried over long-distance, high voltage transmission lines before it was dumped into local distribution grids. These days, a small but growing fraction of it is generated, stored, and managed within the distribution grid itself.
This is accomplished by an array of distributed energy resources (DERs) â€” from solar panels to batteries to EVs â€” that are increasingly tied together and coordinated by software. And as more and more cars and buildings are electrified, there will be more DERs to juggle. Keeping distribution grids running smoothly will become a bigger and bigger challenge.
Even as distribution grids struggle to digitize, much of electrical infrastructure remains resolutely stuck in the 20th century, manual and analog. Take the humble circuit breaker for example. Every electrical device in the country is connected to the grid through one. Its job is simply to cut off the flow of current to an electrical circuit in the case of a fault or surge, to prevent overloaded lines, sparks, and fires.
If youâ€™re a homeowner, youâ€™re probably familiar with the experience: the power in the kitchen suddenly goes out, you struggle briefly to remember where your electrical panel is, you find it and squint with your flashlight at the tiny, inscrutable labels, finding the one that says â€œKITâ€ and manually flipping the switch. Then you yell, â€œDid that do it?â€
When you think about how you interact with almost every other system in your day-to-day life, it seems primitive.
The circuit breaker goes digital
The basic design of the circuit breaker has not changed appreciably since Thomas Edison came up with the idea toward the end of the 19th century. Itâ€™s still an electromechanical switch that manually breaks an electrical connection, separating two wires.
Circuit breakers donâ€™t just drag building owners into their basements to squint at electrical panels, theyâ€™re slow enough that they still allow lots of short circuits and arc flashes, which can destroy property and even kill people. â€œEach year in the United States, arcing faults are responsible for starting more than 28,000 home fires,â€ says the non-profit Electrical Safety Foundation International, â€œkilling and injuring hundreds of people, and causing over $700 million in property damage.â€
Plus, mechanical circuit breakers are static. One rated for 30 amps will always and only handle 30 amps. They are ill-suited to the constantly shifting, evolving world of DERs.
For years, researchers and entrepreneurs have pursued something better, and in January, a small company in North Carolina called Atom Power became the first to pass the necessary tests to bring one to market: a solid-state digital circuit breaker.
Solid state means no moving parts, with less maintenance, and a much longer life. In place of mechanical switches, current is interrupted by semiconductors, which means it happens at around the speed of light. Specifically, when triggered, a semiconductor-controlled switch trips in 3 microseconds, roughly 3,000 times faster than the fastest mechanical switch.
In this 2018 video, electrical engineer and founder Ryan Kennedy explains how Atom got there first. It has to do with manufacturing semiconductors out of silicon carbide (a mix of silicon and carbon, also known as carborundum) rather than silicon.
First, it enables the semiconductor to be six to 10 times smaller, allowing the products to mimic the size and shape of traditional breakers and electrical panels. Second, it is much more efficient than silicon, especially at high voltages, and unlike mechanical switches, its efficiency rises as voltage falls. And third, it is much more fault tolerant at high temperatures than silicon, allowing the product to pass strict testing by the Underwriters Laboratories. (UL, a consumer safety research laboratory, is approved by the federal government to set safety standards for a wide range of consumer products in the US and Canada.)
This suggests two things. First, Atom has pulled off something clever, with a fairly small team. Three cheers for American innovation! And second, competitors wonâ€™t be far behind. After all, silicon carbide isnâ€™t patented. Other companies, big players, are already investing in their own digital circuit breakers. This is going to be a hot market in coming years.
So letâ€™s take a look at digitally controlled electricity â€” what it can do and what it might enable.
Digitally controlled electricity is safer
First and most importantly, because semiconductors react so much faster than mechanical switches, they are much safer, effectively eliminating short circuits and arc flash, as demonstrated in this video:
(Every product looks cooler with a metal soundtrack.)
Digital circuit breakers can even anticipate and thwart faults before they happen. Faults are preceded by small disruptions in the electricity sine wave, and â€œsince weâ€™re sensing in the microsecond range and opening in the nanosecond range,â€ Kennedy explains, â€œyou can interrupt that [fault] well before it propagates.â€ (Mechanical switches, on the other hand, donâ€™t know that they need to trip until thereâ€™s a fault.)
Atom claims the Atom Switch is the fastest and safest circuit breaker in the world, capable of lightspeed interruption of currents up to 150,000 amps.
But controlling electricity digitally can do much more than solve common safety problems.
Digital circuit breakers are packed into panels that replace several other devices
In recent years, materials science and computing power have advanced enough to allow Atom to stuff a little computer into each breaker. Each has its own firmware, its own unique identity on the network, and a little e-ink display of its status (which works even without power).
The breakers are stacked into a panel that has roughly the shape and appearance of a normal electrical panel. Each panel contains a copy of Atom OS, the operating system that allows the breakers to be controlled through a user interface. Each panel is assigned its own IP address, so controlling it just involves logging on with a computer, iPad, or phone through a router. Importantly, because the firmware and OS are contained within the panel itself, it requires no external connection to the web (or any external server) to work. The building owner has total control.
As of now, Kennedy estimates that Atom Switches are two to five times the cost of conventional mechanical switches. But because the breakers are digitally controlled, they can accomplish tasks that used to require multiple pieces of equipment.
In big commercial facilities, conventional circuit breakers are surrounded by, to quote an IEEE Spectrum piece on Atom, â€œmeters, load controllers, surge-protection devices, power-transfer switches, and demand management systems,â€ all of which require specialized equipment. The computers controlling digital switches can accomplish all those functions, thus replacing all that infrastructure.
Through their firmware, digital switches can meter power, dynamically control amperage based on load, and prevent surges and faults by specifying instantaneous, short-time, and long-time trip settings (along with a variety of other parameters I donâ€™t begin to understand, but Atom assures me are of great interest to the people who manage these systems).
The OS also has contains built-in motor control (motor â€œsoft-startingâ€ is a big problem for commercial electrical systems, for reasons we neednâ€™t get into), relay protections for over- or under-voltage events, and fast (80 microsecond) switching between power sources.
All these functions can be set remotely, put on a schedule, and programmed to react dynamically according to conditions.
All of that may sound like electricity-system jargon, but the point is that controlling power digitally enables a radical reduction of electrical infrastructure and simplification of electricity management. Finally, thereâ€™s an app for that.
Digitally controlled electricity could enable smarter distribution grids and more decentralized energy
Since they passed UL testing, Atomâ€™s products have drawn investment from three of the four largest circuit breaker manufacturers: ABB, Siemens, and Eaton. For now, the company is going after commercial and industrial facilities with lots of high-value loads at stake. For instance, it has a whole brief on how buildings that manage multiple EV chargers â€” sure to be a growing category, including many office parks and parking garages â€” can use digital power management to balance out loads and distribute capacity (and eventually deal with vehicle-to-grid technology).
The market will begin among commercial and industrial customers, but if digital circuit breakers prove their value in the field, thereâ€™s no reason to think the market wonâ€™t scale up. As it does, costs will come down. Itâ€™s easy to envision all circuit breakers, through attrition, eventually going digital, though itâ€™s impossible to predict how fast that might happen.
There are millions and millions of circuit breakers in the US. If every one of them becomes a self-aware, dynamically adapting, remotely controllable computer capable of linking up and coordinating with all the other computers, distribution grids will become much smarter and distributed energy resources (DERs) will be much easier to integrate and control.
I asked Kennedy if the same basic technology controlling a panel could be scaled up to support a microgrid or even a whole distribution system. The short answer, he said, is yes. He compared the modularity of the digital circuit breaker to the Tesla battery, which is the same basic thing in a sedan and a semi-truck. There are just more of them stacked together in the truck.
Same with digital electricity controls. â€œOur technology is not only scalable, but itâ€™s also significantly easier and faster to scale than mechanical breakers today,â€ Kennedy says. â€œYou could adapt and scale the technology for practically any power system.â€
As I have written, one key aspect of the clean energy transition, one reason itâ€™s likely to proceed faster than previous energy transitions in history, is that it wonâ€™t just be about switching out one set of machines for another. In large part, it will be about substituting intelligence for stuff â€” i.e., computing power for labor and material.
Computing power, which is always getting cheaper, will help determine how to maintain the same energy services with less labor and material, which are almost always getting more expensive. All analog systems will eventually go digital.
The digital circuit breaker is just one key step in the process of digitizing the electricity system. As software comes to control and distribute more power, AI, machine learning, and ubiquitous sensing will be put to use making the process more efficient, enabling the smart integration of local distributed energy resources. The result will be a smarter, cleaner, and more democratic grid."
"New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. City of New York, the biggest guns case to reach the Supreme Court in more than a decade, began with a tiny dispute.
New York City offers two kinds of licenses to gun owners. A â€œcarryâ€ license permits them to carry a handgun for â€œtarget practice, hunting, or self-defense.â€ The less permissive â€œpremisesâ€ license, meanwhile, permits gun owners to â€œhave and possess in his dwellingâ€ a handgun. Under a now-repealed rule, premise license holders were only allowed to bring the gun out of their home for limited purposes, including to practice shooting at seven specific gun ranges.
The plaintiffs in New York State Rifle brought a narrow challenge to this framework. As a federal appeals court explained in an opinion upholding the cityâ€™s repealed rule, some of the plaintiffs â€œseek to transport their handguns to shooting ranges and competitions outside New York City.â€ One plaintiff also owns two homes, and he wants to be able to transport the same gun between these two homes.
Thatâ€™s it. They sued for a small expansion of the rights afforded to people with premises licenses. And indeed, last July, the state acquiesced: It passed a law permitting people with premises licenses to do the very thing that these plaintiffs wish to do. That renders the case moot â€” or so one would think.
Yet the Supreme Court has so far refused to dismiss the case as moot. And if the plaintiffs have their way, the Court will wind up deciding a much bigger question than the one it originally agreed to hear.
Paul Clement, the prominent conservative lawyer representing the plaintiffs, submitted a brief that presents the case as a grand fight over â€œdraconian restrictions on the possession and transport of handguns.â€ Even though his clients already won with New York City and State changing its laws to accommodate them, Clement wants to proceed. And heâ€™s urging the Court to see this case as a much bigger challenge than the one his clients raised in the lower courts.
Thatâ€™s a highly unusual move. The Supreme Courtâ€™s rules instruct lawyers that merits briefs â€œmay not raise additional questions or change the substance of the questionsâ€ originally presented to the Court.
In any event, itâ€™s not hard to guess why gun rights advocates hope that this case becomes larger. The case was first brought in 2013, with the relatively moderate Anthony Kennedy on the Court. In 2019, Kennedy is gone and the more conservative Brett Kavanaugh is in his place. New York State Rifle could significantly expand Second Amendment rights now that we have a more conservative Supreme Court.
The plaintiffsâ€™ original modest ask, in other words, made sense when they probably thought they could only win incremental victories before a relatively moderate Court. But now they most likely have five votes for something much bigger. So why not ask for a revolution?
Kennedyâ€™s retirement is likely to change everything about the Second Amendment
Months before his death earlier this year, retired Justice John Paul Stevens revealed some of the Courtâ€™s secret deliberations in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the landmark Supreme Court decision holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. In Heller, the Court divided 5-4 along ideological lines, and Kennedy joined his fellow conservatives in the majority.
Yet, in a 2018 interview with the New York Timesâ€™ Adam Liptak, Stevens revealed that Kennedy requested â€œsome important changesâ€ to the original draft of the Heller opinion. This language stated that Heller â€œshould not be taken to cast doubtâ€ on many existing gun laws.
The final Heller opinion states that â€œthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.â€ Heller suggests that â€œlongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of armsâ€ are all valid, as are bans on â€œdangerous and unusual weapons.â€
Thanks to Justice Stevens, we now know that such mitigating language probably would not have made it into the Heller opinion without Kennedyâ€™s intervention.
Kavanaugh, to put it mildly, does not share Kennedyâ€™s trepidation about an overly expansive Second Amendment. Shortly after the Supreme Court decided Heller, the District of Columbia passed a new law banning semi-automatic â€œassault weaponsâ€ and requiring gun owners to register those weapons. That law never reached the Supreme Court, but a lower appeals court did hear a challenge to this new law in a 2011 case called Heller v. District of Columbia (Dick Heller was a party in both Heller cases, hence the similar case names).
In this second Heller case, two judges â€” both of whom are Republican appointees â€” largely upheld the new law (though they did call for further proceedings on the Districtâ€™s gun registration requirement). The third judge was Kavanaugh, and he argued in dissent that â€œboth D.C.â€™s ban on semi-automatic rifles and its gun registration requirement are unconstitutional under Heller.â€
Kavanaugh wants to significantly expand the scope of the Second Amendment
At least until now, the Supreme Courtâ€™s been reluctant to hear Second Amendment cases. The 2008 Heller decision was the first time in American history that the Court held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own a gun. Since then, the Courtâ€™s heard just one significant Second Amendment case, McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010), and that case only held that Heller applies with the same force to the federal government and to the states.
Prior to Heller, the Supreme Court rejected the thesis that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, holding instead that the â€œobvious purposeâ€ of the amendment was â€œthe preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,â€
Yet while the Supreme Courtâ€™s Second Amendment jurisprudence is underdeveloped, the lower courts have reached a consensus on how this amendment should be interpreted. At least 10 federal appeals courts follow what Judge Stephen Higginson described as a â€œtwo-step analytic framework.â€ Under this framework, â€œsevere burdens on core Second Amendment rightsâ€ are subject to â€œstrict scrutiny,â€ the most skeptical level of constitutional review. â€œLess onerous laws, or laws that govern conduct outside of the Second Amendmentâ€™s â€˜coreâ€™â€ face a more permissive test known as â€œintermediate scrutiny.â€
But Kavanaugh rejects this consensus. In his 2011 dissent, he argued for an entirely different framework â€” â€œcourts are to assess gun bans and regulations based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny.â€
One problem with Kavanaughâ€™s framework is that it is far from clear how it would work in practice. Strict scrutiny provides that a law will be struck down unless it advances a â€œcompelling interestâ€ and is â€œnarrowly tailoredâ€ to advance that interest. Intermediate scrutiny provides that a law will be struck down unless it serves â€œimportant governmental objectivesâ€ and is â€œsubstantially related to achievement of those objectives.â€ These tests may seem vague, but theyâ€™ve been around for decades, have been fleshed out by hundreds of court decisions, and are part of the canon of constitutional law taught to first-year law students. Judges are very familiar with these tests, and they know how to apply them to individual cases.
Kavanaughâ€™s framework, by contrast, is novel. And its full implications are unclear. Nevertheless, itâ€™s a safe bet that Kavanaughâ€™s â€œtext, history, and traditionâ€ framework would lead to a much more expansive Second Amendment than the consensus framework, since Kavanaugh dissented to the right of two of his Republican colleagues in the second Heller case.
Liberals best shot in New York State Rifle is to make this case go away
If the Supreme Court reaches the merits of the New York State Rifle case, it is very likely that there will be five votes to significantly expand the scope of the Second Amendment â€” even if there arenâ€™t five votes to adopt Kavanaughâ€™s particular framework.
So thereâ€™s little doubt why New York City changed its gun rules â€” or why the state passed a law that effectively forbids the city from ever reinstating its old rules. New York is dominated by Democrats, and Democrats typically view the Second Amendment very differently than Justice Kavanaugh does. Their best chance to keep the Supreme Court from nuking many gun laws is to render New York State Rifle moot, and thatâ€™s exactly what they did.
New York City changed its rules to allow the New York State Rifle plaintiffs to do what they originally wanted to do. And New York State enacted a law providing that people with premises licenses may bring their gun to â€œanother dwelling or place of business of the licensee where the licensee is authorized to have and possess such pistol or revolver,â€ to â€œan indoor or outdoor shooting range that is authorized by law to operate as such,â€ or to â€œa shooting competition at which the licensee may possess such pistol or revolver consistent withâ€ the law.
Thus far, however, the Court has resisted the cityâ€™s efforts to have the case dismissed as moot. Last October, the Supreme Court considered whether to dismiss New York State Rifle because of its mootness problem. The justices decided instead to put off further discussion of mootness until the December 2 oral arguments.
Some amicus briefs argue that the case should not be dismissed because of a doctrine called â€œvoluntary cessation.â€ As a general rule, this doctrine provides that a court may retain jurisdiction over a case after the defendant voluntarily quits their allegedly illegal behavior. It exists to prevent defendants from avoiding litigation by perpetually stopping their behavior, dismissing any lawsuits against them, and then resuming the same behavior.
Yet, as a brief submitted on behalf of a group of legal scholars argues, New York State Rifle is not a voluntary cessation case. Because the state passed a law forbidding New York City from reinstating its own rules, itâ€™s not possible for the city to resume its allegedly illegal behavior if this case is dismissed.
That leaves Clementâ€™s gambit â€” to simply assert a broader claim before the Supreme Court than the one his clients raised in the lower courts. If New York State Rifle is a grand showdown over whether New York may impose any restrictions on gun possession outside the home, then the case is not moot, and the Supreme Court may use it as a vehicle to expand the Second Amendment.
New York State Rifle, in other words, isnâ€™t just a case about what the Second Amendment means. Itâ€™s a test of whether the Courtâ€™s Republican majority is so impatient to expand that amendment that they will ignore the ordinary rules governing Supreme Court litigation in order to determine the merits of this case."
"More than 200 climate activists brought the annual Yale-Harvard football game to a halt Saturday to protest both universitiesâ€™ investment in fossil fuels.
Carrying a banner reading â€œNobody wins: Yale & Harvard are complicit in climate injustice,â€ students rushed to the 50-yard line and stalled play until police arrived and began arresting them.
At $39.2 billion, Harvardâ€™s endowment is the largest academic fund in the world. It grew 10 percent last year. In 2018, it paid out $1.8 billion in dividends, more than one-third of the universityâ€™s operating budget. Yale isnâ€™t far behind, with an endowment of $29.4 billion. Right now, both schools are invested in businesses that contribute to climate change but are unwilling to disclose just how much.
The activists want their universities to fess up to what theyâ€™re investing in. And if itâ€™s fossil fuels, they want the fund managers to withdraw those investments. Campaigners have been pushing these Ivy League schools to purge their endowments of fossil fuels for years, but this latest effort may be the largest and strongest yet.
The renewed calls for fossil fuel divestment at Harvard and Yale are part of a worldwide movement to confront the fossil fuel industryâ€™s finances, slowly chipping away at the pool of investors willing to bet on coal, oil, and natural gas. Earlier this year, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced a bill to allow federal employees to divest their retirement accounts from fossil fuels.

Divestment is just one front in a recent global surge in climate change activism, much of it led by youth. Children have launched a series of school strikes to demand action on climate change. Young people in the United States are suing the federal government for profiting off of the fossil fuels that cause climate change. The Extinction Rebellion protest that shut down parts of London for weeks this year succeeded in getting the UK Parliament to declare a climate change emergency. Advocates are pushing lawmakers and presidential candidates to endorse ambitious proposals like the Green New Deal or offer their own alternatives.
The divestment movement stands out just for the sheer number of points activists have put on the board. To date, activists say they have secured more than $11 trillion in divestment commitments from more than 1,000 philanthropies, schools, pension funds, and other institutions. In September, the University of California system announced that it would divest from fossil fuels.
But not every institution has been persuaded. Harvard and Yale thus far have been resistant, arguing that divesting is a political action they want to avoid, that fossil fuels will remain an important part of the global economy for years, and that endowments do a better job of changing corporate behavior as investors.
Campaigners insist itâ€™s not just about the melting ice caps or rising sea levels; itâ€™s about solving the fundamental inequity that the people who contributed least to climate change stand to suffer the most â€” the young, the poor, the marginalized.
â€œDivestment is a tactic,â€ said Ilana Cohen, a student in Harvardâ€™s class of 2022 and lead coordinator of the Fossil Free Divest Harvard campaign at Harvard Undergrads for Environmental Justice. â€œJustice is our goal. That requires a larger conversation.â€

And the fact that Yale and Harvard â€” schools that pride themselves on training the next generation of elite society, that backs world-leading climate and clean energy research â€” pays for this work by betting on companies that profit off the destruction of the planet is unconscionable.
â€œIt is immoral for Harvard to be profiting from investments that cause irreversible harm,â€ said Caren Solomon, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who also attended Harvard as an undergrad.
The question now is how long until divestmentâ€™s big dollar numbers start pushing carbon dioxide emissions down. Money talks. So how much does it really say when it walks away?
Thereâ€™s still money to be made in fossil fuels
Scientists warned last year that the window to limit warming this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing. Yet greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil, and natural gas are on the rise. Even the United States, which experienced declining emissions for years, saw an uptick in 2018.
Clearly, there remains a large and growing market for fossil fuels. They remain vital for the global economy and a critical raw material for products like plastics. Much of the technological progress humanity has made to date can be traced to cheap, abundant resources like coal, oil, and natural gas. Our current trajectory has us consuming even more.
â€œThe day after, if we were to divest, weâ€™re still going to turn on the lights,â€ said Harvard President Lawrence Bacow at a forum on fossil fuel divestment. â€œWe would still be dependent on fossil fuels.â€
But Harvard and similar institutions have argued that itâ€™s not about the money. Rather, they argue that divesting from fossil fuels would politicize their portfolios, and they have better ways to fight climate change.
â€œThe Universityâ€™s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,â€ wrote a Harvard spokesman in an email. â€œHarvard is committed to influencing public policy on climate change through scholarship and research.â€
Retaining stakes in fossil fuel companies also gives the school leverage to shape corporate actions, but so far these efforts have been tepid. In the latest report from its Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, the Harvard Management Corporation highlighted how they are pressuring Chevron, one of the worldâ€™s largest oil companies. They considered a proposal that asked Chevron to report on how it could â€œcould adapt its business model to align with a decarbonizing economy.â€
The advisory committee, a 12-member group made up of faculty, students, and alumni, voted uniformly to abstain from the proposal.
â€œThey pointed to the example of tobacco companies that have greatly diversified their businesses, and noted that Chevron might be wise to plan a similar strategy in the coming years,â€ according to the report. â€œNevertheless, in recommending abstention for the proposal, committee members affirmed that such a shift in strategy is properly a business decision for the company rather than a matter for shareholder input.â€
Chevron, not surprisingly, has also made the case that retaining investments in the company is the best way to push them to pursue cleaner energy.
â€œChevron is committed to fostering long-term relationships with shareholders and being responsive to their input on important environmental, social, and governance issues like climate change,â€ a Chevron spokesperson said in an email. â€œThese conversations have reaffirmed our commitment to be the low cost, most efficient producer of ever-cleaner energy to meet the worldâ€™s growing energy demand.â€
Yale University didnâ€™t respond to a request for comment. However, David Swensen, the schoolâ€™s chief investment officer, said last year he doesnâ€™t support fully divesting from fossil fuels on moral grounds.
â€œIf we stopped producing fossil fuels today we would all die. We wouldnâ€™t have food. We wouldnâ€™t have transportation. We wouldnâ€™t have heat. We wouldnâ€™t have air conditioning. We wouldnâ€™t have clothes,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s very nice to protest the fact that we have fossil fuel producers in the portfolio, but the real problem is the consumption, and every one of us in the room is a consumer. I guess itâ€™s a little bit harder to look in the mirror and say â€˜Iâ€™m part of the problemâ€™ as opposed to pointing the finger.â€

Divestment campaigners counter that not being political is, in fact, political. Itâ€™s a statement that not only is the status quo acceptable, itâ€™s beneficial. An investment is an active bet on future growth and by leaving such holdings in place, investors like Yale and Harvard are affirming how they want to the world to be. And a massive global problem like climate change canâ€™t be solved with just research and development â€” it demands a drastic change in business and finance, guided by a pursuit of justice.
Divestment lets climate activists punch above their weight
Most of the worldâ€™s carbon dioxide emissions can be traced to a handful of groups. According to the Carbon Majors Database, 71 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988 can be traced back to just 100 fossil fuel companies.
And much of the worldâ€™s wealth is concentrated in a few hands â€” 26 billionaires control as much wealth as the bottom half of the worldâ€™s population
So divestment serves as a mechanism that lets activists go toe-to-toe with the giants propagating the status quo.
The logic behind divestment is simple: follow the money and cut it off at its source. Apply pressure at the right points, and you can make outsized gains. Thatâ€™s why institutional investors like investment banks, pension funds, and endowments that hold some the largest slices of fossil fuel companies make the ripest targets.
While a handful of people are gatekeepers of these vast reserves of money, they are accountable to their constituencies. In the case of a sovereign wealth fund like Norwayâ€™s $1 trillion oil fund, itâ€™s voters. For a pension fund, itâ€™s the employees that pay into it. And for a universityâ€™s endowment, itâ€™s students, donors, and alumni.
Climate change divestment campaigners are slowly shifting the business case for fossil fuels
Perhaps the most famous application of divestment was the campaign to name and shame companies with financial ties to the apartheid government of South Africa. The campaign started in the 1960s and gradually spread around the world. In the 1980s, the campaign to divest from South Africa surged across college campuses. Former President Obama said the movement was his first brush with political activism.
The apartheid regime eventually fell in 1994. Some economists have questioned whether divestment actually had an impact on the South African economy. But thereâ€™s no question that it drew global attention to the cause and attached a stigma to working for and investing in South Africa, pressuring and isolating its government.
Anti-apartheid campaigner Desmond Tutu has drawn a direct lineage between divesting in apartheid and divesting in fossil fuels.
â€œPeople of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,â€ he wrote in a 2014 column. â€œWe cannot necessarily bankrupt the fossil fuel industry. But we can take steps to reduce its political clout, and hold those who rake in the profits accountable for cleaning up the mess.â€

In the context of climate change, campaigners want big investors to stop buying new stock in fossil fuel companies and phase out their existing equities, stocks, and bonds in these businesses.
The first institutional divestment from fossil fuels likely came in 2012 when Unity College, a 700-student school in rural Maine, announced its trustees were selling off their shares in coal, oil, and gas companies.
Since then, activists have secured trillions of dollars in fossil fuel divestment commitments, making the campaign one of the fastest-growing movements ever.
Bill McKibben, a pioneering fossil fuel divestment campaigner, founder of 350.org, and a Harvard alum, said that thereâ€™s a two-pronged argument here. In addition to the immorality of profiting off the destruction of the planet, the tide is turning against fossil fuels in the market, making them a poor investment.
Several countries have already committed to ending their use of fossil fuels altogether. Cleaner sources of energy are already outcompeting coal, oil, and natural gas in some markets. Renewable energy technology is only getting better and costs are continuing to fall.
All that points to a future with fewer fossil fuels and implies that the current valuations of giants like Exxon Mobil, which has a market capitalization of more than $320 billion, may be overstated.
Commitments to divest from fossil fuels have surged in recent years. Arabella Advisors
â€œWeâ€™ve succeeded in getting across the point we started out to show in 2012: the fossil fuel industry has far more reserves than it can ever hope to burn,â€ McKibben wrote in an email. That means that many of the vast oil and gas fields that have yet to be tapped may never be tapped. As regulations on climate change come into effect and cleaner energy becomes cheaper, these reserves may become stranded assets as the market makes it unprofitable to harness them.
With these factors at play, fossil fuels become less lucrative investments. â€œSince fossil fuel faces a daunting challenge from superior technology it has underperformed the rest of the market badly,â€ McKibben said. â€œSo, for instance, New York State pensioners are $19,000 apiece poorer than they would be had the state divested.â€
Fossil fuel companies themselves are also becoming alarmed about the success of the divestment movement. In a 2017 annual report, Royal Dutch Shell warned that the campaign could have â€œa material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.â€
And with a smaller pool of investors, itâ€™s likely that fossil fuel companies would struggle to finance new drilling rigs, refineries, or pipelines.
Itâ€™s not just about solving an environmental problem. Divestment is about correcting a catastrophic injustice.
For investors, whether or not fossil fuels will remain profitable may end up being the biggest factor a decision to divest. Within the financial sector, thereâ€™s a growing push for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria to be included in evaluating investments. The idea is that ethical concerns, especially around the environment, do present a material investment risk. That could come in the form of exacerbated extreme weather harms to business operations or a damaged reputation for relying on dirty energy.
However, itâ€™s the moral case thatâ€™s motivating activists, particularly students.
And at some of the most elite institutions in the world, students see a yawning gap between the world they want to see and the world that universities are betting on.
Activists say that to truly fight climate change, schools need to detach their fortunes from the success and growth of dirty energy. But they also have to take active steps to address the fundamental inequities of climate change, that the people who contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most.
That could mean seeking out investments in communities vulnerable to problems like sea level rise. Or it could mean targeting development in historically marginalized areas. Or making sure that solar panels are not just luxury accoutrements but a meaningful way to help people with low incomes pay their power bills.
At both Harvard and Yale, campaigners have tied their fossil fuel divestment push to debt relief for Puerto Rico. The island was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and much of the destruction was worsened by rising ocean and air temperatures. But Yale holds debt bonds in the islandâ€™s economy.

â€œPuerto Ricoâ€™s debt crisis is a major climate justice issue,â€ said Nora Heaphy, a Yale student in the class of 2021 and a divestment activist. â€œ[Yale] is actually suing Puerto Rico to be repaid before any rebuilding can take place.â€
So divestment is not simply about the future impacts of climate change; itâ€™s about the inequities already here.
Divestment isnâ€™t moving the needle â€” yet â€” but itâ€™s changing the conversation
Despite gains in divestment, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Some fossil fuel companies are indeed struggling, particularly coal mining firms. But others are still making tons of money. Exxon Mobil generated $279 billion in revenue in 2018. Shell made $388.4 billion. BP made $303.7 billion. Aramco made $355.9 billion.
Analysts agree that the $8 trillion thatâ€™s been divested or pledged to withdraw to date from fossil fuels is still a small slice of the overall share of the $100 trillion-plus global capital market. â€œAt present, [divestment] has had a pretty minimal impact on the industry,â€ said Richard Taylor, an oil and gas industry analyst at Fitch Solutions.
However, environmental, social, and governance criteria demanded by investors are forcing fossil fuel companies to confront the impact of their contributions to climate change. That in turn is changing how they talk about the environment and making them more proactive about the regulatory risks and the need to come up with solutions.
Still, the overall market impacts are minimal because the amount of money floating around right now is so vast and the inertia is immense. â€œThey arenâ€™t changing their behavior, thatâ€™s for sure,â€ said John Thieroff at Moodyâ€™s Investors Service. â€œLike it or not, weâ€™re going to continue to consume oil and gas for while. Thereâ€™s no switch thatâ€™s going to get flipped in the next year or two thatâ€™s going to let us walk away from oil.â€
However, divestment is definitely affecting the reputations of fossil fuel companies and their investors. Public opinion is already slanted against fossil fuels and in favor of cleaner energy. Companies like Exxon and Shell have responded by publicly backing proposals to tax carbon dioxide emissions.
Thereâ€™s now a nascent movement within some major companies for divestment. More than 7,000 Amazon employees signed a letter this year to adopt a company-wide plan to deal with climate change and to sever its ties with oil and gas companies.
â€œThese things are slow-moving,â€ said Taylor. â€œThese are generation-long movements and dynamics.â€
But the world does not have the luxury of waiting. Scientists have warned that the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by as soon as 2030 if the aim is to limit warming to just 1.5 degrees Celsius this century. So one of our defining actions on climate change where we invest: a future that continues on our current trajectory or one thatâ€™s cleaner, greener, and more just.

"This is part one of a four-part series on carbon capture and utilization (CCU), the growing industry dedicated to using carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere to fight climate change. Part two is about enhanced oil recovery as a use of CO2, and part three is about other industrial uses of CO2. The fourth post will look at how policymakers should approach CCU technologies. This piece was originally published in September.
Scientists generally estimate that to hold the rise in global average temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius over the preindustrial baseline â€” a â€œsafeâ€ level of warming â€” humanity must stabilize the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide at around 350 parts per million.
This year, we reached about 410 ppm. There is already too much CO2 in the atmosphere. At this point, to truly vouchsafe a secure climate for future generations, we donâ€™t just have to reduce emissions; we have to pull some CO2 out of the atmosphere.
Given that global carbon emissions are still rising and there are hundreds of gigatons on the way from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, almost every model used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that shows us reaching a safe climate involves burying gigatons of CO2, so-called â€œnegative emissions.â€
There are many forms of negative emissions, but most likely the only way to remove enough CO2 will be to pull it directly out of the air and bury it underground in saline aquifers, a process known as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). With CCS, CO2 is treated as a waste product that has to be disposed of properly, just as we treat sewage and so many other pollution hazards.
How much CO2 will need to be buried? Obviously, itâ€™s impossible to know in advance; IPCC models vary in how fast they show emissions falling. The faster and sooner emissions fall, the less CCS will be necessary. The slower and later they fall, the more that will be needed.
A 2017 paper in Nature Climate Change estimates the total â€œmitigation burdenâ€ â€” that is the total amount of emissions that need to be avoided between now and 2050 to stay under 2 degrees â€” at 800 gigatons. (Though the IPCC says 1.5 degrees is the truly safe target, many scientists believe itâ€™s unachievable; 2 degrees remains an extremely ambitious target.) The paper estimates that even if emission reductions are successful, between 120â€“160 gigatons will need to be sequestered during that period.
Another way of saying that is, even given optimistic assumptions about decarbonization, weâ€™ll probably end up emitting a lot more than our carbon budget, so weâ€™ll need to bury between 100 and 200 gigatons of CO2 to get back within it. And, of course, weâ€™ll have to bury hundreds of gigatons more in the years after 2050.
1.5 and 2 degree emission scenarios; everything after emissions dip under zero at mid-century is negative emissions. Oil Change International
To give a sense of scale, that means by 2030 humanity needs to be compressing, transporting, and burying an amount of CO2, by volume, that is two to four times the amount of fluids that the global oil and gas industry deals with today. To build an industry of that scale, by that date, we need to begin today, with large-scale research and deployment. The price of capturing CO2 from the air needs to be driven down quickly.
But thereâ€™s a problem: Burying CO2 has no short-term economic benefits. In the absence of a fairly stiff price on carbon, meant to put a value on its long-term benefits, CCS doesnâ€™t pencil out. Thereâ€™s no incentive for companies to do it and thus no incentive to get better at carbon capture.
The easy solution to this dilemma would be a global price on carbon, but that doesnâ€™t appear to be happening. So how, in the absence of a carbon price, can the carbon capture industry get going?
Hereâ€™s one idea: For a while at least, rather than burying the carbon, the companies capturing it could sell it.
Utilizing CO2 could provide a push for carbon capture
Carbon dioxide is a commodity with some value. It is used, both directly and as a feedstock, by a range of industries and has been for over a century.
Most CO2 used by industries today is a byproduct of fossil fuel processes, often from natural gas or coal-fueled plants making ammonia; that is it comes from below the Earthâ€™s surface. Just like burning fossil fuels, it transfers CO2 from the geosphere to the atmosphere.
But if CO2 pulled out of the air became more plentiful and cheaper, it could begin competing with terrestrial CO2. In theory, any industry that uses carbon from under the ground â€” for fuel, beverages, directly in industrial processes, as a feedstock to create other products, or whatever â€” could switch to air-captured CO2.
Using CO2 from the air for products and services is known as carbon capture and utilization (CCU). By some estimates, itâ€™s a potentially $1 trillion market by 2030. And it could have two broad benefits.
First, it could reduce CO2 emissions, in part by sequestering some carbon permanently in durable products and in part by substituting for carbon-intensive processes, thus avoiding emissions that would have otherwise occurred.
To be clear, CCU will never reduce enough CO2 to avoid the need for CCS (i.e., burying carbon). Not even close. The tonnage of CO2 humanity emits simply dwarfs the tonnage of carbon-based products it consumes.
But CCU could be a helpful tool in the decarbonization tool belt. As one recent paper put it, â€œEach atom of C we can recycle is an atom of fossil carbon left in the underground for next generations that will not reach the atmosphere today.â€ By one optimistic estimate, CCU could reduce up to 10 percent of total global emissions by 2030.
Second, demand for CO2 driven by CCU could provide early market pull, helping to get carbon capture technology scaled up and its costs pushed down, so that it is ready when policymakers finally get around to supporting CCS in earnest. It could serve as an â€œon rampâ€ to CCS.
A guide to the complex and confusing world of carbon utilization
This is a hot and rapidly developing area in the climate and energy world. There are all sorts of research going on into novel uses of CO2, all sorts of pilot projects underway, all sorts of startups popping up, and all sorts of confusing information and hype floating around. So letâ€™s see if we can sort it out.
Hereâ€™s how this series of posts will go. In this post, weâ€™ll take a brief look at the two major sources of industrial carbon capture and the basic ways CO2 is currently used by industry, just to get oriented.
In the second post, we will discuss the vexed subject of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is by far the largest current industrial use of CO2.
In the third post, we will take a closer look at the top non-EOR markets for CO2, like building materials and fuels, and their total potential, in both economic and carbon terms.
And in the final post, weâ€™ll contemplate the road forward for CCU, what kinds of supportive policies it requires, and, taking a step back, the right way to see it in the overall context of the climate fight.
Itâ€™s going to be fun! Youâ€™ll never see CO2 quite the same way again.
Varieties of carbon capture
First, letâ€™s get clear on what I mean when I talk about standing up an industrial carbon capture industry.
A wide variety of â€œnaturalâ€ processes absorb and sequester carbon, on land (forests and soil), on the coasts (wetlands and mangroves), and in the ocean. The carbon-absorbing capacity of those processes can be enhanced with clever human management â€” e.g., the US Geological Serviceâ€™s LandCarbon program â€” and they can play a large role in the climate fight.
But in these posts, we will instead be discussing industrial carbon capture, machines built to absorb CO2 from the air via chemical reactions. We wonâ€™t get into the various chemistries and technologies involved (there are many, and they are complicated), but it is worth keeping in mind one distinction.
CO2 can either be pulled out of flue gases â€” waste streams produced by power generation or other industrial processes â€” or it can be pulled out of the ambient air through a process known as direct air capture (DAC). Each has its advantages and disadvantages.
A direct air capture machine (or at least an artistâ€™s rendering). Carbon Engineering
The great advantage of drawing from flue gases is that the CO2 is concentrated, roughly one molecule out of every 10, whereas in the ambient air, it is one molecule out of every 2,500. With the laws of chemistry being what they are, itâ€™s always going to require less energy to draw a material from an already-concentrated source. On a raw commodity price basis, CO2 from flue gases will likely always be cheaper than CO2 produced by DAC.
But DAC has advantages of its own. First, it is geographically agnostic. It does not need to be attached to anything or built in any particular place. CO2 is equally concentrated in the air everywhere in the world, so DAC can be built anywhere in the world, wherever the CO2 is needed, eliminating transportation costs. It is smaller, more modular, and more adaptable.
Second, unlike every other form of carbon capture, terrestrial or industrial, DAC is limited only by costs. It can scale up to any size, depending only on our willingness to spend money on it. Thatâ€™s why many in the field believe DAC to be the most promising negative-emissions technology in the long term.
(NB: there are companies like Global Thermostat with technologies they claim can capture carbon from either source.)
As we will see, various options for CCU may be better suited to one form of capture or the other.
The use of CO2 and its potential
With all that background, letâ€™s have a look at the ways CO2 is currently used.
Hereâ€™s a graphic from the UKâ€™s Royal Society that lays out the basic options:
Royal Society
Starting at the bottom: CO2 can be used directly, in greenhouses, to carbonate beverages, or for enhanced oil recovery (the largest current use), or it can be transformed, via a wide variety of chemical processes, into materials or feedstocks. One of the chemical conversions with the biggest potential, up at the top, is combining CO2 with hydrogen to make synthetic hydrocarbon fuels.
This graphic from the University of Michiganâ€™s Global CO2 Initiative gets a little more granular about the resulting products:
Some of these processes and products are further along in market development than others; some have larger carbon mitigation potential than others; some have larger total market potential than others. (Weâ€™ll look at all of that more closely in the third post.)
One distinction to keep in mind for now has to do with how long each of these options sequesters CO2.
For most of them, itâ€™s a relatively short time. For instance, if captured CO2 is used to make synthetic fuels, the fuels are then burned, at which point the CO2 is released back into the atmosphere. Itâ€™s carbon recycling (or upcycling), not carbon sequestration.
Enhanced oil recovery can be done in concert with permanent geological carbon sequestration, but it rarely is today. (Weâ€™ll look at that more closely in the second post.)
Of the various other categories of CCU, only construction materials (and possibly new materials like carbon fiber) can claim to sequester CO2 semi-permanently. When you inject CO2 into concrete, the concrete is then used in a building which could last up to a century; then, if the building comes down, the concrete can be broken up and re-used. The CO2 stays put, chemically bonded.
This distinction matters in contemplating the total mitigation potential of CCU. Only a small slice of it can ever claim to be carbon-negative; its sequestration potential is limited. For the most part, its benefit will come from replacing carbon-intensive processes with carbon-neutral ones, avoiding carbon emissions. (And even that potential may be limited; more on that in the fourth post.)
All this means, again, that CCU will never substitute for CCS. At best it will help lay the foundation for CCS.
In its landmark 2016 roadmap for CCU industries, the Global CO2 Initiative was extremely bullish on CCUâ€™s mitigation potential, arguing it could substantially assist in hitting Paris climate targets.
GCI
It is worth noting that these optimistic projections are not universally shared; the roadmapâ€™s estimate of mitigation potential is at the high end of recent studies. A 2005 IPCC assessment concluded gloomily that â€œthe scale of the use of captured CO2 in industrial processes is too small, the storage times too short, and the energy balance too unfavourable for industrial uses of CO2 to become significant as a means of mitigating climate change.â€
Still, a lot has changed since 2005. Renewable energy has gotten cheaper and CO2 conversion has improved. At the very least, CCU is one of many potentially carbon abating technologies that deserves much more attention and support than it is currently getting from policymakers.
Politics do not exactly encourage long-term thinking, but 2050 isnâ€™t that far away, and 2030 is closer still. Holding temperature â€œwell belowâ€ 2 degrees, the UN goal, does not just mean reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, as most of the Democratic candidates for president now support. It also means building the capacity to bury hundreds of gigatons of carbon. Insofar as CCU can help get that going â€” an open question, for now â€” it is worth pursuing.
In part two, we will take a closer look at enhanced oil recovery, the dominant current use of CO2. On one hand, it uses infrastructure that could easily be repurposed for carbon sequestration in areas that tend to be suitable for carbon sequestration. On the other hand, it empowers oil companies. We shall grapple with that dilemma."
"The most common interpretation of US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondlandâ€™s impeachment testimony this week is that Sondland turned on the president, finally spilling what he knew about the Trump-Ukraine scandal.
And on the surface, Sondlandâ€™s testimony indeed looked bad for Trump. He confirmed the first quid pro quo (investigations for a White House meeting). He said he believed himself to be carrying out the presidentâ€™s orders. And he gave new details implicating other top administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence.
Yet when it comes to a crucial topic â€” what President Trump actually told Sondland about all this â€” Sondlandâ€™s memory continues to fail him.
Sondland claims to have a clear recollection of only one phone call with Trump related to Ukraine, toward the end of this saga, on September 9, in which Trump said, he wanted â€œnothingâ€ and wanted â€œno quid pro quo.â€ Trump himself seized on this Wednesday, writing out Sondlandâ€™s account of this call in block letters and shouting it out to the White House press corps, insisting it gets him off the hook.
However, other witnesses and documents suggest there were several other calls between Sondland and Trump prior to the September 9 call â€” including just days before the 9th, after news broke that Trump was blocking military aid to Ukraine. Those other calls have a very different takeaway, and one thatâ€™s far more damaging to Trump.
Bill Taylor claimed Sondland spoke of such a call with Trump on September 1, and Tim Morrison said Sondland spoke of a new call on September 7. Both said that, per Sondland, Trump was adamant the Ukrainians make the statement about investigations. That is: he very much wanted something, not nothing.
Sondland professed not to remember the details of this â€” and claims he canâ€™t even remember whether those calls with Trump even happened. (He blames the White Houseâ€™s failure to turn over call records for this.)
Regardless, there appear to be holes in his story â€” ones that raise the possibility that he is still crafting his testimony to protect President Trump.
Sondlandâ€™s goal Wednesday was clearly to get the heat off himself â€” he was widely viewed as the least credible of the closed-door witnesses, and some Democrats even said he may have perjured himself. He seems to have succeeded in that. But he seems to have done so by offering up new details implicating basically everyone except Trump.
Sondland denies knowing that Burisma meant Biden. Thatâ€™s ... questionable.
Before getting to Sondlandâ€™s testimony about his contacts with the president, itâ€™s worth examining a separate dubious claim he continues to insist on.
Sondland claims that, through most of this months-long saga, he was completely unaware that the gas company Burisma had any connection to the Biden family â€” and, therefore, that investigating Burisma could be interpreted as investigating the Bidens.
In his deposition, Sondland testified that he only learned â€œvery much laterâ€ of the Biden-Burisma connection. And in his open testimony, Sondland reiterated that he â€œnever heardâ€ Vice President Joe Bidenâ€™s name come up, and he only realized Burisma meant Biden at some unspecified moment â€œvery late in the game.â€
â€œI canâ€™t remember when the light bulb went on. It could have been when the transcript went out. It was always â€˜Burismaâ€™ to me,â€ Sondland said.
This claim always seemed hard to believe. For one, Rudy Giuliani had repeatedly mentioned the Burisma-Biden tie in media appearances and tweets that year â€” he talked about it constantly. Yet Sondland testified he had completely missed all of Giulianiâ€™s media appearances, and that when he talked to Giuliani, only â€œBurismaâ€ (not â€œBidenâ€) was discussed.
President Trump, too, we know, blatantly framed investigating Burisma as investigating the Bidens during his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky.
Sondland also was not on that call, so he wouldnâ€™t have heard that. Yet Sondland phoned Trump the morning of the call (July 25), and the day after the call (July 26), to discuss it. (Sondland testified he couldnâ€™t remember what he talked to Trump about on the first call, and that his memory of the second call was only jogged by another witnessâ€™s testimony.)
Sondland also met with Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak the day after the call. It would be rather strange if the word â€œBidenâ€ never came up in any of these interactions.
Beyond that, two witnesses have testified that, in separate instances in July, they heard Sondland specifically mention investigating â€œBiden.â€
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an NSC staffer, testified that after a White House meeting with Ukrainian officials on July 10, Sondland â€œemphasized the importance of Ukraine delivering the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma.â€ Vindman said he told Sondland this was inappropriate.
David Holmes, a Kyiv-based State Department official, testified that when he was having lunch with Sondland at a restaurant on July 26, Sondland called Trump. Afterward, Holmes says he asked whether Trump cared about Ukraine, and Sondland said Trump only cared about â€œbig stuffâ€ that benefits him, â€˜like the â€˜Biden investigationâ€™ that Mr. Giuliani was pushing.â€
Finally, during her own testimony on Thursday, former NSC staffer Fiona Hill was asked whether Sondland could really have been ignorant of the Burisma-Biden connection. â€œIt is not credible that he was oblivious,â€ she said.
The weight of evidence, other witness testimony, and simple common sense contradicts Sondlandâ€™s account here. And if he is still not being fully forthcoming on this topic â€” what else might he be continuing to hide?
Sondland canâ€™t remember calls with Trump during the most important period of the scandal
In Sondlandâ€™s testimony, he openly confirmed that there was a â€œquid pro quoâ€ offered to Ukraine: Zelensky would get the White House meeting he badly wanted, as long as the Ukrainians publicly announced investigations.
Yet that was only the first quid pro quo at the heart of this scandal. Sondlandâ€™s account of the second and even more scandalous quid pro quo â€” releasing hundreds of millions of dollars in blocked military aid for Ukraine, in exchange for Ukrainians â€” is far murkier.
Itâ€™s important to understand the timeline here. Trump ordered the aid blocked back in July. However, witnesses have suggested, and documents have corroborated, that through July and August, discussions with the Ukrainians did indeed focus on the White House meeting for Zelensky, and not yet the blocked aid.
That all changed on August 28, when news that Trump was blocking the aid became public. The Ukrainians panicked. â€œNeed to talk to you,â€ Yermak wrote to US special representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker in a text message.
On September 1, Vice President Mike Pence met with Zelensky in Warsaw. Shortly after that meeting, Sondland now admits, he told Yermak that the military aid likely depended on whether the Ukrainians announced the investigations Trump wanted.
But why did Sondland do this? His latest testimony is that he simply â€œpresumed,â€ on his own, that there was a linkage. That no one else, and certainly not President Trump, ever told him any such thing. (â€œI donâ€™t recall President Trump ever talking to me about any security assistance. Ever,â€ Sondland testified.)
That same day, Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Kyiv, asked Sondland whether they are â€œnow saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?â€ And Sondland responded, â€œCall me.â€
Now â€”with bolding for emphasis â€” this is Bill Taylorâ€™s account of what Sondland then told him on that call.
During that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
Ambassador Sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling Ukrainian officials that only a White House meeting with Presidnet Zelensky was dependent on a public announcement of investigations â€” in fact, Ambassador Sondland said, â€˜everythingâ€™ was dependent on such an announcement, including assistance. He said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky â€˜in a public boxâ€™ by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.
That is: Sondland claimed, according to Taylorâ€™s account, that he was linking military aid to an investigation statement because of what President Trump told him. Not because of something he simply presumed.
Taylor isnâ€™t the only witness to give an account like this. Fast forward a few days later to September 7. NSC staffer Tim Morrison testified that Sondland claimed to have spoken with President Trump again about this. This is from Morrisonâ€™s deposition, with bolding added for emphasis.
[In] the September 7th phone call, he told me he had just gotten off the phone with the President. I remember this because he actually made the comment that it was easier for him to get a hold of the President than to get a hold of me, which led me to respond, â€˜Well, the President doesnâ€™t work for Ambassador Bolton; I do,â€™ to which Ambassador Sondland responded, â€˜Does Ambassador Bolton know that?â€™ But thatâ€™s why I have a vivid recollection of this. And he wanted to tell me what he had discussed with the President.
... He told me... that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it.
Again: This isnâ€™t â€œI want nothing!â€ Itâ€™s the opposite. Itâ€™s: â€œPresident Zelensky must announce the opening of the investigations.â€
On the next day, September 8, Sondland texted Taylor and Volker, and again claimed to have spoken with Trump.
Gordon Sondland: Guys, multiple convos with Ze, Potus. Lets talk
Taylor testified that they did soon talk, and that Sondland described what sounds like the same Trump instruction that Sondland told Morrison about.
Ambassador Sondland and I spoke on the phone. He confirmed that he had talked to President Trump as I had suggested a week earlier, but that President Trump was adamant that President Zelensky, himself, had to â€˜clear things up and do it in public.â€™ President Trump said it was not a â€˜quid pro quo.â€™
...Ambassador Sondland also said that he had talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not â€˜clear things upâ€™ in public, we would be at a â€˜stalemateâ€™ I understood a â€˜stalemateâ€™ to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance. Ambassador Sondland said that this conversation concluded with President Zelensky agreeing to make a public statement in an interview on CNN.
Again: Here, though Trump claims heâ€™s not asking for a quid pro quo, he is not saying â€œI want nothing,â€ instead, he is â€œadamantâ€ that Zelensky make the announcement.
But Sondland claims not to remember any of these conversations with Trump he claimed, at the time, to have had. Perhaps tellingly, though, he did include this bit in his â€œaddendum,â€ updating his initial closed-door testimony:
Finally, as of this writing, I cannot specifically recall if I had one or two phone calls with President Trump in the September 6-9 time frame.
And as another reminder: Sondland testified that he doesnâ€™t recall â€œPresident Trump ever talking to me about any security assistance.â€ His testimony is that even when, after the news of the aid holdup had leaked and the Ukrainians were desperate to get it lifted, the topic never even came up between him and Trump.
Sondlandâ€™s account of the one call with Trump he does claim to remember is very strange
Continuing in the timeline, itâ€™s on September 9 â€” the day after Sondland texted Taylor about â€œmultiple convos with Ze, Potusâ€ and described a conversation with Trump â€” that Sondland finally remembers speaking to Trump.
This is the day Taylor sent the now-infamous text: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaignâ€ â€” a text that took Sondland four-and-a-half hours to respond to.
After receiving that text, Sondland says, he called Trump. And this is his account of the conversation â€” the account Trump repeated with such relish on Wednesday:
I said, What do you want from Ukraine? I may have even used a four-letter word.
And he said I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I just want Zelensky to do the right thing, what he ran on, or words to that effect
After this, Sondland texted Taylor:
Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trumpâ€™s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quoâ€™s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.
But does Sondlandâ€™s account of his call with Trump really make sense?
Remember â€” other documents and witnesses suggest Sondland had talked with Trump about this topic more than once in the days before this. Sondland even talked to President Zelensky about this. He was trying to close a deal.

Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.
So, why would Sondland open this call to Trump so late in the process with the broad question: â€œWhat do you want from Ukraine?â€ Itâ€™s ... strange. Especially when Taylor and Morrison claim that, days before this, Sondland claimed to be perfectly clear on what Trump wanted (that he was â€œadamantâ€ on an announcement from the Ukrainians, that he wanted Zelensky â€œin a public box,â€ etc.)
But Sondland says he can only recall Trump saying, â€œI want nothing.â€ And, more vaguely, that he wants Zelensky to â€œdo the right thing.â€
Interestingly, while other administration officials have disputed aspects of Sondlandâ€™s testimony, Trump himself has refrained from attacking him too aggressively. Instead, he insisted that Sondlandâ€™s testimony was â€œfantasticâ€ for him. And maybe thereâ€™s a reason for that."
"Itâ€™s been over 20 years since the first PokÃ©mon games arrived, and kids who grew up with those games â€” and are now adults â€” remain fans today. But unlike similar kid-friendly franchises like Star Wars, which has attempted to age alongside its audience, PokÃ©mon is still designed primarily with kids in mind.
That kids-first mentality hasnâ€™t kept adult fans from sticking with PokÃ©mon games, as evidenced by the massive, across-all-ages popularity of PokÃ©mon Go, the mobile phone phenomenon that had people wandering the streets chasing virtual critters in 2016. But it is harder for grown ups to find satisfaction in completing games that are designed for 9-year-olds, in the way that Tic-Tac-Toe gets dull after a while. And so dedicated adult fans of PokÃ©mon came up with a solution to make PokÃ©mon games a bit more difficult to complete, and even a little bit heartbreaking: The Nuzlocke Challenge.

Trying to Nuzlocke Pokemon Sword and Shield nearly broke me
Almost every major PokÃ©mon game works the same way: Players travel a wide-open map of a world similar to our own, collecting dozens of adorable pocket monsters â€” like the ever-present Pikachu. Those monsters battle other monsters, become stronger, and learn more offensive and defensive moves to aid them in battle. If they take too much damage, playersâ€™ PokÃ©mon can faint, rendering them unable to fight. This is the worst possible thing that can happen to a PokÃ©mon. They canâ€™t die, and are easily revived via healing potions or by bringing them to a nearby PokÃ©mon Center (the in-game version of a hospital). The goal is to become the best PokÃ©mon master in the land, defeating every rival trainer.
Thereâ€™s not much challenge in these games and very little in the way of stakes. Every battle makes playersâ€™ PokÃ©mon slightly stronger until nothing really poses a threat. Kids get enjoyment out of simply building out their rosters â€” catching â€˜em all, if you will â€” and conquering the various tests of strength held by other PokÃ©mon trainers throughout the land. While PokÃ©mon does have its share of drama, none of its action is a matter of life or death.
Some adults who remain fans of PokÃ©mon games may find similar satisfaction as the kids, but for many, the lack of difficulty or greater purpose makes the games less interesting than what they remember playing as kids.
So one adult came up with a way to give PokÃ©mon a much higher, more unique level of challenge.
Nick Franco is an artist based in Los Angeles. Back in 2010, he was studying at UC Santa Cruz, when he realized he had become bored with one of his favorite PokÃ©mon games, PokÃ©mon Ruby, which had been released seven years prior. To make things more interesting and recapture his love for the game, he imposed some rules on himself:
1. He could only collect the first PokÃ©mon he encountered in each new area.
2. If a PokÃ©mon fainted, he would consider it â€œdeadâ€ and release it back into the wild, never to be seen again.
Later, he added a third rule:
3. Every PokÃ©mon caught must be given a unique nickname.
These three rules seem simple, but they fundamentally change the way PokÃ©mon is played. Rather than encouraging him to amass an infinite selection of undying critters, these rules forced Franco to use a very limited supply of very mortal PokÃ©mon. And because of the added nicknames, each narrow victory and shocking death of his select crew was far more emotionally powerful.
Losing a PokÃ©mon in this manner can feel a lot like Simba watching Mufasa die at his brotherâ€™s hand in The Lion King. Nick Francoâ€™s PokÃ©mon Hard-Mode webcomic
Franco documented his quest in webcomic that he originally called â€œPokÃ©mon: Hard-Mode,â€ but fans started referring to his rules as the Nuzlocke Challenge. (The origins of the name are a bizarre amalgam of Nuzleaf, a small, leafy PokÃ©mon, and the character John Locke from the television show Lost. Try not to get too hung up on the name; it makes very little sense to anyone, even fans.)
Francoâ€™s rules have since become massively popular with older PokÃ©mon fans, inspiring a number of players to perform their own Nuzlocke runs in various PokÃ©mon games. The phenomenon has become a hit on YouTube, where aspiring players record and document their adventures, highlighting every devastating death of their named buddies. This all came as a pleasant surprise to Franco. â€œI was just trying to make someone laugh at stupid comic,â€ he told Vox in a phone interview. â€œI didnâ€™t want to make some big thing.â€
Jaiden Animations, a channel with more than 7 million subscribers, recently published a video called â€œI Attempted my First Pokemon Nuzlocke,â€ which perfectly captures the highs and lows of the challenge. The host of the channel, who goes by Jaiden, details her adventure from the beginning of the 2003 video game PokÃ©mon Ruby, selecting the fiery chicken, Torchic, as her first companion monster and naming it Teriyaki. Sheâ€™s later joined by the acorn-shaped Seedot, naming it Corn.
In a normal PokÃ©mon run, Teriyaki the Torchic and Corn the Seedot would probably stick with Jaiden until the end of the adventure, getting progressively stronger. At some point maybe theyâ€™d accidentally faint after taking too much damage, but no biggie â€” they could just be revived.
But hereâ€™s what happened in Jaidenâ€™s Nuzlocke run:
More than halfway through her adventure, she went out into the wild to train up her team and, as she says in her video, â€œthe worst happened.â€ An unfortunate string of luck resulted in Corn (now an evolved Nuzleaf) dying to the racoon-like Zigzagoonâ€™s Pin Missile attack. Jaiden actually includes her live audio from the moment it happened, and you can hear the desperation in her voice as Cornâ€™s health quickly dissolves to nothing: â€œWait, wait, no no no, no no no, stop, STOP! [voice crack] STOP! Corn!â€
Corn was gone. Forever.

The PokÃ©mon series has always been about forming lifelong bonds with the creatures you find. As a kid, itâ€™s easy to make these connections. The first PokÃ©mon game you play is so new that you become instantly attached to the first Pidgey (â€œBirdoâ€) or Rattata (â€œMr. Ratâ€) that comes your way. Twenty years later, maybe you still have Pidgey wallpaper on your computer or a Rattata phone case. They can leave that much of a mark.
But when picking up a new PokÃ©mon game (like the just-released PokÃ©mon Sword and Shield), itâ€™s hard to get that same rush. The same connection that you first felt to Birdo and Mr. Rat just isnâ€™t there for the random new creatures you come across, like the ball-shaped sheep Wooloo. Youâ€™re an adult now, and youâ€™ve seen hundreds of these critters over the years. What makes these new ones special?
The Nuzlocke Challenge is a way to revive that feeling by making these new connections as transient and capricious as life itself. The threat of losing them forever is enough to make an indelible mark on your soul. And 20 years down the road, maybe itâ€™ll be Wooloo â€” permanently felled by an unexpected Earthquake attack in Dappled Grove â€” decorating your iPhone 38. I see no more fitting memorial.

"In the spring of 2019, a flurry of headlines sprang up around the blockbuster hit Avengers: Endgame, insisting that the film featured the first openly gay character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
When these headlines first appeared, I was confused. I didnâ€™t remember a scene where Captain Marvel kissed a girl (and liked it) or a scene where Groot declared that he only liked boy trees or a scene where Captain America turned his chair around to remind kids that gender isnâ€™t binary. But reading the details revealed that, sure, Endgame featured the MCUâ€™s first openly gay character. He just didnâ€™t have a name or a personality, and he appeared in one scene.
Dubbed the â€œGrieving Manâ€ and played by director Joe Russo, the character turns up early in the film, at a support group attended by Captain America. The entirety of Grieving Manâ€™s character is: He lost someone in the Thanos snap that eliminated half of all life in the universe, and after working his way through the ensuing grief, heâ€™s started dating again. He explicitly says heâ€™s dating a man.
This is all well and good, honestly. If youâ€™re going to use a random peripheral character to illustrate how the world is struggling to get past this traumatic event, why not a gay guy? But the triumphalism around the â€œfirst openly gay characterâ€ headlines irked me and plenty of others. â€œFirst openly gay characterâ€ doesnâ€™t imply â€œrandom peripheral character.â€ It implies someone who at least has a name.
This is often the way these things go when it comes to Disney and its many subsidiaries. The company dominates the entertainment press because the 2010s have proved especially fruitful for two specific types of stories in the entertainment press: stories that tease major developments in new projects based on major pieces of intellectual property (Marvel, Star Wars, Disney animation, etc.), and stories that suggest important progress has been made in terms of representation both in front of and behind the camera.
Thatâ€™s how we end up with headlines like the â€œfirst openly gay characterâ€ ones, or the ones that confirmed Lefou was gay in the 2017 Beauty and the Beast â€” technically, what these headlines say is true, and the milestones they celebrate seem like a big deal. But they really, really arenâ€™t. They reflect onscreen representation where the fine print contains â€œsome assembly required,â€ because it merely nods to queer subtext and asks you to go digging around for it. The works themselves chicken out of doing anything meaningful, in favor of winking at you and nudging you in the ribs, daring you to read queerness into properties where none exists.
Anyway, Elsa from Frozen is queer, and I can prove it. Just donâ€™t ask Disney to check my math.
Based on Frozen, a bunch of people decided Elsa was a queer character. Mostly sheâ€™s just not explicitly straight. Good enough!
Elsa meets a lil salamander who seems rife with merchandising potential, just like all of her friends are. Disney
Before we go much further, I should warn you that there are a bunch of spoilers below for both Frozen (the 2013 Disney film that dominated the box office, won two Oscars, and unleashed â€œLet It Goâ€ upon an unsuspecting nation of parents) and Frozen 2 â€” so if spoilers concern you, bookmark this story for after youâ€™ve seen the movies and retreat to your ice palace until then. If youâ€™re (ahem) â€œcoolâ€ with spoilers, letâ€™s proceed.
Canonically, Elsa of Arendelle, who sits upon the tiny northern kingdomâ€™s throne at the end of Frozen, is not queer. Canonically, she is not romantically interested in anybody. And lest you wonder if that description means Elsa is asexual or aromantic, neither of those qualities is canon either. Canonically, sheâ€™s nothing when it comes to her sexuality.
Which also means she isnâ€™t (yet) canonically straight.
Elsaâ€™s characterization stands in direct opposition to that of her younger sister, Anna, who is so hungry for love and affection (after essentially growing up without either in a big, empty palace) that she throws herself at the first guy who glances at her, the small-time prince Hans. He turns out to be the first movieâ€™s villain, a twist that is cool the first time you see it, and then makes less and less sense the more you think about it.
Annaâ€™s big arc in that first movie involves learning about the nature of true love and that itâ€™s the result of time and effort, that a relationship between two sisters whoâ€™ve known each other for years and years is more likely to qualify as true love than anything having to do with some guy youâ€™ve just met.
A lot of Disney movies might have given Elsa a guy to fall for, too. In fact, if we look at Frozen as a classical Broadway musical (the form it resembles even more than a Disney princess movie â€” indeed it would eventually be adapted basically as is for the stage), then a secondary romance is all but required. In a more traditional version of this story, the darker love triangle among Anna and the two guys vying for her heart would be counterbalanced by a lighter love triangle with Elsa at its center.
Instead, Elsa has no love interests. Her lack of suitors could be a function of the first movieâ€™s rushed production process, which necessitated completely revamping much of the story with just under a year left to go before its release. In at least some versions of the story, Elsa was going to be the villain, and the story was going to be a more complicated one about the two sistersâ€™ relationship. (It is, after all, inspired by the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale â€œThe Snow Queen,â€ where said Snow Queen is more villainous than not.) But Elsaâ€™s also the gal who sings â€œLet It Go.â€ She canâ€™t be the filmâ€™s ultimate villain, even if sheâ€™s redeemed in the end.
So the Hans twist transformed Elsaâ€™s arc into something else entirely. But it also meant her sexuality was left undefined, a princess â€” and ultimately a queen â€” without a prince.
You are probably familiar with the conversational tendencies of the internet, and you probably know several LGBTQ people as well. â€œNot yet confirmed as straightâ€? Weâ€™ll fucking take it. Weâ€™ll take it and run with it, baby.
Queer readings of Frozen and Elsaâ€™s role within the film started appearing on social media shortly after the movie was released in November 2013, but they really began taking off in early 2014. In particular, San Diego State University professor Angel Daniel Matos, who studies the intersection of queer narratives and childrenâ€™s literature, wrote a January 2014 article in which he argued that considering Elsa via the lens of queer literary theory made lots of sense.
Matos wrote:
Queen Elsa is approached by some viewers as a queer or gay character, not only because she doesnâ€™t engage in a romantic relationship in the film, but also because she is forced by her parents to suppress and hide the powers that she is born with. Although the movie implies that her parents desperately try to conceal Elsaâ€™s powers because of the danger that they impose to herself and to others, this does not justify the degree to which they prevent Elsa from having any human contact whatsoever. Furthermore, the fact that Elsaâ€™s parents view suppression and isolation as solutions further emphasizes notions of the infamous queer closet.
Iâ€™d even go one step further than that. It was an unfortunate trope for far too long that if a film or TV show featured an LGBTQ character, that character would often be the storyâ€™s villain. See, for instance, The Silence of the Lambsâ€™ serial murderer Buffalo Bill, a character the movie goes out of its way to insist isnâ€™t actually trans, despite also depicting him as pretty darn trans; he is, after all, killing multiple women to sew himself a suit made from their skin to transform himself into a lady. (Bill! Take some estradiol already geez!) As a result, scores of â€œvillainâ€ tropes have also become attached to LGBTQ characters and vice versa. Scar from the original Lion King is a good example; the movie never comes out and says heâ€™s gay, but câ€™mon.
So Elsa, because she was at one time meant to be Frozenâ€™s villain, exhibits lots of traits that we associate with LGBTQ characters, rightly or wrongly. She isolates herself from society. She has strange, barely understood powers. She lashes out at those who would drag her back to the mainstream. Sheâ€™s kind of like one of the X-Men, and the X-Men have always welcomed queer readings as well.
Critically, Elsa isnâ€™t the movieâ€™s villain. Her love for Anna, and Annaâ€™s love for her, is what saves the day by the end of the film, and she learns to revel in her powers once she discovers that she can control them through love (awwwww). Elsa fears what makes her different, and sheâ€™s encouraged to do so by her parents. But she ultimately embraces that difference and is happier for having done so. A queer reading of the character all but suggests itself. Lots of fans thought so, too, and in 2016, a #GiveElsaaGirlfriend hashtag briefly became a Twitter sensation.
But if you didnâ€™t notice any queer subtext in Frozen, then Frozen 2 wants to hit you over the head with it â€” so long as you go in asking to be hit over the head.
In Frozen 2, Elsa gets a girlfriend, except she doesnâ€™t at all
Honeymaren is on the left, and I, for one, think she and Elsa will be very happy together. Disney
Early in Frozen 2, Elsa begins to hear a strange, female voice calling her into the great unknown. She might as well be a gay teenager in 1972 seeing a news report about â€œunusual communitiesâ€ of â€œlike-minded menâ€ gathering in the Castro. She races after the voice, dragging the rest of the filmâ€™s dramatis personae with her.
Almost immediately upon entering the enchanted forest that blocks Elsa from locating the source of the voice, sheâ€™s set upon by local warriors, including a fetching young woman named Honeymaren. Once everyone is convinced Elsa and her entourage mean well, theyâ€™re welcomed into the forest village, where Elsa and Honeymaren have a heartfelt chat around the campfire. The setup for this pairing is shockingly similar to that of Anna and her eventual boyfriend Kristoff from the first film.

On Frozen 2 and Disneyâ€™s nostalgia problem
Here we go, I thought. Theyâ€™re going to embark on an adventure together, and Honeymaren will be Elsaâ€™s girlfriend, even if the movie never comes out and says it. Instead, Elsa heads off with her established group of friends, finally ditching even Anna, and Honeymaren basically exits the film except for a very quick shot where she waves to Elsa at the end. (Elsa does obtain a horse she finds in the ocean, which is not nothing.)
Even by the standards of â€œgiving Elsa a girlfriend where everybody knows theyâ€™re together, but nobody says it, you know, like your aunt and her â€˜special friend,â€™â€ this was weak tea (though Elsa does eventually abandon the throne of Arendelle to live in the Enchanted Forest, so itâ€™s VanDerWerff Canon that she and Honeymaren hook up after that point). While itâ€™s true that the center of Frozen as a franchise has always been the relationship between Elsa and Anna, Frozen 2 gives Anna and Kristoff a rather elaborate plot about getting engaged; meanwhile, when it comes to love interests, Elsa gets nothing.
The movie offers zero evidence as to her romantic inclinations, which in and of itself is interesting.
To be clear, it continues to be subversive that Elsa is a character defined entirely by her lack of a love interest. I donâ€™t want to discount Frozen 2â€™s emphasis on Elsaâ€™s powerful independence, which will undoubtedly hold a lot of sway with parents who want their daughters to know you can be queen without needing a king, assuming you can command the ice itself. But listen to me and about 500 of my friends here: Give Elsa a girlfriend!!!
The upshot of Frozen 2 is that Elsa remains canonically non-straight but also canonically non-queer. And yet where the queer subtext for the character in the first Frozen seemed mostly to arise by accident, it feels more intentional in this movie. The Honeymaren scenes have the feel of meet-cute moments, and Elsaâ€™s ultimate story involves a significant sequence where she seeks support from the spirits of her deceased parents for choices sheâ€™s made. Whatâ€™s more, many of the scenes with Elsa in Arendelle early in the film underline how she doesnâ€™t seem quite at home there, in Annaâ€™s heteronormative paradise. Sheâ€™s gotta follow the voice! Of a beautiful lady! To another place! Where she feels more at home! No reason!
Frozen 2 doesnâ€™t tell us that Elsaâ€™s gay, but it all but begs writers like me to say things like, â€œElsa from Frozen is queer, and I can prove it.â€ And that should be enough. The value of art and culture is inherently linked to what we bring to it as viewers, and Frozen 2 gives viewers more than enough to conclude that Elsa is, indeed, Disneyâ€™s first queer princess and Honeymaren her queen! Thatâ€™s sufficient! Right?
Nah.
Disneyâ€™s movies often make gestures toward progressive representation while avoiding doing anything truly new or radical
Elsa, on her life as Queen of Arendelle: There must be more than this provincial life!!! Disney
Letâ€™s briefly veer away from whatever queer subtext exists within Frozen 2 to discuss the filmâ€™s treatment of native peoples displaced by colonizers, in a story told via the inhabitants of the enchanted forest â€” who were very nearly destroyed by the forces of Arendelle before magic sealed off the forest through means the movie barely explains.
Disneyâ€™s films this decade have been positively rampant with the idea of confronting the darker, seedier side of history to better understand where we come from. In the last couple of years alone, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, and the Maleficent sequel have all circled this basic theme. These movies even rely on similar structures to reveal their shameful secrets: The characters have heard the generally understood history, then they learn a couple of pieces of information that complicate that history, and then they get the full, unvarnished truth late in act two. The end of each film becomes an attempt to synthesize the ideals that the characters stand for and their increased understanding of the less reputable aspects of their own history.
This entire arc plays out in Frozen 2, too, but when it comes time for the film to deal with its most consequential idea â€” that to put right what once went wrong, Anna and Elsa will have to destroy Arendelle â€” it blinks and lets everybody live. Itâ€™s like a paraphrase of that old Simpsons quote about alcohol: Arendelle â€” the cause of and solution to everybodyâ€™s problems.
Disney keeps coming back to the idea of metaphorically dissecting the unsavory aspects American history in order to move forward as a nation. But it almost never has the guts to actually suggest anything needs to change to upend the current social order, because the current social order places Disney at the top of the year-end box office nearly every year. A world where we really got serious about righting the wrongs of colonialism would be a world that might also start to undercut capitalism. And if youâ€™re Disney, you canâ€™t have that.
So the companyâ€™s films indulge in half-measures designed to let viewers who are progressively inclined feel as if theyâ€™re picking up on something truly new and interesting, while never actually challenging any of the baseline presumptions of a society that allows Disney to remain dominant. Even the best movie Iâ€™ve listed here â€” Black Panther â€” sweeps all of its messy thematic ideas mostly under the bed by the time it kicks off its final fight.
The same goes for Disneyâ€™s queer characters, to the extent that queer characters exist in its films. Theyâ€™re either completely peripheral (like that guy in Endgame) or theyâ€™re queer in the sense that a box from Ikea is a couch. You can get from here to there, but you have to put in the work. Elsa is queer because enough of us say she is; we also live with the knowledge that Frozen 3 might well marry her off to the new Duke of Weselton or something.
And this trend extends across Disney as a whole. Weâ€™re a long way from, like, a trans Marvel superhero. Indeed, when Marvelâ€™s Kevin Feige confirmed this summer that Thorâ€™s Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) is attracted to women, he didnâ€™t do so by writing that detail into a movie. He simply said it was true while onstage at Comic-Con. How daring!
Whatâ€™s goofy about this sturm und drang is that I donâ€™t even like the Frozen movies all that much, but I feel so starved for a Disney story that might signal to kids that LGBTQ people are thoroughly fine that Iâ€™ll grasp at whatever straws I can get. Elsaâ€™s not canonically queer, but sheâ€™s queer enough that itâ€™s not too difficult to imagine some little girl seeing Elsa as a kindred spirit, then following that feeling as far as it will take her.
I know precisely why Disney doesnâ€™t want to make Elsa queer. Just the sight of two moms in the background of a scene in Toy Story 4 sent right-wing watchdog groups into a frenzy with complaints designed to throw red, raw chum out to Facebook. Itâ€™s also very hard to get depictions of homosexuality, no matter how chaste, past government censors in China, one of the most important film markets in the world. If Elsa were canonically queer, even if canon amounted to â€œshe once kissed a girl on the cheek,â€ even if canon amounted to â€œshe had a flirty adventure with another girl,â€ Disney would be risking the loss of millions upon millions of dollars at the box office.
But also, you know what? I donâ€™t care. If Disney really believes in the kind of progressive representation it pretends to stand for, then its choices to barely depict LGBTQ people in its films â€” while simultaneously winking to let us know that, yeah, Elsaâ€™s totes gay â€” are more than just irritating. Theyâ€™re an abdication of the moral code the company vaguely genuflects toward having, in the name of higher profits.
Iâ€™m not as incensed as I sound. There are dozens upon dozens of issues that affect the LGBTQ community far more than our representation in Disney films. I hope if Elsa gets a boyfriend in Frozen 3, heâ€™s voiced by Broadway legend Michael Cerveris, and I hope the character is a werewolf. I donâ€™t need Elsa to be gay to validate my humanity, because Iâ€™m really good at doing that myself.
But I do wish one of the biggest media corporations in the world would stop playing footsie with us and hoping weâ€™ll all crow about how awesome and woke it is. Disney doesnâ€™t have to make Elsa gay, but somebody should be."
"WARREN TOWNSHIP, New Jersey â€” When Ed Fahy agreed to go to addiction treatment in February 2016, he expected to get into recovery near his home and family in Warren Township, New Jersey.
Nearly seven months later, and a thousand miles away in Palm Beach County, Florida, he would overdose and die at the age of 28. After his health insurance plan repeatedly denied requests to cover inpatient treatment closer to home, he wound up in Florida â€” at a sober living house that was so bad it was eventually shut down by law enforcement.
Fahyâ€™s mother, Maureen Oâ€™Reilly, is clear about whom she blames: the health insurance companies.
Oâ€™Reilly at her kitchen table.

Fahy initially tried to get inpatient treatment for his addiction to opioids, cocaine, and alcohol at two different facilities in New Jersey. But his health plan administrator, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and its behavioral health benefits manager, Beacon Health Options, repeatedly denied his claims. Fahyâ€™s family, after a desperate search, found treatment that was covered in Florida.
Down south, Fahy got caught in whatâ€™s now known as the â€œFlorida shuffleâ€ â€” a quagmire of low-quality, weakly regulated addiction treatment centers and sober homes. It was at one of these sober homes where Fahy overdosed on fentanyl and cocaine.
Oâ€™Reilly said none of it would have happened if Horizon and Beacon approved inpatient treatment in New Jersey, instead of pushing Fahy to Florida. â€œYou canâ€™t be yanked out of this place and that place, and be sent to the worst place in the United States to recover,â€ she told me, sitting in her kitchen.
Oâ€™Reilly is now suing Horizon and Beacon for allegedly denying medically necessary treatment. In the lawsuit, first filed in 2018, Oâ€™Reilly alleges that Horizon and Beacon violated their contract, fiduciary duty, and state law, causing Fahyâ€™s â€œwrongful death.â€
Fahy was far from alone in dealing with problems with insurance. In interviews with experts and addiction patients, insurance is commonly cited as one of the biggest barriers to obtaining treatment in the US. As part of Voxâ€™s Rehab Racket project, nearly 900 people have filled out a survey sharing their experiences with addiction care â€” many of them blaming poor insurance coverage for lack of access and spiraling costs.
The Rehab Racket is Voxâ€™s investigation into Americaâ€™s notoriously opaque addiction treatment industry. Weâ€™re crowdsourcing patients and familiesâ€™ rehab stories, with an emphasis on the cost of treatment and quality of care. If youâ€™d like help our reporting by sharing your story, please fill out this survey.
About 100,000 people in the US in 2018 needed drug addiction treatment but couldnâ€™t get it because their insurance either didnâ€™t cover treatment at all or didnâ€™t cover the full costs, according to an estimate from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Amid an opioid epidemic that has contributed to the more than 700,000 drug overdose deaths in the US since 1999, experts argue poor insurance coverage is leading to more untreated addiction and death.
Insurersâ€™ reluctance to pay for addiction treatment is inextricably linked to the two big problems with American addiction care: high costs and low quality.
The USâ€™s addiction treatment system largely rose up outside of mainstream health care. Addiction was seen as a moral failure, not a medical condition, and care initially came largely from community groups, many of them basing their practices off the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Since addiction services werenâ€™t viewed as part of mainstream health care, health insurers by and large refused to cover treatment.
The effects linger to this day. Health insurers still resist covering treatment despite federal and state laws trying to get them to do so. Insurersâ€™ refusal to pay also means they are not consistently providing any form of quality control â€” something they do in other areas of health care by, for example, ensuring money theyâ€™re spending will go to evidence-based practices that actually improve outcomes.
So families might be forced to pay tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars out of pocket for care, as Iâ€™ve reported time and time again for Voxâ€™s Rehab Racket project. Or people seeking help are forced to shuffle from treatment to treatment in a desperate attempt to land on something that insurance will finally pay for. Or they might not get treatment at all.
Meanwhile, insurance companies can get out of paying for treatment that can be expensive and entail costs for months or even years.
Insurersâ€™ behavior is a â€œpurely profit-driven notion,â€ Ellen Weber, vice president for health initiatives at the Legal Action Center, told me. â€œThereâ€™s some sense [people with addiction] will never get better, some sense that they donâ€™t deserve health care services.â€
Horizon said in a statement that â€œthe claims being made in [Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s] lawsuit are untrue, unfounded, and unfair.â€ Beacon declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.
After Fahyâ€™s death, Oâ€™Reilly has caught herself thinking about what should have been. â€œItâ€™s just these thoughts that you have,â€ she explained.
Thoughts like that the check she wrote for Fahyâ€™s funeral should have been for a down payment on his first house. And that the people who gathered there in suits and dresses should have been dressing up for his wedding instead.

He wanted treatment in New Jersey, but his insurance plan wouldnâ€™t pay
Fahy first used heroin when he was 19, according to his mother, as a sophomore at Catholic University of America. After his roommate told her about Fahyâ€™s heroin use, Oâ€™Reilly got him to a psychiatrist who prescribed buprenorphine, one of the medications that studies show reduces the mortality rate among opioid addiction patients by half or more. Fahy improved, but would struggle on and off with his opioid, cocaine, and alcohol addictions for years.
By 2015, Fahy had landed a job as a chemist at NatureX, a botanicals company, near New York City. But he started using drugs again, which hurt his performance at work, and he was eventually fired. Then he broke up with his girlfriend, and moved back home in New Jersey. His drug use accelerated.
â€œHe was emaciated,â€ Oâ€™Reilly said. â€œBefore that, he wasnâ€™t heavy, but he wasnâ€™t thin. â€¦ I was shocked.â€
On February 6, 2016, the family got in an argument in front of Fahy about whether he should get into treatment â€” and he finally agreed to go. He went to Sunrise Detox, a facility in Stirling, New Jersey, he had previously attended and liked, for inpatient care, signing in around 1 am on February 7.
Oâ€™Reilly was â€œeuphoricâ€ after she dropped Fahy off, she said. â€œI was so elated on the drive home.â€
At this point, Fahy was under his momâ€™s insurance plan through her employment as a public defender. She was paying $700 to $750 a month to keep Fahy on the plan, but believed it would be worth it. â€œI thought private insurance was the ultimate,â€ she said.

The plan was self-funded, meaning that Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s employer, the state of New Jersey, paid for Fahyâ€™s care. But the state hired the insurance company Horizon to administrate what treatment was approved and what wasnâ€™t. For addiction care, these decisions were largely made by Beacon, Horizonâ€™s behavioral health benefits manager. Although self-funded plans generally face fewer regulations than other kinds of health insurance, the plan was still supposed to cover addiction care.
But two days after dropping her son off, Oâ€™Reilly learned that Horizon and Beacon wouldnâ€™t approve coverage for inpatient treatment at Sunrise Detox. For detox and inpatient care, that could cost Oâ€™Reilly more than $20,000 a month out of pocket at todayâ€™s rates, based on a call to Sunrise Detoxâ€™s admissions line.
Following advice from Fahyâ€™s providers at Sunrise Detox, Oâ€™Reilly moved her son to another inpatient facility, in Lafayette Township, New Jersey, on the same day: Sunrise House, which has no direct relation to Sunrise Detox. For 11 days, Fahy did well there; medical notes, which Oâ€™Reilly obtained after his death, showed he accepted treatment, and Oâ€™Reilly found Fahy in better spirits when she attended a family event at Sunrise House.
But by February 20, 2016, it was clear that Horizon and Beacon werenâ€™t going to approve further treatment at Sunrise House. Fahyâ€™s family had to pay out of pocket for the rest of the stay â€” a full month of inpatient care could cost $15,000 today, based on a call to Sunrise Houseâ€™s admissions line â€” or he had to leave.
Searching for a facility that would take Fahy and where coverage would be approved, the family landed on the Transformations Treatment Center in Delray Beach, Florida.
Fahy took the news badly. According to medical records, he didnâ€™t want to leave his family â€” his primary support network â€” and complained that he didnâ€™t want to go to a â€œred state.â€ But it was the quickest option that Horizon and Beacon would likely approve coverage for, so Fahy went.
In Florida, though, insurance problems would pop up again. Horizon and Beacon wouldnâ€™t agree to cover the full level of inpatient care that Fahy and his providers asked for. Within months, Fahy relapsed twice. When he tried to get into Transformations after the second relapse in July 2016, even intensive outpatient was eventually denied. Later discharged from Transformations despite what his therapist there described in one medical note as a â€œhigh risk of relapse,â€ Fahy was pushed to seek treatment at another outpatient facility â€” one later shut down by law enforcement.
Horizon and Beaconâ€™s letters denying coverage, provided by Oâ€™Reilly, illustrate an opaque process with life-or-death stakes. Horizon and Beacon would deny coverage of treatment Fahy sought, recommending a lower level of care. Heâ€™d seek that lower level of treatment instead, and it too would be denied either altogether or after a few days. When coverage was approved, it was often after multiple attempts. Horizon and Beacon would sometimes approve coverage at the same level that was previously rejected with little to no explanation about what, if anything, had changed.
This seems to be a common tactic for insurance companies: deny as much coverage as possible, hoping that patients will give up. Insurers â€œbank on families and consumers not having the capacity to appeal these decisions,â€ Weber, of the Legal Action Center, said.
The result: Fahy couldnâ€™t get coverage for the full level of inpatient treatment that he, his providers, and reviews of Horizon and Beaconâ€™s coverage decisions suggested he needed. As one of Fahyâ€™s doctors wrote in an August 2016 medical note, â€œPatient is unable to obtain or maintain sobriety as an outpatient and requires inpatient clinical therapy directed to prevent relapse.â€
In the last few weeks of his life, Fahy settled for the Living Right sober home and Palm Beach Recovery and Wellness for intensive outpatient â€” both of which were run by the same owners in Palm Beach County, Florida.
He died at the sober home on September 3, 2016, after using cocaine and fentanyl in one of the houseâ€™s bathrooms. No one checked on him for eight hours before he was found dead, Oâ€™Reilly said. Both the home and treatment facility were later shut down after their proprietors, who couldnâ€™t be reached for comment, were arrested for patient brokering in 2017.
Until the moment she went to the funeral home to look at Fahyâ€™s body, Oâ€™Reilly said she kept hoping it was someone else â€” that someone, maybe, had stolen Fahyâ€™s identity. â€œBut, of course, it was Ed,â€ Oâ€™Reilly said. â€œI touched his hair and his face. But he was so stone-cold dead.â€
According to Oâ€™Reilly, Fahy loved his familyâ€™s sprawling backyard. â€œWe even have a creek that runs in the back. Now itâ€™s more a swamp, because it needs some work done,â€ she said.
Insurers often donâ€™t know what good or necessary treatment is
Addiction is such a difficult condition to treat, and addiction treatment quality is so inconsistent in the US, that itâ€™s impossible to say for certain how things would have turned out if Fahyâ€™s inpatient treatment in New Jersey was approved.
But experts argue insurers could play a major role in alleviating these problems â€” by covering care and holding addiction treatments to a higher standard. One problem is that insurers often donâ€™t know what good or necessary treatment is, because theyâ€™ve remained outside the field for so long, and so much of what is out there is of uncertain quality.
â€œWithout being able to sort out who does a good job and who doesnâ€™t, itâ€™s very hard to assign responsibility here,â€ Richard Frank, a health economist at Harvard who studies addiction treatment, told me. But if insurers deny addiction treatment based on quality, he added, â€œthey should also be offering up some place that does the job better.â€
In Fahyâ€™s case, that didnâ€™t happen â€” given that he was over time pushed to a facility that was eventually shut down due to patient brokering. And the first two facilities that Fahy tried to get coverage for, Sunrise Detox and Sunrise House, were actually in-network, yet Horizon and Beacon still rejected coverage for them.
Oâ€™Reilly also pointed to several problems with Fahyâ€™s addiction treatment in general.
Fahy did well earlier in his life on the opioid addiction medication buprenorphine, and studies show that medications are generally the most effective treatment for opioid addiction. But buprenorphine was never offered to him throughout 2016 for long-term care.
Fahy also struggled with depression, which Oâ€™Reilly said he never got proper care for. In July 2016, according to medical notes from Transformations at the time, he complained he was â€œfeeling worthless, hopeless, and frequent isolation.â€
â€œYou canâ€™t be yanked out of this place and that place, and be sent to the worst place in the United States to recoverâ€
As an atheist, Fahy also distrusted the 12 steps due to their demands that he submit to a â€œhigher power.â€ Yet the 12-steps approach was the addiction treatment modality he was repeatedly offered, including in New Jersey. (Itâ€™s used in about 70 percent of treatment facilities in the US, with alternatives often difficult to find.)
The treatment centers arenâ€™t faultless, with their own problems providing evidence-based care. American Addiction Centers, which owns Sunrise House, said it offers treatments for addiction and mental health conditions, trying to match patientsâ€™ needs. AAC also claimed to provide medications for opioid addiction if â€œdeemed appropriate by the medical provider evaluating the patient.â€ But when I called Sunrise Houseâ€™s admissions line, the receptionist said they would prefer patients not stay on such medications â€” perpetuating the stigmatizing myth that getting on medications is replacing one drug with another.
Sunrise Detox didnâ€™t respond to multiple requests for comment. Transformations declined to comment, citing Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s lawsuit.
Part of reforming addiction care in America will require insurers to reject low-quality addiction treatment, pushing patients to higher-quality services. If insurers â€œbelieve thereâ€™s a high likelihood that this person is going to get a treatment that is going to run up the bill and not get them better, then [the insurer] is right not to go along with it,â€ Frank said.
But based on reviews of coverage decisions conducted by one of Beaconâ€™s own doctors and, later, an outside agency, Horizon and Beacon appeared to deny treatment that was medically necessary â€” another possible sign they didnâ€™t really know what care addiction patients require.
Initially, Beacon denied inpatient and detox treatment at Sunrise Detox from February 7, 2016, and beyond and at Sunrise House from February 9, 2016, and beyond. But in two notes on February 25, 2016, a Beacon staffer identified as Dr. Kho wrote that inpatient and detox treatment should have been covered in both facilities in New Jersey. Kho explained that Fahy had high withdrawal scores and was â€œat high risk for worsening withdrawals,â€ among other clinical factors that warranted the level of treatment that he was previously denied.
By the time of the internal review, Fahy had already gone to Florida. Oâ€™Reilly said she did not see the review or know of it until after Fahy died, when she requested his medical records.

Fahyâ€™s guitar was brought back from South Florida, where he died. It sits in Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s kitchen, where one of her other sons still picks it up and plays.
Separately, a later report by independent clinical review company MCMC, which Oâ€™Reilly requested, overturned Horizon and Beaconâ€™s decision to deny coverage for intensive outpatient treatment at Transformations on July 26, 2016, and beyond. It listed several reasons Fahy required continued care, including â€œlow motivation for sobriety.â€ It added, â€œIf we have overturned the denial, your plan or health insurance issuer will now provide service or payment.â€
That review was dated on November 17, 2017, more than a year and two months after Fahyâ€™s death.
Horizon defended its decisions in a statement, claiming â€œcoverage was provided for well more than 100 days of [substance use disorder] treatment.â€ A spokesperson for Horizon wrote, â€œBeacon authorized [substance use disorder] treatment, from both in-network and out-of-network providers, consistent with the terms of Mr. Fahyâ€™s health-benefit plan and [American Society of Addiction Medicine] criteria based on the clinical information provided by the treatment facility at the time.â€
Asked about the internal and external reviews of coverage decisions, the spokesperson added, â€œWe do not know what additional information, if any, Dr. Kho may have had in performing his retrospective review. It does not appear that MCMCâ€™s review engaged Beacon or Horizon directly in any way nor was it conducted as part of any administrative appeal, so we cannot speak to their process or determinations. Regardless, Mr. Fahy was, at the time of his death, approved for an [intensive outpatient program] through September 6, 2016.â€
Still, Horizon and Beacon both seem to be aware of a bigger problem. They, along with several other insurers, have teamed up with the advocacy organization Shatterproof to develop better standards for addiction care.
That, experts say, is what insurers should be doing. â€œIf [insurers] are going to pay for treatments, theyâ€™re going to have to look like modern health care,â€ Frank said. â€œThat raises the bar. That may not raise the bar to the level that weâ€™d like â€¦ but I think it pushes us in the right direction.â€
Existing laws could improve addiction treatment coverage, but theyâ€™re poorly enforced
Americaâ€™s addiction treatment system is supposed to be a main line of defense against overdose crises like the opioid epidemic. But Fahyâ€™s story conveys where this treatment system and the insurance apparatus thatâ€™s supposed to pay for it can fall short, even as federal and state lawmakers say that they now see addiction as a public health problem and rush to boost funding for treatment.
Two federal laws â€” the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, passed in 2008, and the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 â€” are supposed to require parity between physical and mental health care: If an insurer covers physical health services at a certain level, and says that it covers mental health and addiction care too, it should cover mental health and addiction services at the same level as physical health care. Several states, including New Jersey, have passed their own versions of these laws.
Beacon has run into trouble with these laws before. In 2015, the New York attorney general concluded that the company, previously known as ValueOptions, wrongly denied addiction and mental health coverage in the state. A settlement required Beacon, which claims 40 million customers nationwide, to â€œdramatically reform its claims review process and pay a $900,000 penalty,â€ according to a statement by the attorney generalâ€™s office at the time.
Generally, though, the laws are poorly enforced. A study by consulting company Milliman found insurers in 2015 on average paid over 21 percent more for primary care services than behavioral services, including addiction. Behavioral care was as much as 5.8 times more likely than physical or surgical care to be provided out of network â€” making it more expensive and harder to access.
About 100,000 people in the US in 2018 needed drug addiction treatment but couldnâ€™t get it because their insurance either didnâ€™t cover treatment at all or didnâ€™t cover the full costs
The White Houseâ€™s opioid commission dedicated a section in its 2017 report to better enforcement of parity laws, asking that the US Department of Labor get â€œreal authority to regulate the health insurance industryâ€ and that insurers that violate parity laws â€œbe held responsible.â€
Insurers do seem to be paying more for addiction care than they used to. According to the Health Care Cost Institute, commercial insurers spent a little more than $17,000 on the average patient with a substance use disorder in 2017, up from nearly $13,500 in 2008. Thatâ€™s likely due in part to the opioid crisis, but also likely due to the parity laws passed and implemented since 2008, indicating that such measures can make an impact.
The concern is that insurers still arenâ€™t paying enough, given the scale of the opioid crisis, and arenâ€™t paying for the right things. Since insurers have long resisted paying for addiction care, and as a result avoided evaluating the quality of such treatment, theyâ€™re cautious that anything they pay for in this area may be an ineffective waste of money. But they can only fix this problem by getting serious about addiction treatment coverage, whether by force of law or by will.
Part of the problem is the laws mandating insurance involvement are genuinely difficult to enforce. They require deciding whatâ€™s medically necessary, a concept that is abstract and largely up to interpretation.
Itâ€™s also more difficult for regulators to challenge these calls than for insurance companies to make them. Regulators have to request, obtain, and verify medical records and internal reviews, which takes time and resources.
â€œThe problem there is that itâ€™s not like thereâ€™s an algorithm for [enforcement]â€, Sherry Glied, a health economist and dean of New York Universityâ€™s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, told me. â€œYou sort of have to go in after the fact and see what is going on. No one has really come up with a good way.â€
Some states are trying. New York, for one, has pushed to â€œgo above parity,â€ Rob Kent, general counsel for the stateâ€™s Office of Addiction Services and Supports, told me. New York has escalated its enforcement, requiring insurers to use a standardized tool to decide what level of care addiction patients need and proactively submit information to regulators about how theyâ€™re complying with the law. But Kent acknowledged New York still has work to do in building up its staff to better monitor insurance companies.
In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) earlier this year signed an enhanced parity law, which includes a new requirement for insurers to send an annual compliance report to the stateâ€™s Department of Banking and Insurance.
The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance cited the law in response to a request for comment about Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s case, adding that it â€œtakes complaints seriously.â€
Still, Weber, of the Legal Action Center, said, â€œI donâ€™t think there is any state insurance department right now that does [enforcement] well.â€
Meanwhile, some families are, like Oâ€™Reilly, taking matters into their own hands. In the course of this story, I spoke to several family members of addiction patients who sued insurers â€” some of whom couldnâ€™t talk on the record, because their settlement deals barred them from doing so.
In March 2019, some of these families won in a big, public case: In Wit v. United Behavioral Health, a federal court found United had illegally denied mental health and addiction treatment coverage to tens of thousands of patients. The ruling will likely be appealed, but if it succeeds, it could set a precedent for the industry.
Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s case is still in the early stages. So far, both sides have filed dueling motions about whether the lawsuit should be dismissed. As it progresses, thereâ€™s a chance that the threat of trial will lead to a settlement, as has happened in many similar cases in the past.
â€œAfter Ed died, we havenâ€™t gotten around to fixing things around the house anymore,â€ said Oâ€™Reilly.
The lawsuit, she said, is about holding people accountable for Fahyâ€™s death â€” and sending a broader message about the state of insurance and addiction treatment. â€œThe health insurance industry needs to be reined in,â€ she said.
As a public defender, Oâ€™Reilly has seen many clients mandated to treatment through drug court, paid for by the state. She sometimes wonders if that would have been a better fate for her son. â€œBut then sometimes Iâ€™m sitting in court, and theyâ€™re handcuffed, and theyâ€™re in the prison garb, and I think, â€˜Oh, I wouldnâ€™t want that for Ed,â€™â€ Oâ€™Reilly explained.
She continued, â€œAt the same time, Iâ€™d rather see him in jail or even prison alive than dead.â€

"President Donald Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid from the Ukrainian government, seemingly to push lawmakers to announce an investigation into the son of a potential political opponent and his work with a Ukrainian energy company. That much, at least, is clear. As is the fact that Trump has an 89 percent approval rating with Republican voters.
Thatâ€™s why most Republican lawmakers arenâ€™t going to change their minds on the impeachment of President Trump. While some in Congress might privately think that Trumpâ€™s efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to â€œdo him a favorâ€ and investigate former Vice President Joe Biden were a bad idea, they wonâ€™t say so in public.
Because, quite simply, Trump is the president. Heâ€™s giving them what they want politically, the economy appears strong and, most critically, he is far more popular and powerful than they are.
Your guide to the Donald Trump impeachment saga
Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.
But House Republicans and many Trump-supportive conservative and right-leaning writers and pundits have largely attempted to avoid saying as much.
Rather, together with constantly shifting responses to specific testimony, they appear to have developed three basic defenses for Trump as House impeachment hearings continued: He was â€œtoo ineptâ€ to have intended to do what he is being accused of doing; what he did was actually good; or his actions were bad, but not impeachable.
But some congressional Republicans and conservatives have begun voicing another, perhaps more telling, defense of Trump: Whatever he did, it doesnâ€™t matter â€” not to â€œnormal peopleâ€ and not to the Republican Party.
1) â€œImpeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the governmentâ€
The first basic defense of Trump regarding Ukraine is the simplest: Trump lacked the intent and the basic competence to get a quid pro quo deal with Ukraine done. And without intent (legally defined as a conscious decision to commit an illegal act), some argue that what Trump did may have been bad and dumb, but not criminal â€” and thus, not a â€œhigh crime or misdemeanor.â€
As elucidated by the Wall Street Journal editorial board in October:
... it may turn out that while Mr. Trump wanted a quid-pro-quo policy ultimatum toward Ukraine, he was too inept to execute it. Impeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the government, and most Presidents at some point or another in office.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham seemingly agreed, telling CBS News earlier this month that the administration appeared â€œincapableâ€ of forming a quid pro quo, thus rendering the entire impeachment discussion null and void.
Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro made similar arguments on his podcast, saying on October 7 that Trump would make a fantastic client for a defense attorney because â€œTrump doesnâ€™t have requisite intent for anything. The man has the attention span of a gnat ... if you are his defense lawyer, his best defense to â€˜he had a plan in Ukraine to go after Joe Bidenâ€™ is â€˜dude doesnâ€™t have plans.â€™â€ And on November 11, Shapiro argued, â€œI donâ€™t think heâ€™s had the level of intent necessary to eat a hamburger.â€ I reached out to Shapiro, but he was unable to comment on Wednesday.
And after all, military aid to Ukraine was eventually restored. So according to this argument, the actions for which Trump is facing impeachment (withholding aid for selfish reasons) never actually happened. Per National Reviewâ€™s Rich Lowry, â€œThe best defense Republicans can muster is that nothing came of it. An ally was discomfited and yanked around for a couple of months before, ultimately, getting its defense funding.â€
And his magazineâ€™s editorial board argued earlier this month, â€œIt has to matter that, at the end of the day, the harm of this episode was minimal or nonexistent. The Ukrainians got their defense aid without making any statement committing themselves to the investigations.â€
Itâ€™s true that intent matters â€” in criminal proceedings. I spoke with Ken White, a criminal defense attorney and former US attorney, who told me, â€œIntent is very important in court, and for many of these crimes, from witness intimidation to bribery, prosecutors must prove corrupt intent. If we were in federal court, litigating criminal charges against the president, I think the â€œTrump is just Trumpâ€ defense would be colorable and tricky to overcome.
â€œWith normal humans, when they act like Trump you can infer corrupt intent; the defense is that you canâ€™t make that inference with Trump because he acts that way all the time, reflexively.â€
But White added two caveats. â€œFirst, thatâ€™s a matter of proof. A jury could still reject it and see corrupt intent. Second, this ainâ€™t federal court.â€ Impeachment, after all, is a political process, not a legal one.
And as to the argument that funding to Ukraine was indeed restored, the Cato Instituteâ€™s Gene Healy pointed out in October that an unsuccessful or â€œincompetentâ€ attempt to commit an impeachable act doesnâ€™t make it less impeachable:
The Nixon crew botched most of the schemes it undertook, from the Watergate caper to the attempt to audit the presidentâ€™s political enemies. That didnâ€™t save Richard Nixon from being driven from office via the impeachment process.
2) â€œDonald Trump and Rudy Giuliani deserve praiseâ€
Some of Trumpâ€™s defenders are taking an entirely different approach and stating that Trumpâ€™s actions were not only defensible, but good. In the words of Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) (who criticized Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman for having â€œopinions counterâ€ to the president), â€œitâ€™s perfectly within the purview of the presidentâ€™s authorityâ€ to base military aid on the assurance of an investigation into corruption (or more accurately, the announcement of an investigation).
They argue that the government of Ukraine was corrupt and Trump was elected to fight corruption â€” ergo, of course he would resist sending aid to Ukraine. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) put it this way: â€œCorruption is not just prevalent in Ukraine. Itâ€™s the system. Our president said time out, time out, letâ€™s check out this new guy.â€
As Washington Examiner writer Byron York wrote in a piece titled â€œWhat if Trump was right about Ukraine?â€, supporters of this line of logic argue that while perhaps Trumpâ€™s actions werenâ€™t the best, he had real and genuine concerns about Ukraineâ€™s government and its alleged efforts to collude with the Clinton campaign and influence the 2016 election.
Those efforts are based on allegations that Ukrainian officials, concerned about former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafortâ€™s work for a pro-Russian political party, attempted to assist the Clinton campaign and harm the Trump campaign. Right-leaning media outlets have focused serious attention on those allegations since 2017.
For example, the Federalistâ€™s Mollie Hemingway argued on Fox News in October of this year, â€œYou have people who have already admitted that people affiliated with the Ukrainian government worked with the Democratic National Committeeâ€™s contractors to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign,â€ arguing that Ukraine and the DNC took part in actual collusion, unlike Russia and Trumpâ€™s campaign.
York writes that if the allegations were true, Trumpâ€™s actions make sense. â€œIf [those concerns] were even mostly legitimate, then Trump defenders could say: â€œLook, he had a point. Even if one thinks he handled the issue inappropriately, the fact is, what was going on in Ukraine was worrisome enough for a United States president to take notice.â€ Quoting former US Special Representative to Ukraine Kurt Volker, York concluded, â€œThe president said Ukraine â€˜tried to take me down.â€™ He wasnâ€™t wrong.â€ (Itâ€™s worth noting that other conservatives disagree.)
This was the argument that Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a writer at National Review who published â€œThe Case for Trumpâ€ earlier this year, made to me, saying that it made sense for Trump to be suspicious of Ukraine. He asked that I quote him in full.
â€œTrump is a businessman and he does not want to give much military aid in general, and naturally not to corrupt governments who have in the past, according to Politico, tried to interfere in the 2016 election.â€
â€œTrump naturally takes the past Ukrainian efforts, again according to the 2017 Politico report, to harm his election effort, as a personal affront given they reportedly sought to stop Trump from becoming president and yet wanted him to reverse the Obama policy of no military aid once he was elected (which he did).â€
â€œOnce more, we are left with a supposed thought crime of considering delaying aid in exchange for Ukrainian promises of investigating 2016 interference in an American electionâ€”which never happened, but was actually reified by earlier suspension of actual Ukrainian investigations in 2016 (and possibly of Hunter Biden) and refusal to arm the Ukrainians.â€
But this argument has problems of its own. Fiona Hill and Vindman, both of whom served on Trumpâ€™s National Security Council, testified earlier this month that they had seen no evidence that the government of Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Hill added in testimony Thursday, â€œI refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a US adversary, and that Ukraine â€” not Russia â€” attacked us in 2016.â€
The Politico piece to which Hanson referred during our conversation notes that while some Ukrainian officials supported Clinton, their efforts were â€œfar less concerted or centrally directed than Russiaâ€™s alleged hacking and dissemination of Democratic emails,â€ which was a â€œtop-downâ€ effort. And according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, one of the main sources for allegations that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election â€” including allegations that they, not Russia, hacked the DNC â€” was Manafort himself.
3) â€œImpeaching a president is the most extreme and anti-democratic remedyâ€
But other conservatives have argued that Trumpâ€™s actions, even if tied to an â€œunderstandable and justifiableâ€ desire to investigate allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, were improper, inappropriate, or just plain bad.
As Townhall.com and Fox News commentator Guy Benson told me, those involved in the alleged quid pro quo â€œwere up to something that stunk.â€ â€œThey misused and abused their power,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s serious and it should be taken seriously.
But in his view, impeachment is a step too far. â€œMy case against impeachment and removal is that it rises to a thermonuclear option that has never been detonated before. Doing so based on this, so close to an election, in a presidentâ€™s first term, would do enormous damage.â€
Rather, he favors censure, a â€œvery rare toolâ€ last used against President Andrew Jackson in 1834 that would, as he wrote in October, â€œrepresent a severe and formal condemnation from the peopleâ€™s branch, and would constitute a stain on the presidentâ€™s term in office.â€
Daily Caller founders Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel have also argued that impeachment is too harsh a punishment for Trump. In an op-ed in October where they stipulated that â€œDonald Trump should not have been on the phone with a foreign head of state encouraging another country to investigate his political opponent,â€ they then wrote, â€œImpeaching a president is the most extreme and anti-democratic remedy we have in our system of government.â€
And they added:
The facts are out there for the American people to weigh as they make their decision. How about we let them sort all this out? Thereâ€™s no need to come up with thin excuses for a purely partisan impeachment process when we have an election right around the corner.
I spoke to Patel, who told me, â€œNancy Pelosi was right for all those months when she repeatedly said that to undo that election without bipartisan support based on clear criminal behavior would tear the country apart. We are on the eve of a new election where the American people can once again vote on Trump and this time they can weigh for themselves Trumpâ€™s behavior in this Ukraine affair. Thatâ€™s a much better solution.â€
4) â€œNo one caresâ€
But an even simpler defense of the president is one being made by Carlson on his Fox News show and by others within the conservative movement, and it actually doesnâ€™t require defending the president at all.
Instead, Republicans are arguing that the entire process is a â€œdistraction.â€ Moreover, theyâ€™re arguing that it doesnâ€™t matter what Trump did or didnâ€™t do because the Senate wonâ€™t vote to impeach the president and the average American doesnâ€™t care.
As Townhall.com writer Kurt Schlichter wrote earlier this week, â€œWeâ€™re too busy working, too focused on our 401(k)s going through the roof and on [Trump] flipping circuit courts like a boss, to care about the latest outrage to end all outrages.â€ I reached out to Schlichter and will update if and when I hear back.
On the November 15 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Carlson argued, â€œnormal peopleâ€ â€” â€œsomeone with kids and a job and a marriage you care aboutâ€ â€” arenâ€™t thinking about impeachment and would rather â€œthe buffoons on TV would stop yapping about Trump 24/7 and talk about something relevant.â€
Itâ€™s an argument being made by Republicans both inside and outside of the administration. For example, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted that instead of impeachment (which was â€œboringâ€ and a â€œwaste of timeâ€), â€œCongress should be working on passing USMCA, funding our govt & military, working on reduced drug pricing & so much more.â€
This argument seems somewhat self-refuting â€” after all, tweeting or writing or saying on national television that no one cares about impeachment would imply that someone, somewhere, decidedly does.
But for the GOP, it is perhaps the most revealing. Not of the sentiment of the average American â€” 70 percent of whom believe Trumpâ€™s actions regarding Ukraine were â€œwrongâ€ â€” but of the Republicans. Because they are well aware that within a slimmed-down Republican Party that has largely excised his enemies and detractors through retirements and election losses, Trump is the only available lodestar.
And so for them, it doesnâ€™t actually matter what Trump did with regard to Ukrainian military aid: whether he intended to hurt Joe Bidenâ€™s presidential hopes, whether he was genuinely concerned about corruption, or whether he did something that constitutes an impeachable offense. Trump is all theyâ€™ve got."
"The field of Democratic 2020 presidential contenders has narrowed, but there will still be 10 on stage Wednesday night for the fifth official televised debate in Atlanta, Georgia.
A recent poll, first reported by Emily Atkin at HEATED, showed that 71 percent of Democratic voters in Georgia want candidates to talk about climate change and that 70 percent think the federal government should be doing more to address it. The question is how much it will come up, and whether it will lead to a meaningful discussion.
Given what weâ€™ve seen in the other debates â€” a few scattered and shallow questions on climate, or none whatsoever â€” itâ€™s unlikely that the issue will get much attention Wednesday. In September, MSNBC and CNN devoted several hours of airtime to town halls with candidates to discuss how to cope with rising sea levels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the serial interview format meant that candidates couldnâ€™t challenge each other directly as they would during a debate.
Yet even as climate has been sidelined in the debates, the presidential candidates have been cranking out comprehensive strategies for dealing with it.
These plans show just how important the issue is in the 2020 race and how much the discussion has evolved in a short amount of time. No Democrat who has eyes on the White House can come to the table without a credible plan to limit greenhouse gases, adapt to rising seas, and to ensure a just transition toward a clean economy.
Much of the credit for this surge in attention goes to activists from groups like the Sunrise Movement. With their signature climate policy framework, the Green New Deal, Sunrise set the agenda for the climate discussion among candidates earlier this year.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee also deserves much credit. Though heâ€™s now out of the race, his campaignâ€™s singular focus on climate change set the policy benchmark against which other candidates are being compared. Fellow presidential contenders praised his agenda, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has hired some of his staffers.
As for the remaining candidatesâ€™ plans, most agree that climate change demands a policy response to zero out the countryâ€™s emissions. Where they differ is in how they want to get there, how they will draw on sources like nuclear power, how much federal government investment they need, and the political levers theyâ€™ll use to enact their visions.
Here is how 2020 Democratic presidential candidates intend to fight climate change
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT): With Inslee out of the race, Sandersâ€™s plan to combat climate change has become the yardstick for judging the other proposals on the table.
He has adopted the Green New Deal branding for his own proposal, which has the largest price tag in the field of 2020 presidential climate ambitions: $16.3 trillion. The money, according to Sanders, will come from sources including income taxes from 20 million new jobs, taxes on fossil fuels, defense budget savings from no longer protecting oil shipping, and selling power via federal power marketing authorities.
That money would then be spent on measures like a climate resilience fund, deploying renewable energy, building a high-voltage direct current network, and supporting the United Nations Green Climate Fund.
The plan also calls for zeroing out emissions from transportation and power generation by 2030. Sanders also takes the most aggressive line against the fossil fuel industry. In addition to raising taxes on the industry and pursuing civil litigation, Sanders wants criminal prosecution of greenhouse gas emitters like Exxon Mobil.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA): Fighting corruption and the influence of money in politics has been the central theme of Warrenâ€™s campaign for the White House. But rather than putting out one central climate change agenda, she has incorporated it into her proposals for public lands, the military, trade, US manufacturing, and climate risk disclosure. She also borrowed Insleeâ€™s vision for reaching 100 percent clean energy.
â€œWhen I first started thinking about how to describe what I will fight for when I run for president, I decided I wasnâ€™t going to do one climate plan,â€ she said during the CNN climate town hall. â€œI decided I was going to try to look at climate in every part of the plans Iâ€™m working on.â€
By framing climate change as an issue of economics, public resources, and national security instead of just as an environmental issue, Warren is laying out a climate case for the general election, not just the primary. It would keep climate change as a front-burner issue, even in the event of a recession or an international conflict, while perhaps drawing in voters who donâ€™t see climate change as a top-tier concern.
Andrew Yang: The entrepreneur is an unconventional candidate compared to the slate of current and former public officials running for the White House. So it isnâ€™t too surprising that he has a unique approach to climate change.
In addition to his signature proposal of a $1,000 per month â€œFreedom Dividend,â€ Yang has put out a long, technology-centered climate agenda that pursues energy sources like thorium-based nuclear energy. He aims to power the US completely by renewable energy by 2035 (itâ€™s unclear if nuclear, a clean but not renewable energy source, would be used toward that goal). The proposal also calls for research into some of the more controversial climate change mitigation approaches like geoengineering. This can include mirrors in space to reflect sunlight away or spraying particles into the air to cool the planet.
But unlike some of the other candidates, Yang is frank that there will be unavoidable consequences from climate change and that people will have to move as a result. His plan allocates $40 billion in grants for people in coastal areas to move inland, $30 billion for infrastructure like seawalls, and $25 billion for disaster planning. Itâ€™s bleak, but arguably prudent.
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA): During her time as Californiaâ€™s attorney general, Harris launched an investigation into oil giant Exxon Mobil to see whether the company lied to investors and to the public about what it knew about climate change.
She is leaning on this experience prosecuting polluters in her plan to fight climate change. Her $10 trillion plan includes many of the conventional provisions like public and private investment in projects such as job training, repairing water infrastructure, and switching to clean energy. But it also includes expanded access to the legal system for people to hold greenhouse gas emitters accountable.
â€œAccess to the courts is fundamental for Americans to hold polluters accountable,â€ her climate plan reads. â€œBy statutorily reinforcing standing for those harmed by pollution and strengthening counsel-access provisions, we can protect access to the courts for citizens seeking restitution for environmental and climate-related damages.â€
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg: The youngest candidate in the race, the 37-year-old says he has a personal stake in the low-carbon future. â€œBecause when weâ€™re talking about whether we hit this target of 2050, decarbonizing the economy,â€ he said during the CNN town hall. â€œLord willing I plan to be here. I would be in my 60s.â€
His suite of strategies to address climate change take pains to address impacts across all parts of the country, not just the coasts. He calls for equitable disaster relief funding, national extreme weather insurance, climate-smart agriculture, and regional hubs to increase resilience to local climate-related risks.
The plan would cost between $1.5 and $2 trillion and create instruments to limit greenhouse gases like a clean energy bank, tax credits for carbon capture, a transition fund for workers who might see their jobs disappear. The proposal also calls for a carbon tax with revenues distributed back to low- and middle-income Americans as a rebate.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN): The Minnesota senator has published a climate agenda to â€œmobilize the heartland and leave no one behind.â€ Her plan begins with executive actions to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, restore the Clean Power Plan, and sign legislation to reach net zero emissions by 2050. She estimated the cost of her proposal to be between $2 and $3 trillion, funded in large part by pricing carbon emissions.
Her tactics include a $1 trillion infrastructure package to modernize the power grid with union labor, retrofit buildings for energy efficiency, and implement new zoning policies with federal housing grants.
Klobuchar was skeptical about some of the elements of the Green New Deal, like reducing air travel, but she ultimately cosponsored the resolution. She also says that she will not ban fracking and is open to carbon capture for fossil fuels as well as nuclear energy.
Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): Booker has long framed environmental issues, including climate change, as social justice concerns. The transition toward clean energy needs to address the needs and grievances of marginalized communities.
His plans invests $3 trillion over ten years with the aim of reaching zero-carbon electricity production by 2030 and making the US economy carbon neutral by 2045. Booker wants to end fossil fuel development on public lands. He is also in favor of nuclear energy. â€œRight now nuclear is more than 50% of our non-carbon causing energy,â€ Booker said. â€œPeople who think that we can get there without nuclear being part of the blend just arenâ€™t looking at the facts.â€
He also said that rejoining the Paris agreement isnâ€™t enough and that the United States needs to take a more aggressive leadership role on climate change on the international stage. Though heâ€™s a vegan, Booker said that he isnâ€™t coming for anyoneâ€™s burgers, but says that US food production could be restructured in a way thatâ€™s more sustainable and more just for the farmers themselves.
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Biden has the distinction of introducing the first climate change bill in the Senate, way back in 1986.
His climate proposal is roughly in line with those from other candidates, pegged to the 2050 deadline. The mechanisms for hitting the target include changes to the US tax code; job training and other equity provisions for those most impacted by climate change and the shift away from fossil fuels; and diplomatic pressure on other countries to reduce their emissions.
The agenda calls for $1.7 trillion in federal spending over the next decade on these policies. Biden has also pledged to refuse fossil fuel funding, backed the Green New Deal, and supported holding a climate change debate. And in the first primary debate in June, Biden highlighted his commitment to electrifying the US vehicle fleet. â€œI would immediately insist that we in fact build 500,000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America, working with governors, mayors and others, so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2020 â€” by the year 2030,â€ he said.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI): Representing an island state threatened by sea level rise, she has frequently brought up the importance of tackling climate change during her time in office and on the campaign trail.
In 2017, Gabbard introduced one of the most aggressive bills to fight climate change, the OFF Fossil Fuels Act, which aims to move the entire US economy to 100 percent clean energy by 2035.
â€œWe have to address the seriousness of this threat and stop treating it like a political football,â€ she said during a campaign stop. â€œWe can and must do so by recognizing that the effects of climate change are threatening people in communities all across the country, whether youâ€™re in a Republican state or a Democratic state.â€
However, Gabbard has been more circumspect about the Green New Deal. She did not cosponsor the resolution and said was concerned about the â€œvagueness of the language,â€ but later said that she supports that carbon neutrality goals of the proposal. She also said she is reluctant to support nuclear energy without a permanent solution for nuclear waste.
Tom Steyer: The billionaire venture capitalist, who has qualified for the October debate, has already poured millions of dollars of his own money into an impeachment ad campaign and started his own climate nonprofit, NextGen America. His plan to combat climate change centers on justice, for marginalized communities and globally.
â€œThe United States must recognize both our historic responsibility for producing the bulk of planet-heating pollution and the great opportunity to lead the world by responding to this crisis,â€ his plan read.
It calls for $2 trillion in federal investment over 10 years and net-zero emissions by 2045. That money would be spent on programs including $250 billion on community climate bonds and creating a civilian climate corps. The proposal also calls for a cabinet-level position to coordinate a national climate change response effort.
Candidates that are still in the race but failed to qualify for the debate
Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO): The Colorado senator has laid out not just an agenda but an â€œenforceable timelineâ€ for climate action. Building on the net-zero by 2050 goal, Bennet wants to have a global climate summit in his first 100 days to set even more ambitious goals. (He does not explain what the summit will accomplish that dozens of similar summits havenâ€™t.)
He also calls for the creation of a climate bank to drive private sector financing of clean energy and climate resilience projects, to the tune of $10 trillion in the US and around the world. For utility customers, Bennet wants to establish the option of buying clean electricity.
However, Bennetâ€™s record on climate change might be tougher for environmental activists to support. He has backed natural gas as a â€œbridge fuelâ€ and supported new pipelines. On the campaign trail, he has been circumspect about the Green New Deal, declining to support or criticize it outright. However, he has pledged not to take fossil fuel money or funding from corporate PACs.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro: The fundamental injustice of climate change is that the people who contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most. Thatâ€™s why Castro is framing climate change as an issue of civil rights.
His proposal calls for $10 trillion over 10 years for clean energy and resilience to get to net-zero emissions by 2045. It also calls for new laws to combat environmental discrimination, more civil litigation from the Environmental Protection Agency, and direct the federal government to proactively protect low-income communities and communities of color from pollution.
Castro has also called for creating a new classification for refugees fleeing climate-related disasters. More than 140 million may be displaced as a result of climate change by 2050 according to the World Bank, and Castro wants to create a mechanism to help people before a disaster strikes.
Correction: An earlier version of the story misstated when Joe Biden first introduced his climate bill and when his campaign began publicly discussing a climate agenda."
"For at least the last 25 years, labor economists have been compiling reams of evidence trying to answer one big question: Do minimum wage laws cost us jobs?
In introductory economics courses, students are typically taught that setting price floors â€” on milk, oil, or labor â€” causes supply to exceed demand. In the case of labor, what that means is that if thereâ€™s a minimum wage, employersâ€™ demand for workers falls (because they cost more), and the supply of workers increases (because theyâ€™re promised more money) â€” meaning thereâ€™s unemployment, with all the costs and suffering that entails.
For a long time, thatâ€™s how the theory went. But in 1993, economists Alan Krueger and David Card brought hard data to bear on the question and published a groundbreaking paper that forced economists to reconsider the issue.
They surveyed more than 400 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania to see if employment growth was slower in New Jersey following an increase in the minimum wage. They found no evidence that it was.
Card and Krueger expanded their results into a well-regarded book, Myth and Measurement (1995), and the empirical literature on the question exploded after that.
In the ensuing quarter-century, economic research has put to rest what had been a fundamental assumption â€” that low minimum wages always cause major disemployment in the short run. Instead, researchers have discovered a gamut of results. Some have found real employment effects (if short of seriously disruptive effects as previously assumed), but a new evidence review finds that most studies have found small or no effects.
The comprehensive review of the evidence on minimum wages, conducted by Arindrajit Dube for the British government, seeks to summarize the current evidence base, a quarter-century after Card and Kruegerâ€™s pioneering work. Dube, a professor of economics at UMass Amherst, is one of the leading experts on the effects of minimum wage laws within economics, and his research has typically found small employment effects, if any, from the policy.
In his new paper, Dube finds that the average effect on employment across the studies he reviews is very close to zero â€” that is, in most of the high-quality studies he reviews, a few outliers aside, the number of jobs cost by minimum wage laws is negligible. They raise wages without much downside.
The review also builds on a paper in the Quarterly Journal of Economics by Dube, Doruk Cengiz, Attila Lindner, and Ben Zipperer that examined 138 different changes in the minimum wage from 1979 to 2016. The paper found that on average, â€œoverall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged over the five years following the increase.â€ Moreover, the paper identifies a macroeconomic quirk in the late 1980s/early 1990s that, once accounted for, helps resolve some disagreement in the literature.
The paper certainly doesnâ€™t put to rest the debate over minimum wage studies. Skeptics remain. There is still disagreement about the scale of employment effects, and about what new minimum wage laws setting minimums as high as $15 an hour could do.
We also donâ€™t know everything about why minimums donâ€™t seem to cause a huge amount of job loss. Firms seem to pass on some of the costs to consumers, and in some cases have â€œmonopsonyâ€ power: if employees have only a handful of potential employers to choose from, those employers can get away with paying workers less, because they have fewer exit options.
In some ways, this is the most vital research field at the moment. â€œItâ€™s much more interesting to think of the minimum wage as a flashlight into the labor market than to always wind up debating the employment effect,â€ Suresh Naidu at Columbia says.
But we do know a fair bit more than we did in 1993, and the evidence we have now suggests that in many cases minimum wages are a net good for workers â€” even if a few workers lose jobs, those costs are significantly outstripped by increased wages for workers who keep their jobs. Whether that will remain true with minimums of $15 or more, especially in rural areas, remains to be seen.
What the new evidence review says
Dubeâ€™s new review was conducted at the request of a surprising source: the Conservative government of the United Kingdom. The Conservative cabinet has proposed gradually raising the countryâ€™s minimum wage to Â£10.50 an hour (about $15) by 2024, whereas Labour wants to raise it to Â£10 an hour ($14.28) immediately. In sharp contrast to the US, the debate there is about the speed and level of minimum wage increases, rather than on whether or not they occur at all.
Dube thus focuses heavily on the UKâ€™s own experience launching a national minimum wage in 1998, exactly 60 years after the US set a national minimum. But he also reviews the evidence in the US, including more recent studies in cities like Seattle, Chicago, Washington DC, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose, as well as studies examining minimum wage increases in Hungary and Germany. Dube collects 55 estimates of the minimum wageâ€™s impact on employment across the world, including 36 estimates from the US, and two estimates for the US and UK that he produced for the report.
Throughout he seeks to estimate the â€œown-wage elasticityâ€ (OWE) in each context: the increase in wages for a given group caused by an increase in the minimum wage, divided by the change in that groupâ€™s probability of employment caused by the minimum wage increase. An OWE of negative 1, for instance, is a â€œbreak-evenâ€ number: If wages for, say, fast food workers rise 10 percent following a minimum wage increase, then an OWE of -1 suggests odds of employment would fall 10 percent in turn.
The median study looking at a broad group of low-wage workers estimates an â€œelasticityâ€ of -0.04; that is, a 25-percent increase in average wages for a given group due to a minimum wage increase should lead to a 1 percent decline in employment for that group. Thatâ€™s a really small effect, and one that suggests the benefits of a modest minimum wage hike should swamp the costs.
Arindrajit Dube, University of Massachusetts Amherst, National Bureau of Economic Research and IZA Institute of Labor Economics
Studies looking at smaller groups of workers more likely to be bound by a minimum wage, like teenagers, find bigger effects: if you include studies looking at any size of group, the average OWE is -0.17. But that still implies that disemployment effects are swamped by higher wages.
That evidence base is enough for many labor economists, like Harvardâ€™s Larry Katz, to conclude that we know reasonably well that modest minimum wage increases do more good than harm. â€œIâ€™ve had many students on both sides of these debates,â€ Katz says. â€œWhen [minimum wages] affect non-traded goods sectors, which is largely true in the US, they clearly increase the wages for low-wage workers impacted. They seem to have very modest impacts on employment.â€
The evolution of minimum wage studies
Dubeâ€™s review is the latest salvo in a contentious debate that has evolved in interesting directions. When modern minimum wage research began in the 1990s, there were two dominant approaches.
One approach, pioneered by Card and Krueger, compared border counties in neighboring states, one of which increased the minimum wage and one of which didnâ€™t. The other, used by UC Irvineâ€™s David Neumark and the Fed Board of Governorsâ€™ William Wascher, tracked employment in full states over time, to see if employment fell in the wake of a minimum wage increase. The two methodologies tended to get different results: Card and Krueger, of course, found no employment effects, while Neumark and Wascher tended to find substantial job loss following minimum wage increases.
Each approach, however, had drawbacks. Card and Kruegerâ€™s approach focused on one specific case â€” New Jerseyâ€™s minimum wage hikes â€” that might not generalize to the country as a whole. The minimum wage increase also might have forced Pennsylvania employers to raise their wages in response, which could make Pennsylvania a bad control group: itâ€™s not unaffected by the minimum wage increase in New Jersey, itâ€™s also affected.
The Neumark/Wascher approach, by contrast, relied on comparisons between states that might otherwise be very different. There are a million reasons why, say, employment might have grown more slowly in California following a minimum wage increase than in Arizona. Neumark and Wascher generally used few â€œcontrolâ€ variables in an effort to keep the comparison clean and avoid â€œover-controllingâ€ and accidentally ignoring effects that are due to the minimum wage, but critics argued this could lead them to erroneously blame the minimum wage for job losses that were totally unrelated.
The varying approaches could lead to different evidence reviews drawing quite different conclusions. A 2007 paper by Neumark and Wascher concluded that the â€œmost credibleâ€ studies found that the minimum wage costs a substantial number of jobs. Meanwhile, a paper by Dale Belman and Paul Wolfson first published in 2015 found that most credible research estimates minimal effect on jobs.
One thing that happened between 2007 and 2015 is that economists devised better methods. Researchers led by Dube have pioneered a new method of border-county comparisons that extends nationally: starting in a 2010 paper, Dube, T. William Lester, and Michael Reich compared â€œall contiguous county-pairs in the United States that are located on opposite sides of a state border,â€ a vast expansion of the general Card-Krueger approach. That creates a much larger sample and enables a nationwide study, rather than one limited to just, say, New Jersey.
That study found no noticeable effect on employment. It also tested for spillovers â€” an increased minimum wage in one state raising wages in the state next door â€” and found they were negligible.
More recently in their 2019 Quarterly Journal of Economics paper, Dube, Cengiz, Lindner, and Zipperer find that much of the disagreement between the Card/Krueger and Neumark/Wascher approaches is attributable to a quirk in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During that period, blue states experienced an economic downturn relative to red states that predated the biggest blue state minimum wage increases; that made it look like minimum wages were lowering employment growth, when what was really happening was that blue states both had lower employment growth and separately increased their minimum wages.
â€œIn our QJE paper we showed that the specifications under argument (lot of controls, little controls) actually all suggest little job loss in the post 1995 period; and that this appears to be driven by the quirky 80s boom/bust,â€ Dube told me. â€œNone of us knew this until recently. This is actually progress.â€
What skeptics argue
But new research arguing for substantial disemployment effects has emerged too. Jonathan Meer of Texas A&M and Jeremy West of UC Santa Cruz in a 2016 paper found that while short-run employment isnâ€™t affected by increases in the minimum wage, states that raised their minimums saw slower job growth in subsequent years.
This makes some intuitive sense: you might expect a coffee shop that sees its wage minimum rise from $9 to $12, say, to not actively lay off any employees, but to hire fewer people in the future. Meer and West argued that focusing on employment levels, rather than rates, produced much of the disagreement in the literature up to that point, because it made estimates sensitive to what trends in employment existed before the minimum wage increase.
This led to a fierce back and forth between Meer and West and Dube. Dube in a 2013 study argued that the job growth slowdown in Meer and West showed up disproportionately in manufacturing, where wages are too high to be affected by the minimum wage, suggesting that their model picked up some noise that wasnâ€™t related to the minimum wage at all â€” and added that using his methodology to look at employment growth, you didnâ€™t find any effects at all.
Meer and West countered that when you add appropriate controls, the industries seeing slower job growth arenâ€™t weird or surprising; a recent paper by Doruk Cengiz using machine learning to decompose the employment effects that Meer and West discuss suggests theyâ€™re mostly among higher-wage individuals, which bolsters Dubeâ€™s critique.
Another skeptic, UC San Diegoâ€™s Jeffrey Clemens, had one paper included in Dubeâ€™s review. Written with Michael Wither, it estimated significant job losses due to the 2007 increase in the federal minimum wage amidst the Great Recession.
Clemens argues that other important studies did not get sufficient emphasis in Dubeâ€™s review. He names, for instance, a paper by MITâ€™s John Horton where an online labor market â€” itâ€™s not Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk, but thatâ€™s a good comparison â€” randomly imposed minimum wages for some firms posting jobs, and not others. The firms with minimums reduced hiring and hours worked, pivoting away from low-productivity workers to high-productivity ones. Thatâ€™s a true experiment, and one that suggests some disemployment effects.
Clemens also points to a Danish study examining youth employment. Denmarkâ€™s union-negotiated minimum wages kick in at age 18, and, sure enough, the study finds that employment drops by a third when 17-year-olds turn 18, suggesting large-scale unemployment due to a minimum wage.
Dube actually did include this one in his study, but notes itâ€™s a very different policy from a broad-based minimum wage. â€œEmployers can costlessly substitute higher paid, slightly older workers for identical but lower-paid, slightly younger ones,â€ in Denmark, he says. â€œThere is very clear reason why youâ€™d expect more job loss in this context, but there is no equivalent for this for, say, a broad based minimum wage policy.â€
The online and Denmark studies use extremely credible designs that are arguably better than most of the cross-border or cross-state comparisons that dominate minimum wage research. But they lack â€œexternal validityâ€: itâ€™s not clear that an online task marketplace is a good model for the US labor market, to say the least, and the Denmark example has the problems that Dube notes.

A $15 minimum wage
Another study that Dube includes in his review deserves special comment.
Seattle, Washington was one of the first major cities to vote to gradually increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and the University of Washington has been conducting a large-scale ongoing study to see what effect that hike has. The most recent report from the study suggests that increasing the minimum to $13 an hour reduced work hours, but raised wages by enough that low-income workers as a whole were better off on average. That doesnâ€™t mean that all low-income workers were better off, though, and the study suggests that many had to find work outside Seattle to supplement their incomes.
An earlier study from the project found much larger negative effects on employment. That study came under intense criticism for data limitations (it doesnâ€™t include employers with locations both in Seattle and outside, because the part of Washington outside of Seattle serves as the control group). The effects it estimated were extremely large relative to other studies in the literature, and many labor economists like Harvardâ€™s Lawrence Katz donâ€™t find the research reliable. â€œThe Seattle study is completely uninformative because thereâ€™s no comparison group for Seattle,â€ Katz says. â€œItâ€™s the fastest growing labor market weâ€™ve basically ever seen.â€
Reliable or not, the Seattle studies have gotten outsized attention because they represent the first wave of studies on the new mega-increases in the minimum wage following the Fight for $15 movement. California, DC, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York are all gradually increasing their minimums to $15 an hour; even more rural/lower-wage states like Arkansas, Maine, and Missouri are gradually increasing their minimums to $11 or $12.
Dube notes in his review that the best evidence we have suggests minimal job impacts on minimum wages of up to 60 percent of the median wage. The median hourly wage in El Centro, California is about $15.50, meaning the $13 an hour minimum (effective January 1 of next year) is over 80 percent of the median wage there. The effects there might be very different.
Dube addresses this concern in his review, noting that a recent study looking at counties that have already raised their minimum wages to over 80 percent of the median wage still found minimal effects.
But thereâ€™s sure to be additional research as the new wages are phased in, and everyone in the debate, from Dube to Meer, thinks thereâ€™s some point where the disemployment effects become too large. What we donâ€™t know is if any wage increases passed to this point will reach that level.
â€œMost of the $15 minimum wage proposals are phased in over multiple years and are probably like $11/$12 today,â€ Katz notes. â€œIf you told me weâ€™re going to $15 tomorrow I would worry about low-wage states. If you told me over five, six, seven years, Iâ€™m not super-worried.â€
Clemens and AEIâ€™s Michael Strain are doing precommitted studies on the minimum wage â€” where they agree to use a certain kind of analysis ahead of time â€” to ensure they donâ€™t change analytical method to get a specific result later. So far theyâ€™ve found mixed results, with bigger job losses from bigger increases and little effect from smaller increases in the minimum wage. And theyâ€™re hardly the only ones who will be looking.
This debate will rage for a while
Itâ€™s easy to become pessimistic about the prospect that new research can dissolve old disagreements. Economists Zubin Jelveh, Bruce Kogut, and Suresh Naidu have found that you can predict, pretty accurately, most economistsâ€™ views on whether the minimum wage costs jobs based on their existing political leanings.
That doesnâ€™t mean that the researchers working on the question are dishonest â€” everyone agrees that Dube, Neumark, etc. are all incredibly smart conscientious researchers who just happen to disagree on this topic. But it does reflect that there are structural forces at work here. There are big monied interests opposed to minimum wage increases, and smaller but real monied interests (specifically unions) supportive of them, and that political economy naturally leads to a polarized knowledge base over time.
â€œYouâ€™ve got to make some normative judgments, which make economists really uncomfortable,â€ Strain says. Is it worth accepting a risk of higher disemployment for higher wages overall â€” which seems to be a reliable result of minimum wage increases? How high a risk of disemployment are you willing to accept so that the workers who donâ€™t get laid off get raises?
At this point, personally, I think the trade-off at most margins suggests a higher minimum wage is a good idea. As Dubeâ€™s review suggests, most estimates of the employment elasticity arenâ€™t close to -1, despite some studies finding effects in that range. Thatâ€™s a wonky way of saying that even if employment falls, it falls by less than wages rise by, and as such the benefits for low-wage workers seem to swamp any employment effects.
Iâ€™ve very open to that changing as minimums get higher. But we do seem to have learned something very important since the initial Card/Krueger wave: the old assumption that minimum wages are always unacceptably distortionary doesnâ€™t really hold water. Theyâ€™re often beneficial and at what point they stop being beneficial is something we can test empirically rather than relying just on theory.

"Six former Real Housewives are sitting onstage in a packed ballroom in Manhattan when an audience member, during a question and answer portion, politely asks if Caroline Manzo would be willing to throw a slice of ham at him. Like, at his face. Caroline, the redheaded ex-matriarch of the Real Housewives of New Jersey with infinite quotable insults (â€œyou hang out with trash, you start to smell like garbageâ€) and possible mafia ties, of course, says yes. So the guy gets on stage, ham in hand, and Caroline flogs him with lunch meat.
The request is a reference to a scene from season two, way back in 2010, when Manzoâ€™s three adult children are making sandwiches and suddenly start throwing ham at each other. Itâ€™s also indicative of a certain kind of rhetoric common in online fandoms, wherein the fan expresses their adoration by asking the celebrity to run them over or fling them from a building. That to be in the presence of the object of their admiration is worth being humiliated, or murdered.
We are at the first-ever BravoCon, a three-day event where 10,000 people have paid between $125 for a one-day general admission pass and $1,500 for a three-day super VIP package to get close to to their favorite stars. Attendees, most of them women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, look not unlike â€œBravolebritiesâ€ themselves: They have perfect TV blowouts and wear leopard print and are drinking wine before noon; in an alternate timeline they could have been the ones onstage throwing ham at people. They are here alongside the stars of reality shows like Southern Charm, Million Dollar Listing, Below Deck, and the networkâ€™s crown jewel, the Real Housewives franchise, for panel discussions and photo ops devoted to the celebration of what can only be described as the Bravo Extended Universe.
That universe, which began in 2006 with the Real Housewives of Orange County, is wide-reaching, ever-growing, and comfortingly cohesive â€” at BravoCon, executive producer Andy Cohen announced the addition of the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, where fans will watch the same slice of wealthy socialites theyâ€™ve come to expect â€” except this time, with Mormons. Spinoffs are frequent: The biggest stars sometimes get miniseries in the lead-up to a big life event, like a wedding; one former Atlanta housewife has carried her own show since 2012; and one of the networkâ€™s most successful shows, Vanderpump Rules, began as a spinoff of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Every weeknight, stars from the Bravo universe congregate on Cohenâ€™s talk show, Watch What Happens Live, to gossip and share news from their corners of the galaxy.

Over the past decade and change, this web of television shows has amassed a cultish, millions-strong following of superfans who pour over the details of reality starsâ€™ lives and now, have traveled to New York City to pose for pictures with them. Though I am here as a journalist, I also count myself among them: people who have spent countless hours watching the networkâ€™s shows, following Bravo gossip Instagram accounts, listening to more than one Bravo podcast, and breathlessly discussing news in Housewives Facebook groups and Slack rooms. That BravoCon â€” an intricately orchestrated production that involved three locations, a pop-up museum, a 2,000-audience-member episode of Watch What Happens Live, and the handling of dozens of professionally high-maintenance celebrities â€” can even exist and succeed is a testament to fansâ€™ unwavering loyalty to watching other peopleâ€™s lives.
â€œHousewives fans are like sports fans,â€ remarked Kyle Richards, a Beverly Hills housewife, during the WWHL taping. Thatâ€™s not actually true, though â€” theyâ€™re way more into it.
How Bravo built an empire out of a single reality show
Bravo used to be fancy. At its founding in 1980, there were no commercials, and programming included classic films, ballets, and operas. Then in 2002, NBC bought Bravo and shortly thereafter pivoted to the then-buzzy genre of reality television, beginning with Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and eventually Project Runway, Top Chef, and the Real Housewives of Orange County.
The latter was meant to act more like an anthropological nature documentary than the wine-slinging, wig-pulling reputation it earned in later years. Riding off the success of ABCâ€™s Desperate Housewives and Foxâ€™s The O.C., the show fixated on five women living in a gated community in Coto de Caza, and only occasionally showed them interacting with each other, much less actually fighting.

â€œI thought I was just helping out a friend,â€ says Jeana Keough, one of the original cast members when I meet her in the BravoCon press room. â€œ[Executive producer] Scott Dunlap was my neighbor, and for years heâ€™d say, â€˜I want to do a Curb Your Enthusiasm show about your family.â€™â€
She gives partial credit to the 2007 Writersâ€™ Guild of America strike for the early success of the show â€” it was one of the few that didnâ€™t have much use for writers, after all. But itâ€™s what Bravo ended up doing with that success â€” replicating the formula seamlessly into nine more cities and endless spinoffs â€” that created a single, shiny universe where all the Bravo stars seemed to reside, launching businesses and shilling products so that even viewers could buy their way into it.
BravoCon attendees I spoke to recalled getting hooked on a single show â€” The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills or Million Dollar Listing, before eventually watching enough Bravo shows that theyâ€™re now fully invested in whether one employee of an ex-Housewife Photoshopped text messages to claim that she slept with a different former employee. Bravo has become a cultural behemoth, one that has been discussed and debated for more than 10 years â€” whether it is good or bad, real or fake, trash TV or high camp.
Yes, the stereotype of the Real Housewives being about a bunch of wealthy middle-aged women screaming at each other has some basis in truth. While the early episodes of Orange County were relatively light on interpersonal drama, by the time New York and Atlanta debuted in 2008, the Housewives formula had been tweaked to ensure rivalries would ensue. There have been physical fights. At times the women say unfathomably cruel things to each other. There have also been extraordinarily dark moments â€” women relapsing on their sobriety, women being domestically abused, women finding out while on camera that their mother has died; women dealing with addiction and infidelity and divorce and depression.

These issues are also what give the Real Housewives themselves a degree of relatability despite their fabulous wealth. â€œRelatableâ€ was a refrain I heard multiple times at BravoCon from both fans and stars, as reasons for the showâ€™s massive success, which I found somewhat paradoxical. For as foreign as starting a cancer charity after youâ€™ve been accused of helping someone fake cancer or spending $60,000 on a 4-year-oldâ€™s birthday party is to most people, everyone can understand the experience of feeling excluded or bullied. Drama ranges from serious marital issues and impending financial doom to pure petty gossip; on any episode of a Bravo show thereâ€™s something for everyone to theoretically â€œrelateâ€ to, even if the trappings of the starsâ€™ lives include indoor pools and living room-sized closets. However dark a show gets, thereâ€™s at least usually a nice kitchen to look at.
â€œRelatabilityâ€ gets more complicated, however, when considering the Housewives franchiseâ€™s track record with race. Shows have historically been divided, with Atlanta and Potomac primarily centered on black women and the others largely white; a few months ago, the announcement that Beverly Hills will soon feature its first black cast member was major news. Though Bravo shows include a breadth of racial and sexual diversity, Housewives has always been mostly segregated. Who gets to relate to which Housewife, then, becomes more complicated.
Even so, Housewives fans themselves are diverse â€” the tenor of the conversation these days celebrates how so many of its fans are feminists, women, gay men, and queer people who digest the shows with both earnestness and irony, and who understand that the Real Housewives is best viewed as fun escapism rather than something prescriptive or aspirational.
Why we keep watching Bravo â€” and why Bravolebrities keep opting in
Weâ€™re in line to take photos with a handful of men from the Bravo universe â€” Craig of Southern Charm, a show about old-money millennials in Charleston; and the Toms (Sandoval and Schwartz) of Vanderpump Rules â€” when I meet three women whoâ€™ve traveled to BravoCon from Washington, DC, and Seattle. They have â€œkind of important jobs,â€ they laugh; one is a lawyer, another works in climate communications, and the third is a planned gift fundraiser. â€œItâ€™s really nice to come home and unwind and enjoy the irreverence and silliness and drama,â€ says one of them, Amy.
Mary, the lawyer, says, â€œI also, well, I always just want to yell at people all day at work and I canâ€™t. So itâ€™s nice to see these people just openly yelling at each other, which I know isnâ€™t a great reason, but I also really dig it. Even in their theoretical worst moments, they are freaking hilarious.â€

Itâ€™s true. The Real Housewives, Vanderpump Rules, Southern Charm, and all the other Bravo shows are truly funny, which is in part thanks to clever editing but mostly due to smart casting; as former New York Housewife Heather Thomson once told the New York Post, â€œThey donâ€™t care if [a potential Housewife] is skinny, fat, young or old â€” she just has to be funny. [Producers] need someone who is quick-witted and the queen of the one-liner.â€ (Though the claim that producers donâ€™t care if a Housewife is fat is most certainly a lie.)
It also explains the myriad meme T-shirts I saw at BravoCon: Bethenny Frankelâ€™s #thisisacrisis T-shirt, one that just said â€œJovani!â€, â€œJune, June, Hannahâ€ for Below Deck, and â€œYeah, Iâ€™m drinking Luann!â€
At the merch station, there are T-shirts that say â€œI need my own Bravo show.â€ Thatâ€™s part of the fun of Bravo, too: imagining what youâ€™d be like as a waiter at SUR on Vanderpump Rules (theyâ€™re called SURvers) or whether you would have sided with NeNe or Cynthia in season six and seven of Atlanta (obviously Cynthia!).
BravoCon knows this â€” there are special â€œexperiencesâ€ where you can film your own Housewives intro while a producer eggs you on in front of a wind machine. Thereâ€™s a Housewife Hall where you can pose next to neon signs blaring the franchiseâ€™s most iconic quotes and oil paintings of dramatic reunion moments, and an entire museum with important memorabilia, including but not limited to: Lisa Rinnaâ€™s sandwich bag of pills, an installation of Dorinda Medleyâ€™s infamous fish-themed guest room in her Berkshires mansion, a replica of Dorit Kemsleyâ€™s blonde wig and dozens of gaudy bejeweled hair clips, and Tamra Judgeâ€™s old breast implants.
Everywhere at BravoCon there are goofy mementos of Bravo wit: Bathrooms are plastered in phrases like â€œPat the pussâ€ and â€œClose your legs to married men;â€ a sign reading â€œItâ€™s all happeningâ€ welcomes visitors to the main ballroom, a reference to Vanderpump Rules cast member Scheana Shayâ€™s enormous forearm tattoo.

It is playful, and it is not always clear whether the Bravolebrities are the butt of the joke. Being on a television show that demands constant access to every wrinkle in your personal life is not always a pleasant experience, even when youâ€™re technically getting paid. Andy Cohen, for his part, doesnâ€™t entertain the idea that the show harms its stars. When Taffy Brodesser-Akner profiled him in 2017 and asked whether he felt bad for the Housewives, he shook his head. â€œIâ€™m in a business relationship with these women,â€ he said. â€œThey know what theyâ€™re doing.â€
As much as it is known for riveting personal drama, the Bravo universe is now known as an incubator for celebrity side hustles. The most successful example is Bethenny Frankelâ€™s diet margarita concept Skinnygirl. But now, nearly everyone who appears on a Bravo show is there to promote something else â€” a fragrance, a budding pop music career, pink dog food, or if all else fails, an Instagram account. These products â€” from Vicki Gunvalsonâ€™s vodka, Vickiâ€™s Vodka, to ShereÃ© Whitfieldâ€™s She By ShereÃ© jogger line â€” extend the Bravo universe to your living room, and the many food and beverage products are often meant to be enjoyed while watching the show. If buying one of them means purchasing your way into Bravodom, then a ticket to BravoCon is the ultimate get.
Still, there are some Housewives for whom any business deal, no matter how lucrative, would seem insufficient to negate the effects of appearing on the franchise. I am interviewing Kim Richards at BravoCon after the panel for Housewives â€œOGsâ€ when I ask why she kept coming back to the show even after her first few seasons proved so tumultuous. Richards had one of the darkest arcs in Housewives history: The former child star struggled with alcoholism and relapses in sobriety, ultimately culminating in an arrest for public intoxication, and drunken screaming matches with her sister, fellow Beverly Hills cast member Kyle Richards.

â€œWhat brought me back was I really wanted the audience to see it,â€ she says, referring to her health struggles. It is at this point that she begins to cry. â€œThe fans may come back because they end up getting attached to us. A lot of people identified with [me] because they were there. And then they saw me get better. They might have family members, they might have a mother, a sister [dealing with similar issues].â€
Tom Sandoval of Vanderpump Rules told me, while in full drag, that there are three reasons he keeps coming back to the show. â€œFirst of all, itâ€™s therapeutic. Second, it pays the bills. Third, itâ€™s a blast and itâ€™s like, a reciprocal relationship to some extent. Like when I meet fans of the show, itâ€™s very cathartic. We talk about similar instances theyâ€™ve been through in life, then we have a heart-to-hearts. Itâ€™s like an instantaneous bond.â€
To be perfectly honest, I felt like Tom and I were already friends by the time weâ€™d met, and I remembered that at a panel earlier that morning, Andy Cohen had surveyed the ballroom and told the audience, â€œThese are your new best friends,â€ referring to the people sitting next to us. The people on stage were already our best friends, though â€” women weâ€™ve watched for more than a decade. We knew exactly what kinds of fights theyâ€™d get in with their husbands, weâ€™d seen their children grow up, we saw them get drunk on vacation and say things like â€œIâ€™m sorry you feel that way.â€ Because I was there without my friends and family, with whom I talk obsessively about the Bravo universe, I felt a dull sense of loneliness, reminding me of how much more fun it would have been had I come with someone else.
It was pure coincidence that the second BravoCon attendee I spoke to also happened to run a Bravo Instagram account that I and 45,000 other people follow. Katie and Betsy, the proprietors of @twobravosisters, never had much in common growing up until they both communicated their shared love of Bravo. â€œWe werenâ€™t very close, so we were like, â€˜Letâ€™s do this to try to contact each other and talk more and bring us together,â€™â€ says Betsy.
â€œWe went from talking twice a year to twice a day,â€ Katie adds. â€œWeâ€™ve just been crazy about Bravo and closer as sisters.â€

My sister and I, too, bond over Bravo, much to the annoyance of our parents who have zero clue who Austen or Ashley or Gina or Dorinda are and why we know so much about their lives. Bravo, like any fandom, is social, and BravoCon is the homecoming dance, where everyone dresses up to gossip about the kings and queens.
Itâ€™s just before the big Watch What Happens Live taping, and weâ€™re waiting outside in the dark as the Bravolebrities begin to exit their shiny black vans and into the backstage area. Brittany and Katie from Vanderpump Rules pass through to dozens of screaming fans, followed by Stassi, Lala, and Lalaâ€™s enigmatic fiancÃ© Randall. The â€œtres amigasâ€ of the OC Housewives â€” Shannon, Tamra, and Vicki â€” roll through next, Shannon hand-in-hand with her very new boyfriend, the first man sheâ€™s dated publicly since her ex-husband David revealed that heâ€™d had a long-term affair a few seasons ago. In the aftermath, her erratic mental health, financial struggles, and weight gain became a central storyline on the show, but today sheâ€™s beaming, mouthing â€œoh my godâ€ at the number of people waiting to catch a glimpse of her.
As I head to the ballroom for the show, I overhear a fan say, â€œThereâ€™s like, every celebrity you can think of here!â€

"During an impeachment hearing Tuesday, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes praised the reporting of a â€œveteran investigative journalistâ€ whose work had proven to be a â€œproblem for the Democratsâ€ and the media.
That journalist is John Solomon, formerly of the Hill and currently a Fox News contributor. Republicans like Nunes have relied on Solomonâ€™s work during the impeachment inquiry to build the case that Trump was right to be concerned about former Vice President Joe Bidenâ€™s actions in Ukraine and those of his son, Hunter Biden, and to argue that the â€œrealâ€ scandal is how the Obama administration tried to get the Ukrainian government to cover up corruption.
But Solomonâ€™s â€œjournalism,â€ particularly on the subject of Ukraine, has been proven to be false, repeatedly. Solomon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Substantial reporting from outlets including ProPublica and the Daily Beast show that Solomon spread disinformation about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and the former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. In his work, he effectively laundered dirt provided to him by Donald Trumpâ€™s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, producing articles that directly led to a whistleblower report alleging that Trump, based on Solomonâ€™s false assertions, demanded the Ukrainian government investigate the Bidens or risk losing military aid.
The foremost allegation made by Solomon was published by the Hill in March, when Solomon interviewed the former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko. In the interview, he accused then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch of giving him a do-not-prosecute list to stop investigations into corruption. The accusation was proved false, and was ultimately recanted by Lutsenko himself â€” but by then, it was too late.
The falsehood had made it into the right-leaning media ecosystem, where other false allegations surfaced, like that Yovanovitch was anti-Trump and told Ukrainians to ignore him because he would soon be impeached. She was fired from her post in May of this year.
Trump was seemingly laser-focused on Yovanovitch, even referencing her in his infamously â€œperfectâ€ call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as being â€œbad news.â€ But Yovanovitchâ€™s real crime appears to have been standing in the way of Rudy Giuliani, and, more importantly, his efforts to investigate Joe Biden on behalf of the presidentâ€™s reelection efforts, according to statements made by the former mayor to the Wall Street Journal.
As Republicans continue to dig in on impeachment, Solomon represents a media figure with mainstream credentials those supportive of Trump can use to burnish their views and their defenses of the president. But ironically, itâ€™s Solomon, and Solomonâ€™s misinformation stemming from Giuliani and others, that is responsible for the impeachment inquiry in the first place.
Solomonâ€™s conspiracy theories came from Rudy Giuliani and his allies
This spring, John Solomon, then the executive vice president of digital at the Hill, posted an interview with former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko, whom Solomon introduced as a â€œheroâ€ who spent two years in prison for battling Russian â€œaggression.â€
But that interview was actually part of a long-running smear campaign by Giuliani aimed at undermining the Ukrainian ambassador to help Trump.
As my colleague Andrew Prokop reported:
According to the accounts of other witnesses who have testified in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch was highly respected among her colleagues. But she ran afoul of two powerful people: Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general (under the previous administration) Yuri Lutsenko.
In an apparent effort to win President Trumpâ€™s favor, Lutsenko and Giuliani began discussing the possibility that the Ukrainian prosecutor general could launch investigations into Trumpâ€™s enemies. Heâ€™d investigate Burisma (the Ukrainian natural gas company whose board included Hunter Biden) as well as purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
But Yovanovitch got in the way. When Lutsenko asked the US embassy to set up meetings with FBI or Justice Department officials, she objected, saying thatâ€™s not the typical way these things are handled. Instead, she encouraged him to meet with the FBIâ€™s legal attachÃ© in Kyiv. â€œI donâ€™t think he really appreciated it,â€ she told investigators.
Solomonâ€™s interview made a blockbuster (and false) assertion: Yovanovitch had given Lutsenko a â€œdo-not-prosecuteâ€ list that included a founder of an anti-corruption group, Anti-Corruption Action Centre (AntAc). That group, according to Solomon, was funded by Hungarian-American billionaire (and conservative boogeyman) George Soros.
Solomon wrote that â€œthe implied message to Ukraineâ€™s prosecutors was clear: Donâ€™t target AntAC in the middle of an America presidential election in which Soros was backing Hillary Clinton to succeed another Soros favorite, Barack Obama, Ukrainian officials said.â€
But there was no â€œdo-not-prosecuteâ€ list, which Lutsenko himself admitted a few weeks later. AntAc was funded by a host of entities, including donations from Ukrainian citizens and the European Union; the United States; the governments of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic; alongside the Open Society Foundations, a Soros-developed grantmaking group. Lutsenko didnâ€™t spend time in prison in retaliation for his efforts against Russia â€” he was sent to prison for embezzlement and abuse of office, two years before Russia became making incursions into Ukraine.
And in other articles for the Hill, Solomon made more false assertions about perceived enemies of Trump.
For example, he wrote that Joe Biden had pressured Ukraine to remove former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in order to shut down an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board included Bidenâ€™s son, Hunter Biden. Those allegations were turned into a 30-second attack ad for the Trump campaign on Facebook, viewed more than five million times. But former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that Bidenâ€™s demand for Shokinâ€™s firing was not at all improper â€” and Biden was hardly alone in wanting Shokin, who was reportedly engaged in corrupt behavior, removed.
Solomon further wrote that a so-called black ledger that showed off-the-books payments made to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort by a pro-Russian political party â€” payments that resulted in Manafortâ€™s resignation from the campaign â€” was fake. But that ledger is absolutely real.
In summary, Solomon falsely asserted that Democrats worked with Ukrainian officials to help spread falsehoods about Trump campaign officials and quash investigations into Joe Bidenâ€™s son, and that Yovanovitch had kept Ukrainian officials who might blow the whistle on the alleged scheme from entering the country. But none of that was true.
Solomonâ€™s work relied heavily on information fed to him by Rudy Giuliani, who orchestrated, in the words of senior State Department official George Kent, a â€œcampaign ... full of lies and incorrect informationâ€ aimed at getting rid of Yovanovitch by connecting her to George Soros and a conspiratorial effort to help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election â€” a theory that former National Security Council official Fiona Hill told Congress earlier this month seemed based on the falsehood that â€œGeorge Soros rules the world and, you know, basically controls everything.â€
Giuliani sent a host of memos containing misinformation to Solomon. As Jeremy Peters and Kenneth Vogel of the New York Times detailed:
In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said he turned to Mr. Solomon earlier this year with a cache of information he believed contained damaging details about Mr. Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, and the special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIâ€™s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. â€œI really turned my stuff over to John Solomon,â€ Mr. Giuliani said. â€œI had no other choice,â€ he added, asserting that Obama-era officials still â€œinfectedâ€ the Justice Department and wouldnâ€™t have diligently investigated the information he had compiled.
â€œSo I said hereâ€™s the way to do it â€” Iâ€™m going to give it to the watchdogs of integrity, the fourth estate,â€ he said.
Giulianiâ€™s interest in smearing Yovanovitch centered on her refusal to permit a politically motivated investigation into the Bidens. But Giuliani also worked with two Ukrainian businessmen, Lev Parnas and his partner, Igor Fruman, to spread disinformation about Joe Biden and Yovanovitch, and they had motivations of their own.
As detailed by the New York Times in October, â€œMr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman boasted that they had worked with Mr. Giuliani to force the recall this spring of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch,â€ partly because Parnas believed Yovanovitch was getting in the way of his work in the oil industry. (Both have recently been indicted on campaign finance charges.)
Remember that Solomon interview with Lutsenko, in which Lutsenko said that he had received a â€œdo-not-prosecuteâ€ list from the American ambassador? Parnas set up the interview, and according to ProPublica, watched the interview from the control booth.
More concerningly, Solomon was introduced to Parnas by his personal attorneys, Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, who had worked with Giuliani previously and, according to Fox News, were helping the former New York City mayor â€œto get oppo research on Biden.â€
It was diGenova who was the source of the smear against Yovanovitch regarding her â€œanti-Trumpâ€ status, saying on Sean Hannityâ€™s Fox News show in March, â€œThe current United States ambassador Marie Yovanovitch has bad mouthed the president of the United States to Ukrainian officials and has told them not to listen or worry about Trump policy because heâ€™s going to be impeached.â€ More recently, heâ€™s claimed that George Soros controls a majority of the State Department.
When Solomon wrote that piece alleging that Yovanovitch had given Lutsenko a â€œdo-not-prosecuteâ€ list, he sent a draft first, to three people: Parnas, diGenova, and Toensing.
As a result of investigations into the validity of Solomonâ€™s work, Solomonâ€™s columns were shifted from â€œnewsâ€ to â€œopinionâ€ in 2018. The editor-in-chief of the Hill announced Monday that his work is now being reviewed, â€œupdated,â€ and in some cases, corrected by the paperâ€™s staff. And members of Congress have decried his work as having â€œno veracity whatsoever.â€
But Solomon stands by his stories, and even told Fox News he was considering â€œtargeted legal actionâ€ against those who criticize him.
â€œNotorious for massaging factsâ€
Controversy isnâ€™t exactly new for Solomon, whose previous reporting at larger outlets seems to have focused on â€œblockbuster storiesâ€ that lacked blockbuster facts. Or as the Washington Postâ€™s then-ombudsman Deborah Howell put it, â€œa â€˜gotchaâ€™ without the gotcha.â€
One example: when he wrote a front-page story for the Washington Post in 2007 about the sale of former Democratic vice-presidential candidate John Edwardsâ€™s home. One Washington Post reader said of the story, â€œI read it three times and could not figure out why it was a news story, let alone a front-pager. Whatâ€™s worse was that the placement, the headline and the tone of the story clearly implied that former senator Edwards had done something sleazy.â€
As the Columbia Journalism Review detailed in 2012:
As a reporter for the AP and The Washington Post, he dug up his share of genuine dirt, but he also was notorious for massaging facts to conjure phantom scandals. In 2006, for instance, Solomon and fellow AP writer Sharon Theimer tried to tie now-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to disgraced super-lobbyist Jack Abramoff. The piece hinged on a series of meetings Reid had with Abramoffâ€™s staff to discuss a pending minimum-wage bill and gifts from Abramoff associates who opposed several casino-expansion projects. What it failed to mention is that Reid stuck to his longstanding position on both issuesâ€”meaning that any implications of influence peddling were bogus.
Solomonâ€™s career in journalism saw him at the Associated Press and the Washington Post in the 1990s and early 2000s before he became editor-in-chief of the Washington Times. There, he tasked himself with making the conservative-leaning newspaper the Washington Times more â€œobjective;â€ using the term â€œgayâ€ instead of â€œhomosexual,â€ for example.
In 2008, he told the Washington City Paper of his work at the Washington Times, â€œThe only point I have made with the reporters and editors who write for the news pages is there must be a bright line between opinion and editorializing that rightfully belongs on the op-ed and commentary pages and the fair, balanced, accurate, and precise reporting that must appear in the news sections of the paper.â€
Solomon left the Washington Times in 2009 over financial issues, but returned in 2013 after a time spent as executive editor at the Center for Public Integrity â€” a tenure marked by no small degree of controversy, particularly over Solomonâ€™s efforts to turn the Center into a daily reporting outfit (one that would pay a firm run by Solomon roughly 4 million dollars a year in commission, based on that firmâ€™s projections).
But Solomon had a real talent for boosting traffic and getting attention, which became his focus when he left the Washington Times to go to Circa, a mobile news app that shut down in 2015 before being relaunched that same year by Sinclair Broadcasting Group, a right-leaning company perhaps best known for requiring outlets to run specific pro-Trump promotional segments.
Solomon became Circaâ€™s chief operating officer. It was at Circa where Solomon gained the attention of some of the rightâ€™s biggest names, like Sean Hannity, for reporting alongside Sara Carter on how Michael Flynn was mistreated. Or how the â€œrealâ€ Russia investigation should focus on collusion between Hillary Clinton and the Department of Justice and alleged anti-Trump bias in intelligence services.
That line of argument didnâ€™t gain him much credence among many journalists â€” one conservative writer told me that Solomon was â€œknown to have credibility issuesâ€ that required readers to find a secondary source for any of his scoops. But in 2017, he joined The Hill, a paper that launched in 1994 and describes itself as â€œthe newspaper for and about Congress, breaking stories from Capitol Hill, K Street and the White House.â€ I reached out to the editors at the paper, and will update if and when I hear back.
Your guide to the Donald Trump impeachment saga
Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.
At The Hill, Solomonâ€™s work continued to focus on â€œexclusiveâ€ stories that tended to fall apart under scrutiny, like the Uranium One allegations against Hillary Clinton, or ones that werenâ€™t very exclusive at all, like a piece alleging that an attorney had â€œsought donor cashâ€ for two women who accused Trump of sexual harassment (the attorney in question, Lisa Bloom, had set up a public GoFundMe for one of the alleged victims, which is not unusual).
But it was Solomonâ€™s work on Ukraine â€” work based largely on misinformation given to him by Rudy Giuliani and associates of Giuliani, including his own attorneys â€” that made the biggest impact. Because it was that work that led to a whistleblower complaint focused on allegations that Trump, working with Rudy Giuliani, was â€œpressuring [Ukraine] to investigate one of the Presidentâ€™s main domestic political rivalsâ€ by withholding military aid.
In the White Houseâ€™s partial transcript of a July 25 call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump refers directly to assertions made by John Solomon:
If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, thereâ€™s a lot of talk about Bidenâ€™s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into itâ€¦ It sounds horrible to me.
Despite it now being called into question, John Solomonâ€™s work remains an issue, in large part because it is still taken as fact among some right-leaning pundits and, clearly, the president himself.
On Friday, for example, conservative pundit Glenn Beck alleged that Yovanovitch should be â€œheld for perjuryâ€ when she asserted during sworn testimony that she did not give Lutsenko a â€œdo-not-prosecuteâ€ list. His source?

"Itâ€™s not an exaggeration to say the release of the Frozen 2 soundtrack this past weekend â€” just ahead of Frozen 2â€™s November 22 release date â€” counts as an event. Not since the heyday of Disneyâ€™s â€™90s animated musicals has a film soundtrack had such high expectations to live up to.
Sales of the original Frozen soundtrack blew away all other competitors when it was released in late November 2013 (just a few days before the film itself); it then went on to reign as the No. 1 album of 2014. At the 2014 Oscars, â€œLet It Goâ€ won Best Original Song; the next year, at the 2015 Grammys, the album won Best Compilation Soundtrack, garnering Robert Lopez â€” who wrote all of Frozenâ€™s songs with his wife, Kristen Anderson-Lopez â€” the rare EGOT distinction. (The pair is credited with writing the entire Frozen 2 soundtrack as well.)
Oh, and if you had younger kids, your kids were probably obsessed with it. In 2014, Frozen was everywhere: The film itself grossed a staggering $1.27 billion worldwide, and the filmâ€™s fandom was so eager for more that it drove over $5 billion in retail sales of related Frozen merchandise â€” just in 2014 alone. Not only that, but five years after the filmâ€™s release, the soundtrack was still on the CD sales charts. Thatâ€™s some heavy lifting.
So does the new Frozen 2 soundtrack hold up to all that hype? Yeah, pretty much.
The Frozen 2 soundtrack has just seven new songs â€” plus a reprise, several covers, and a few â€œouttakes.â€ But thereâ€™s a lot to explore.
The Frozen 2 soundtrack boasts the soundtrack versions of its seven totally new songs as well as covers of those songs by artists Kacey Musgraves, Panic! At the Disco, and Weezer. Both Kristen Bell, who voices Princess Anna, and Jonathan Groff, who plays her boyfriend Kristoff, get songs of their own. (Thereâ€™s also a teensy reprise of the Groffsauce classic â€œReindeer(s) are Better Than People.â€) The soundtrack also comes with a few surprises â€” most pleasantly, the revelation that Westworld star Evan Rachel Wood, a new addition to Frozen cast, has a great singing voice. (Fun fact for Broadway buffs: Wood is in a band with guitarist Zane Carney, brother of Hadestownâ€™s Reeve Carney.)
Wood plays Queen Iduna, Elsa and Annaâ€™s late mother. Apparently, her spirit is still alive and kicking, and in the Frozen 2 soundtrackâ€™s opening number, â€œAll Is Found,â€ she gets a beautiful refrain â€” â€œwhere the north wind meets the sea / thereâ€™s a river full of memoryâ€ â€” that recurs throughout other songs and the filmâ€™s score. Musgraves covers this song, and itâ€™s just lovely.
If you already know you love Frozen, youâ€™ll specifically want to seek out the â€œdeluxeâ€ version of the soundtrack, which contains a few more songs listed as â€œouttakes.â€ These songs â€” which were apparently all cut before they made it into the movie â€” include extra solos for Anna and Kristoff, and a gorgeous duet, â€œI Seek the Truth,â€ between songwriter Anderson-Lopez and Patti Murin, who originated the role of Anna in Frozen on Broadway.
The best of the outtakes is â€œGet This Right,â€ a fun, conversational duet between a self-doubting Kristoff and an ever-adventurous Anna, which doubles as a kind of spiritual sequel and answer to Frozenâ€™s â€œLove Is an Open Door.â€
Oh, and hereâ€™s the best part if you like to sing along: The deluxe soundtrack contains with instrumental â€” a.k.a. karaoke â€” versions of all the songs.
Let go of the idea that thereâ€™s a new â€œLet It Goâ€ on the Frozen 2 soundtrack
The centerpiece of the new soundtrack, however, is clearly meant to be â€œInto the Unknown.â€ Itâ€™s the showcase song for Broadway superstar Idina Menzel, who plays, Elsa. But is it the diva power number that fans of â€œLet It Goâ€ have been wanting?
Eh. Iâ€™m leaning toward â€œno.â€
Menzel earned her superstar rep for belting into the stratosphere on songs like Wickedâ€™s â€œDefying Gravityâ€ and Frozenâ€™s â€œLet It Go,â€ and Frozen 2â€™s â€œInto the Unknownâ€ seems to take off the musical gloves and let her fling high notes left and right as Elsa wrestles with restlessness and the call of a new adventure. Sheâ€™s joined in the chorus by Norwegian pop artist Aurora, who voices an eerie incorporeal voice thatâ€™s been summoning Elsa out into the snowy wilderness.
Audio ads for the Frozen 2 soundtrack all feature Menzelâ€™s version of the song, but if that version itself isnâ€™t far enough over the top, the album also sports a cover from Panic! At the Disco, with frontman Brendon Urie repeatedly shrieking the central motif at the very top of his â€” and humanityâ€™s â€” vocal range.
Itâ€™s all very showy and attention-grabbing. But that doesnâ€™t make it the albumâ€™s best song.
As a musical theater nerd, I personally get annoyed whenever lyrics feel repetitive or time-biding â€” that is, when they seem to exist just to fill out a line, or when they say something generically relatable but not character-specific. The Frozen songwriting team usually avoids those traps. (Robert Lopez co-created Avenue Q and The Book of Mormon, while he and Anderson-Lopez also did songs for Disneyâ€™s Coco and the Broadway version of Frozen.) But â€œInto the Unknownâ€ has a few lyrics that fall flat, like â€œsome look for trouble while others donâ€™tâ€ and â€œIgnore your whispers, which I wish would go away.â€ Itâ€™s fine, but compared to the tight, character-building lyrics of â€œLet It Goâ€ â€” â€œa kingdom of isolation and it looks like Iâ€™m the queenâ€ â€” itâ€™s not nearly as satisfying.
The other detail that makes â€œInto the Unknownâ€ less effective for me is that itâ€™s overly packed with drama. If we assess how well the Frozen movies function within the constraints of the musical theater genre â€” where songs must drive plot and/or provide important character revelations â€” then â€œInto the Unknown,â€ like â€œLet It Go,â€ is a â€œwant song.â€ It arrives early in the plot and reveals the heroineâ€™s inner desire for something new, thus providing the motive that will propel the rest of the storyline. But â€œInto the Unknownâ€ gives away too much, too early, both structurally and theatrically. High notes spell out drama, which is why â€œLet It Goâ€ really only has one good one. Too many high notes too often, and the drama becomes less effective.
Think of â€œInto the Unknownâ€ in terms of the function it serves in Frozen 2â€™s overall story. In fact, letâ€™s consider in the context of a Broadway show that the first Frozen film has a lot in common with, Wicked.
In Wicked, the want song â€” the equivalent to Frozen 2â€™s â€œInto the Unknownâ€ â€” is â€œThe Wizard and I.â€ Itâ€™s followed by the big exciting number that closes the first act, â€œDefying Gravity.â€ And then later, thereâ€™s the â€œeleven oâ€™clock numberâ€: the late-in-the-second-act showstopper that marks as a crucial character turning point or climax. In Wicked, thatâ€™s â€œNo Good Deed.â€ Each of these songs has one or two dramatic points, but they work because they arenâ€™t all high-intensity all the time.
Perhaps because an animated movie like Frozen 2 doesnâ€™t have as much room to steadily build drama through multiple songs, it seems to have overloaded on drama in one big early number with â€œInto the Unknown.â€ But that makes the song less exciting for me than it may be for others.
At first, my pick for best song went to Kristoffâ€™s solo number, â€œLost in the Woodsâ€ â€” but upon reflection, I think I was just glad Jonathan Groff finally got a chance to really sing in a Frozen movie. (Heâ€™s probably best known now for Mindhunter, but before that, he found fame originating Broadway roles in Spring Awakening and Hamilton.) After a few listens, â€œLost in the Woodsâ€ starts to feel too generic. Any character could sing these lyrics at any time â€” which is great if you want a song to be a pop hit, but disappointing as a character-builder for Kristoff. It doesnâ€™t help that the out-of-place â€™80s rock instrumentation gives the song an REO Speedwagon-y, Peter Cetera â€Glory of Loveâ€-era vibe. Nothing against the Speedwagon, but it doesnâ€™t quite mesh with Kristoffâ€™s 19th-century Norwegian ice-harvester aesthetic.
Basically, I want good musical scores to give me specific, interesting character development through interesting songs that propel the plot â€” high notes optional. Thatâ€™s why â€œI Seek the Truth,â€ Anna and Elsaâ€™s duet from the outtakes section of the deluxe edition, is probably the Frozen 2 song Iâ€™d take with me to a desert island. Itâ€™s a beautiful duet with insights into both characters, and itâ€™s one of the more complex songs in the score. (In general, the â€œouttakeâ€ songs are collectively the scoreâ€™s strongest group of songs, and I wish the movie had had room for them!)
But if the outtakes donâ€™t count, then after many listens, Iâ€™ve decided that the best song from the Frozen 2 score is â€œShow Yourself,â€ which Elsa sings when she apparently reaches the end of her quest and locates the source of the â€œdisembodied voiceâ€ sheâ€™s been following. Menzel and Wood get a gorgeous duet in this number, with Wood appearing to attach a definable spirit to the incorporeal voice performed by Aurora in the earlier â€œInto the Unknown.â€
â€œShow Yourselfâ€ also has plenty of suspense and excitement, but at this point in the story, that intensity level feels more earned than it does on â€œInto the Unknown,â€ and the duet is thrilling.
Of course, we donâ€™t yet know which song works best in the movie itself. Perhaps, in context, Josh Gadâ€™s songs as Olaf the Snowman will win the day! One thing is a given, however: This weekend, movie theaters will be full of Frozen fans wanting to experience these songs in their full glory. And Iâ€™ll be right there with them, heading into the mostly known experience of Frozen 2."
"In a brilliant white room at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, lies a clear plastic chest filled with bits of the heavens. Inside are meteorites recovered from Antarctic ice and grains of material believed to predate the formation of our solar system. These are treasures, helping us humans understand our place among the stars.
From the chest, geologist Kate Burgess pulls out another treasure: a tiny Teflon vial, double-wrapped in Teflon bags. It contains soil from the moon, collected by the astronauts of Apollo 17 in 1972.

The amount of lunar soil in this vial is tiny. But its scientific value is immense. Brian Resnick/Vox
For a very long time, that soil rested undisturbed on the moon, exposed only to the immense radiation of space. When Burgess peers at the specimen with an electron microscope so powerful it can see down to the scale of atoms, sheâ€™s looking for evidence of how exposure to that radiation changed the soil color. This sounds like small-bore science. But itâ€™s in service of a grand, even beautiful, idea.
Burgess is working to make moon rocks a reference guide to the greater cosmos. Sheâ€™s investigating how much of the soilâ€™s color comes from its composition (what itâ€™s made out of) and how much comes from space weathering. She says figuring that out will help identify the composition of objects â€” like asteroids â€” spotted by telescopes.
In this way, the lunar samples are a link between us and the heavens, helping us see deeper into them and understand what we find. For planetary scientists, research on lunar samples is invaluable. Unlike Earth, the moon hasnâ€™t changed much since it formed. That makes it a time capsule, a Book of Genesis for the geologically inclined.
In other words: Moon rocks rock.
Scientists are still studying the lunar samples from the Apollo moon landings. But there is now renewed interest in sending humans back to the moon for more.
President Trump wants them to get there by 2024. (Weâ€™ll see about that.) And planetary scientists are salivating over the chance to study rocks from the lunar south pole and the side of the moon that never faces Earth. Whether a lunar return is worth the cost, at this point in time, is debatable. But the planetary scientists I spoke with all said, at least, that it would lead to important scientific gains.
Thatâ€™s because the moon rocks we have tell an incredible story about our place in the universe. The more we can collect, the more weâ€™ll learn.
Why the moon is so darned important for planetary science
The moon landings â€” the second of which, Apollo 12, happened 50 years ago this week â€” were about a lot of things: beating the Soviets in the space race, the engineering puzzle of sending humans to the moonâ€™s surface, the challenge for the sake of a challenge. But they were also about geology. Over the course of the six moon landings, astronauts brought back 842 pounds of lunar rocks, pebbles, and soil.
Itâ€™s not an exaggeration to say those rocks changed our understanding of our solar system and rewrote its history. â€œBefore Apollo, we really did not know how the moon formed,â€ says Juliane Gross, a planetary scientist at Rutgers University.
To study geology is to study history. But Earth is constantly erasing its old geologic record.
â€œThe Earth is a gigantic recycling machine,â€ Gross says. â€œWe have wind, we have rain, we have ice and weather, and so all the rocks weather away.â€ The crust of our planet is dynamic; our continents float, move, and change. Through the ages, rocks are recycled, remelted, and reformed as continents smash into one another.
The moon, on the other hand, doesnâ€™t erase its history. Aside from asteroid impacts, Gross says, â€œthe moon hasnâ€™t changed much since its formation.â€ That makes it a time capsule, a ledger for the history of our solar system.
In a moon rock, â€œyou have this tiny treasure trove in your hands,â€ Gross says. Growing up, she had a dream of becoming an astronaut, which was eventually quashed by her susceptibility to motion sickness. Working with these rocks, she says, â€œthatâ€™s as close as I can get to be[ing] an astronaut.â€ But instead of exploring space, she and her colleagues are exploring time.
â€œThe [lunar] crust is basically an archive,â€ Gross says. â€œAnd we need to learn how to interpret and how to read that archive.â€ One of its most important lessons is about how the Earth and moon were formed in the first place.
Moon rocks tell the story of creation
The picture below shows a 4-pound moon rock recovered in 1972 from Apollo 16. Itâ€™s mostly made of plagioclase, a rock formed out of molten magma. Rocks like this one make up most of the moonâ€™s crust. And that tells scientists the moon had a very violent beginning.
NASA
Around 4.5 billion years ago, when the solar system was still in its infancy, it was a much more chaotic place.
Not long before that (cosmically speaking), the sun had burst into being, fusing together hydrogen atoms from an immense ball of gas, setting alight a fire that burns to this day. And that young star was still surrounded by bits of debris clumping together, smashing into one another, forming the planets.
Itâ€™s believed that around this time, the Earth (or more like an Earth predecessor) was hit by another planet maybe the size of Mars.
The resulting cataclysm fused the two worlds together, forming our Earth. The power of the collision ejected material from both bodies, and that material melted together to form our moon. The early moon was covered in an ocean of magma, which settled and cooled into the form we know today.
Javier Zarracina/Vox
In this way, the Earth and the moon were a (fraternal) twin birth.
But wait, how do we suspect all this from a boring old white rock?
The answer is kind of simple. Plagioclase is not very dense; itâ€™s the type of mineral youâ€™d expect to arise on the surface of a magma ocean as it cools. When the moon was formed, the plagioclase â€œactually rose to the surface of the moon and started creating a crust,â€ says Darby Dyar, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute who has been studying lunar samples for decades.
Javier Zarracina/Vox
Scientists are still debating the details of this hypothesis. But it seems reasonable because the Earth and moon are made out of similar base materials (suggesting they were created from the same source material) and because that material was molten at the time they formed (due to the great power of the impact).
But thatâ€™s just the beginning of the story moon rocks tell.
What moon craters can tell us about the history of the solar system
A huge part of the â€œarchiveâ€ of the lunar crust is its craters. And scientists have been able to use the Apollo samples to accurately date those craters.
The moon has changed far less than the Earth, but that doesnâ€™t mean it hasnâ€™t changed at all. Asteroids have hit it over and over again, leading to the pockmarked surface we can see in the night sky. Those craters tell the story of what happened in the solar system after the Earth and the moon were formed.
By age-dating the moonâ€™s craters, we can age-date craters elsewhere. The bigger the craters, the longer ago they were made (because bigger chunks of debris were more common farther back in time). â€œAnd now ... we have a beautiful impact history of the solar system,â€ Dyar says. There are craters on other planets, like Mercury, for example. We now know the age of Mercuryâ€™s craters â€œbecause we have a reference set of information from the moon.â€
Learning how old the moonâ€™s craters are then led to another stunning hypothesis: that the outermost planets â€” Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune â€” have changed their orbits over their lifetimes.
The craters show that around 600 million years after the planets formed, there was a period of heavy bombardment, meaning that the moon got smacked with a lot of asteroids. This was weird. The frantic pace of asteroid collisions ought to have settled down by then.
So what explains the impacts during this time? One possible idea is that if those big gas giant planets moved closer to the sun and then farther away, â€œthey would have disturbed asteroids and they would have flung the asteroids around,â€ creating the collisions, Gross says.
Scientists still arenâ€™t sure if this is the case. But without moon rocks, they might not have considered the case at all.
Why scientists want more lunar samples
Weâ€™ve learned a ton from less than a ton of moon rocks. But these planetary geologists are hungry for more. One reason is that all the Apollo missions landed near the moonâ€™s equator.
Would the scientists like to study samples from other areas? â€œOh, hell yeah,â€ Gross says. â€œAbsolutely.â€
â€œTo try to interpret something about the history of the moon from a few hundred kilograms of rocks is very frustrating,â€ Dyar says, adding that we donâ€™t have any samples from the far side of the moon at all. â€œWe donâ€™t know what other interesting science weâ€™re gonna find.â€
The White House is currently pushing NASA to send humans to the moon again by 2024. For now, the plan is for those astronauts to visit the lunar south pole at a crater called the South Poleâ€“Aitken basin â€” one of the biggest, deepest, and therefore oldest of the moonâ€™s craters. Itâ€™s possible the impact that created the basin was so powerful that it exposed the mantle, or interior, of the moon.
Scientists canâ€™t directly study the Earthâ€™s mantle. The moonâ€™s would be the next best thing. â€œIf we can get some of that back, that would be absolutely spectacular,â€ Gross says. It could help us understand why the Earth has such active geology and the moon does not.
Burgess hopes that if humans get to the moon, they can bring home some samples from areas that have not been exposed to as much space radiation so she can see a more pristine example of an unweathered space rock. Again, thatâ€™s in service of understanding what other objects â€” ones we donâ€™t have pieces of â€” are made out of.
And that knowledge could have a lot of practical implications. For instance, in the future, if humans want to start mining asteroids for metals and minerals, it will be enormously helpful to know the exact geologic makeup of a particular asteroid before we arrive.
There are a lot of reasons to return humans to the moon and establish a more permanent presence there. The moon would be a good laboratory to teach astronauts how to better survive long, lonely missions in deep space. It would be a good launching ground for missions to Mars, or beyond. And it would potentially be a spot to mine for natural resources.
One of Burgessâ€™s favorite discoveries is bits of helium she found stuck into teeny pits on the lunar sample dirt. The helium â€œis some of the sun trapped in the moon,â€ she says. The sun blasts off gases and particles in every direction, and our moon soaked up some of them like a sponge. The finding is as poetic as it is practical: Helium is an increasingly scarce resource on Earth. Perhaps we can learn to harvest it from the moon.
Moon rocks represent what happens when human curiosity is allowed to flourish
To study the moon is to study the Earth and wonder: How special is our world?
â€œI always think that the most important question for human beings to answer is the issue of, are we alone?â€ Dyar says. â€œIs Earth unique?â€ And in a small way, studying a pile of moon rocks helps us answer that question.
Figuring out how our solar system formed, how our planet formed, helps us understand how rare we are and how special a place this truly is. What if a Mars-sized body never collided with an Earth-sized one? Was that cataclysm somehow necessary for the chain of events that led to life, to you and me, to pizza?
If the moon never existed, Earth would be very different (there wouldnâ€™t be ocean tides, for example). But we would be different too. And weâ€™d possibly be less curious about our place in the universe.
Astronauts on Apollo 17, the last moon landing, look out on moon dust and rock. What secrets are still hidden in this rubble? NASA
Without the moon, â€œI think humanity would have probably never looked up into the sky [and thought], â€˜Oh, this object is fairly close, letâ€™s try and get there,â€™â€ Gross says. â€œSo we would never have had the curiosity to develop our technology and tools to leave our own planet.â€
For so many reasons, the moon is our first stepping stone to the greater reaches of space and the mysteries that lie within. I donâ€™t know if we need to get more moon rocks by the year 2024 specifically. But sometime, someday, we ought to go back.

"On Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts handed President Trump a small victory in what could be the most important presidential immunity case since the Nixon administration.
Trump v. Mazars USA involves Trumpâ€™s effort to escape a House subpoena seeking many of his financial documents. Roberts temporarily halted enforcement of that subpoena to give the Supreme Court more time to consider whether to grant Trump a lengthier stay or lower court decisions saying the subpoena may be enforced. (As the â€œcircuit justiceâ€ overseeing cases that arise from a DC federal appeals court, Roberts has the power to issue a brief stay while the Court is considering whether to hand down a much longer one).
Existing law is very bad for Trump in this case. Itâ€™s very clear under decades of Supreme Court precedents that the House can enforce this subpoena. So the stakes in Mazars are high. If Trump does prevail before the justices, that decision could inaugurate a new era of presidential immunity from oversight.
Last May, a federal judge held that the House Oversight Committee may enforce a subpoena seeking many of Trumpâ€™s financial documents â€” including, most likely, his tax forms â€” from Trumpâ€™s accounting firm, Mazars USA. The committee says it seeks these documents as part of an inquiry into whether stricter financial disclosure laws are needed, although it is likely (as Trumpâ€™s lawyers suggest in their brief) that the committee also wants the documents because they will offer a window into corrupt dealings by the president.
Trump has fought hard to convince appeals courts that the House cannot obtain these documents â€” or, at least, that it cannot obtain them right now â€” and the subpoena remains unenforced.
That could change soon, however, assuming that the Supreme Court decides to apply the same rules to this subpoena that it applied to politically-charged subpoenas in the past. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon (1974), the case that required President Richard Nixon to turn over incriminating tape recordings that ended his presidency, â€œneither the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.â€
But itâ€™s far from clear that this Supreme Court agrees with the ruling in Nixon â€” or, at least, that this Courtâ€™s Republican majority believes that cases like Nixon should be applied to President Trump.
Trumpâ€™s latest addition to the Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, suggested in 1999 that Nixon was â€œwrongly decidedâ€ (though he later praised Nixon during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, saying that he viewed it as a sign of judicial independence). Three lower court judges, all Republicans, also voted in Trumpâ€™s favor in various lower court proceedings.
So thereâ€™s a real chance that Trump could prevail in the Republican-controlled Supreme Court â€” and if he does prevail, that could be a legal earthquake. The Supreme Courtâ€™s precedents point in one direction: Congress has a broad oversight power, and presidents are not above the law. Mazars could change all of that.
Mazars, moreover, is just one example of Trump seeking extraordinary legal immunity. In a closely related case, Trump v. Vance, where a New York prosecutor seeks Trumpâ€™s financial documents, Trumpâ€™s lawyer argued that a sitting president is immune from criminal investigation if the president shoots someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue. (Trumpâ€™s lawyers also asked the Supreme Court to hear the Vance case, but itâ€™s unlikely that the Court will weigh in on that request before it decides whether to grant a stay in Mazars.)
If the Supreme Court buys Trumpâ€™s arguments, in other words, Trump could potentially gain the kind of legal immunity more commonly associated with despots than with elected officials. At the very least, decisions in Trumpâ€™s favor would signal that the Court is inclined to give Trump far more favorable treatment than it gave to past presidents.
Trumpâ€™s legal arguments are exceedingly weak
Under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, Congressâ€™s power to conduct oversight and issue subpoenas is quite broad. As the Court explained in Eastland v. United States Servicemenâ€™s Fund (1975), Congressâ€™s investigatory power extends broadly to subpoenas â€œintended to gather information about a subject on which legislation may be had.â€
Both the trial court and the intermediate appeals court ruled that the Mazars subpoena was properly issued under this broad power because the House is considering legislation that would impose stronger financial disclosure requirements on the president, and the records sought by the House Oversight Committee could inform whether such legislation is necessary.
In response, Trumpâ€™s lawyers argue that the real purpose of this subpoena isnâ€™t to inform the legislative process at all. Itâ€™s to determine whether Trump â€œbroke the law.â€ Much of their argument echoes a dissenting opinion by Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, who claims that â€œthe Constitution provides only one way for Congress to investigate illegal conduct by the President,â€ and thatâ€™s an impeachment inquiry.
This is the kind of distinction that only the most persnickety lawyer could love. While there was no formal impeachment investigation going on when the Mazars subpoena was initially issued, there is one now. So whatâ€™s the point of an argument about whether the House was engaged in a legitimate legislative process if it is free to get these documents as part of an impeachment inquiry?
The most likely answer to this question, however, is delay. If the Supreme Court buys Raoâ€™s argument, that could force the House to reissue the subpoena as part of its impeachment inquiry, and then wait months or even years while the case winds its way through the courts again. By that point, the case could be moot.
Alternatively, Trumpâ€™s lawyers also argue that the subpoena is invalid because the â€œfull Houseâ€ did not vote to specifically give the House Oversight Committee the power to issue this particular subpoena. Again, this is the kind of argument that serves only to delay. If the Supreme Court buys this argument, the House can just hold such a vote â€” but that could also reset the litigation clock and allow Trump to delay the case into oblivion.
Beyond these two legal arguments, Trumpâ€™s lawyers also offer a political argument why the Court should rule in Trumpâ€™s favor. The justices should favor Trump in order to fight â€œthe temptation to dig up dirt on political rivals.â€ Mazars, they claim, is â€œa case of firsts.â€ It is the â€œfirst time Congress has subpoenaed the personal records of a President that predate his time in officeâ€ and â€œthe first time Congress has issued a subpoena, under its legislative powers, to investigate the President for illegal conduct.â€
That may very well be true, but itâ€™s far from clear why any of these claims that Mazars is unprecedented should matter legally. The Supreme Court held in Clinton v. Jones (1997) that a sitting president may be sued â€œbased on actions allegedly taken before his term began.â€ And there was never a serious legal argument that the Senate Watergate hearings were unconstitutional. Mazars is distinct from past presidential investigations in superficial ways, but it is unclear why any of those distinctions have legal significance.
Indeed, to the extent that Mazars is distinguishable from prior investigations into past presidents, those distinctions cut against Trump. As the Court explained in Jones, â€œWe have never suggested that the President, or any other official, has an immunity that extends beyond the scope of any action taken in an official capacity.â€ The fact that the House seeks records unrelated to Trumpâ€™s presidency cuts against Trump.
So current law is very clear that Congress may issue these subpoenas. The open question is whether the current Supreme Court believes that this law should apply to President Trump.
The Supreme Court could hand Trump a big victory without ever ruling on the merits of this case
The immediate question facing the Supreme Court is whether to stay the lower appeals courtâ€™s decision against Trump. On Friday, Trumpâ€™s lawyers formally sought such a stay from the Supreme Court. Then, on Monday, Chief Justice Roberts temporarily halted enforcement of the subpoena while he and his colleagues consider whether to grant a longer stay. He also ordered the House to respond to Trumpâ€™s request for a stay by Thursday afternoon.
That means we will likely find out next week if the Supreme Court will grant a lengthy stay. If the Court does grant it, that would prevent the House Oversight Committee from enforcing its subpoena until after the Supreme Court decides whether to hear the case on the merits â€” and most likely until after the Court hands down a full decision on the merits.
Should the Court decide to hear the case, itâ€™s possible that a decision could come as soon as next June. Itâ€™s also possible that the case could be pushed to next term â€” which would almost certainly delay final resolution of the case until after the election.
Indeed, if the Court grants a stay and then sits on its hands, we may never get a Supreme Court decision telling us if the Mazars subpoena can be enforced. If Trump wins the 2020 election, gerrymandering and Trumpâ€™s coattails are likely to sweep Republicans into power in the House â€” and then House Republicans can simply cancel the subpoena themselves.
Should the Court grant the stay, moreover, the majority is unlikely to publish an opinion explaining why they did so. Stay requests are typically disposed of in brief orders, although those orders sometimes are accompanied by dissenting opinions.
Trumpâ€™s request for a stay, in other words, is an example of what University of Chicago law professor William Baude refers to as the Supreme Courtâ€™s â€œshadow docketâ€ â€” a potentially very consequential decision that is decided without opinion, explanation, or any impact on the Courtâ€™s prior precedents.
If the Courtâ€™s Republican majority wants to rule in favor of Trump, but save itself from the awkward task of explaining why precedents like Nixon shouldnâ€™t control this case, they could potentially hand Trump a quiet, unexplained victory simply by granting the stay and then delaying resolution of the case until the next term."
"Chick-fil-A is arguably best known for three things: its juicy chicken sandwiches, its employeesâ€™ perpetually chipper attitudes, and its long history of donating to charities with anti-LGBTQ stances.
But one of those things seems to be changing next year. The fast-food chain is changing its charitable giving approach in 2020 â€” and says, in an oblique way, that it will no longer donate to such organizations.
The Chick-fil-A Foundation will instead take â€œa more focused giving approach,â€ Chick-fil-A announced in a Monday press release. The foundation has set aside $9 million for 2020 that will be split between three initiatives: promoting youth education, combating youth homelessness, and fighting hunger. Those funds will be distributed to Junior Achievement USA, Covenant House International, and local food banks in cities where the chain opens new locations.
The release didnâ€™t outright say the biggest change to Chick-fil-Aâ€™s philanthropic giving plan: In 2020, the chain wonâ€™t give any money to charities that take anti-LGBTQ stances. In an interview with real estate publication Bisnow, however, Chick-fil-Aâ€™s president and CEO Tim Tassopoulos made it clear that the companyâ€™s new donation strategy is at least partly related to the constant backlash Chick-fil-A has faced over its donations.
â€œThereâ€™s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are,â€ Tassopoulos told Bisnow. â€œThere are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.â€
Notably, Chick-fil-A never explicitly said it would permanently stop donating to anti-gay groups or organizations that discriminate against LGBTQ people â€” it just said it was changing its philanthropic giving model. Chick-fil-A didnâ€™t respond to The Goodsâ€™ request for comment, but a company spokesperson did tell VICE that it wouldnâ€™t rule out giving to religious groups in the future.
â€œNo organization will be excluded from future considerationâ€“faith-based or non-faith-based,â€ Chick-fil-A President and COO Tim Tassopoulos said in a statement to VICE.
Chick-fil-Aâ€™s controversial donations donâ€™t seem to have made a dent in its profits â€” as of late 2018, it was on track to be the third-largest fast-food chain in the United States â€” though itâ€™s hard to know for sure since the company is still privately held. Still, Tassopoulosâ€™s comments suggest that the companyâ€™s reputation has suffered even if its bottom line hasnâ€™t.
LGBTQ groups are â€œcautiously optimisticâ€ about the change
LGBTQ rights groups like GLAAD say Mondayâ€™s news is a step in the right direction for Chick-fil-A, though they warn the chain is still far from inclusive.
â€œChick-fil-A investors, employees, and customers can greet todayâ€™s announcement with cautious optimism, but should remember that similar press statements were previously proven to be empty,â€ Drew Anderson, director of campaigns and rapid response for GLAAD, told The Goods in an emailed statement. â€œIn addition to refraining from financially supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations, Chick-Fil-A still lacks policies to ensure safe workplaces for LGBTQ employees and should unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents.â€
As Andersonâ€™s statement suggests, Chick-fil-A has promised to cut ties with anti-LGBTQ charities before. In 2012, the Chicago-based Civil Rights Agenda issued a statement claiming that Chick-fil-A had promised to â€œno longer give to anti-gay organizations, such as Focus on the Family and the National Organization for marriage.â€
Chick-fil-A declined to comment on the matter at the time, instead issuing a boilerplate statement to BuzzFeed News:
â€œWe have no agenda, policy or position against anyone. We have a 65-year history of providing hospitality for all people and, as a dedicated family business, serving and valuing everyone regardless of their beliefs or opinions. The genuine, historical intent of our WinShape Foundation and corporate giving has been to support youth, family and educational programs.â€
But the companyâ€™s donations to anti-LGBTQ groups continued. As ThinkProgress reported in 2017, Chick-fil-A continued to bankroll anti-gay groups like the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Salvation Army, and the Paul Anderson Youth Home through its foundation. Recent tax filings show that Chick-fil-Aâ€™s foundation donated $115,000 to the Salvation Army and $1.65 million to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes in 2018, though a company spokesperson told Bisnow that those donations were the result of multi-year commitments to each organization.
This time around, though, Chick-fil-A announced the change to its philanthropic plan itself instead of letting the news trickle out through a third party. But it didnâ€™t quite promise to end all donations to anti-LGBTQ groups. Instead, the Chick-fil-A Foundation will begin doling out donations through annual grants, Tassopoulos told Bisnow, and it will reevaluate the charities it donates to each year.
Chick-fil-Aâ€™s business model is largely rooted in its ownerâ€™s religious beliefs
S. Truett Cathy, a devout Baptist, opened the first Chick-fil-A in Atlanta in 1967, and the chain has remained in his familyâ€™s hands ever since. Today there are more than 2,300 locations across the country â€” all of which are closed on Sundays. (â€œHaving worked seven days a week in restaurants open 24 hours,â€ Chick-fil-Aâ€™s website reads, â€œTruett saw the importance of closing on Sundays so that he and his employees could set aside one day to rest and worship if they choose â€” a practice we uphold today.â€ A previous iteration of the website reportedly claimed the restaurant was closed on Sundays as a â€œtestament to [Cathyâ€™s] faith in God.â€)
â€œIt was not an issue in 1946 when we opened up our first restaurant,â€ Dan Cathy, Truettâ€™s son and the chainâ€™s current CEO, said in a 2012 interview with the Baptist Press. â€œWhile developers had no identity whatsoever with our corporate purpose to â€˜glorify God and be a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us and have a positive influence on all that come in contact with Chick-fil-A,â€™ they did identify with the rent checks that we wrote to the mall, based on our sales.â€

Boycotts havenâ€™t stopped the growth of Chick-fil-A
That 2012 interview, in which Cathy was quoted as saying that he believes in the â€œbiblical definition of the family unitâ€ â€” i.e., that marriage should only be between a man and a woman â€” was the catalyst for a major national controversy. Cathy later tried to clarify his point in a radio interview: â€œAs it relates to society in general,â€ he said, â€œI think we are inviting Godâ€™s judgement on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, â€˜We know better than you do as to what constitutes marriage.â€™â€
The backlash to Cathyâ€™s comments was swift. First a New York woman named Carly McGehee planned an LGBTQ kiss-in at Chick-fil-A restaurants across the country. It was scheduled for August 3, 2012. Then came the backlash to the backlash: Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee responded to McGeheeâ€™s plan with a â€œChick-fil-A Appreciation Dayâ€ scheduled for August 1. Thousands of people across the country bought chicken sandwiches in support of the Cathys and their mission, and Dan Cathy himself made an appearance at a Chick-fil-A location in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to thank customers for showing up.
But the 2012 incident wasnâ€™t the first time the Cathys were accused of homophobia. A year earlier, a Pennsylvania Chick-fil-Aâ€™s decision to donate food to a marriage seminar conducted by the Pennsylvania Family Institute, a group known for its anti-gay advocacy, prompted a nationwide boycott of the chain. Cathy issued a video statement in response to the boycott, in which he claimed the company â€œserves all peopleâ€ and that, while he personally believes in the â€œbiblical definition of marriage,â€ his company doesnâ€™t have an â€œanti-gay agenda.â€ And back in 2002, a former employee of a Houston Chick-fil-A sued the chain for discrimination. The employee, who was Muslim, alleged he had been fired because he refused to pray to Jesus with other employees. The suit was settled out of court.
These controversies also shined a light on the fact that the Cathys regularly made donations to charities known for discriminating against LGBTQ people.
In 2011, the same year a Pennsylvania Chick-fil-A franchise donated food to a local anti-gay organization, the LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Matters obtained tax records which revealed that the Cathy family had donated more than $1.9 million to anti-gay groups in 2010 through the WinShape Foundation, the Cathy familyâ€™s charitable giving organization founded by Truett Cathy in 1984. Those donations included a $1.1 million gift to the Marriage & Family Foundation, a group that promoted so-called traditional marriage and opposed both gay marriage and divorce; $480,000 to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, an athletic organization that requires applicants to agree to a â€œsexual purity statementâ€ that condemns LGBTQ people for living â€œimpure lifestyle[s]â€; and $1,000 to Exodus International, a group that promotes anti-gay conversion therapy.
For Chick-fil-Aâ€™s opponents, the problem was bigger than Cathyâ€™s anti-gay comments, it was that he was apparently putting his money where his mouth was, and he had a lot of money to go around.
Petitions and boycotts didnâ€™t hurt Chick-fil-A â€” the chain continued expanding across the country despite peopleâ€™s opposition to the Cathysâ€™ views on marriage â€” but they did potentially contribute to making the Cathys somewhat less vocal about their political beliefs.
In a 2014 interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Cathy admitted he regretted getting involved in the gay marriage debate. Cathy didnâ€™t claim to have regretted what he said, just that he said it. â€œI think the time of truths and principles are captured and codified in Godâ€™s word and Iâ€™m just personally committed to that,â€ he said at the time. â€œI know others feel very different from that and I respect their opinion and I hope that they would be respectful of mine. ... I think thatâ€™s a political debate thatâ€™s going to rage on. And the wiser thing for us to do is to stay focused on customer service.â€
Chick-fil-Aâ€™s controversies somehow havenâ€™t been bad for business, but they are bad PR
Though Chick-fil-A never managed to fully shed its reputation as a homophobic purveyor of delicious chicken sandwiches, it continued to expand its national presence, especially above the Mason-Dixon line. New York Cityâ€™s first Chick-fil-A, a 5,000-square-foot behemoth in Midtown, opened in 2015. (It was met with resistance by locals but opened anyway.) Three years later, Chick-fil-A added another New York City location, a five-story, 12,000-square-foot restaurant that, according to ABC News, is â€œnearly twice the size of any existing Chick-fil-A.â€ (This location, like many other Chick-fil-As across the country, is an independently owned franchise. It is not open on Sundays.)

By the end of 2018, Chick-fil-A was slated to overtake Subway and become the third-largest fast-food restaurant in the country after McDonaldâ€™s and Starbucks, according to a report by Kalinowski Equity Research. Itâ€™s reportedly the most profitable fast-food chain in the country on a per-location basis, and has been the number one fast-food restaurant on the American Customer Satisfaction Index for three years in a row.
In a 2017 interview with Morning Consult, Thomas Ordahl, chief strategy officer of the brand consulting firm Landor, succinctly explained how Chick-fil-A has been able to weather these constant controversies. â€œWhatâ€™s interesting about the paradox of Chick-fil-A is that, in many ways, itâ€™s probably one of the most socially advanced companies in terms of treatment of employees and its role in the community,â€ Ordahl said, â€œand yet its founder has a position that is quite dissonant with most people in the U.S.â€
As Rachel Sugar previously wrote for The Goods, part of Chick-fil-Aâ€™s popularity is due to a pretty simple fact: people eat there because they like the food, even if they donâ€™t like what the Cathys stand for.
The Cathysâ€™ â€œdissonant view,â€ as one brand consultant called it, may have finally hurt Chick-fil-Aâ€™s bottom line â€” especially now that a popular, non-homophobic alternative to Chick-fil-Aâ€™s sandwiches has emerged. Earlier this year, Popeyeâ€™s temporarily began selling chicken sandwiches at its locations across the country. The sandwiches were so popular that the chain declared a national shortage in August.
Popeyeâ€™s sandwiches are now back for good, and a promotional video announcing their return even made fun of Chick-fil-Aâ€™s long standing policy of keeping all its locations closed on Sundays.
The popularity of Popeyeâ€™s sandwiches means Chick-fil-A no longer has a virtual monopoly of the chicken sandwich market, but increased competition doesnâ€™t entirely explain why the company is finally changing its philanthropic giving plan. Itâ€™s also possible that the Cathysâ€™ politics are finally hindering the companyâ€™s expansion.
In July, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a controversial piece of legislation that supporters dubbed the â€œSave Chick-fil-Aâ€ bill. The law, introduced in response to the San Antonio City Councilâ€™s decision to remove a proposed Chick-fil-A location from its airport concession agreement, forbids government entities from taking â€œadverse actionsâ€ against businesses because of their religious beliefs or actions.
San Antonio may not have fully succeeded in kicking Chick-fil-A out of its airport, but the cityâ€™s decision seems to have sparked a new wave of backlash to Chick-fil-A. In September, the airport concession company Delaware North kicked Chick-fil-A and a few other big chains out of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport in favor of local restaurants.
Across the pond, protesters managed to get the landlord of a Chick-fil-A location in Reading, England to opt out of renewing the chainâ€™s lease just 8 days after it had opened. (A Chick-fil-A spokesperson told VICE that the lease was never supposed to last longer than six months.)
Martin Cooper, the head of Reading Pride, told a local publication that the Cathysâ€™ charitable giving influenced the groupâ€™s opposition to the restaurant.
â€œWeâ€™re here to inform the community in Reading what has been allowed to set up in our town. Itâ€™s a business based on anti-LGBT beliefs,â€ Cooper said. â€œIf it was just beliefs, we probably wouldnâ€™t be here protesting. Itâ€™s about the active engagement and where their profits are going.â€

"For
a long time now, the cross-generational dialogue between baby boomers and millennials has been built atop several recurring themes. Boomers â€” the generation born roughly between 1946 and 1965 â€” scoff that millennials expect â€œparticipation trophiesâ€ for doing the bare minimum. Millennials say boomers are â€œout of touch.â€ Millennials (born roughly between 1980 and 1996) are â€œkillingâ€ once-stable industries like cereal by saving money, spending less, and â€œeating avocados.â€ Boomers have â€œmortgaged the futureâ€ in exchange for hoarding wealth while also voting to end necessary social programs. Millennials would rather complain about student debt than buckle down, work hard, and â€œget a job.â€
If anything, teens have been subjected to even harsher rhetorical maligning. Members of Generation Z, born roughly between 1996 and 2015, are portrayed as addicted to their phones, â€œintolerantâ€ of their elders, and stuck in a â€œdifferent worldâ€ thanks to the internet.
With all this repetitive back-and-forth â€” seriously, there are bingo cards â€” itâ€™s no wonder the most polarizing meme of the year is a two-word dismissal of the whole debate. â€œOK boomer,â€ which floated into the internet mainstream and rapidly gained traction this fall, is an attempt by millennials and Gen Z to both encapsulate this circular argument and reject it entirely.
OK boomer is meant to be cutting and dismissive. It suggests that the conversation around the anxieties and concerns of younger generations has become so exhausting and unproductive that the younger generations are collectively over it. OK boomer implies that the older generation misunderstands millennial and Gen Z culture and politics so fundamentally that years of condescension and misrepresentation have led to this pointedly terse rebuttal and rejection. Rather than endlessly defend decisions stemming from deep economic strife, to save money instead of investing in stocks and retirement funds, to buy avocados instead of cereal â€” teens and younger adults are simply through.
The conversation isnâ€™t through with them, however, not least because the rise of OK boomer has provoked concurrent backlash from baby boomers, many of whom have misread the meme, and feel it is motivated mainly by ageism. But that misreading also feeds the meme â€” because baby boomers failing to understand the point of OK boomer is, well, the point of OK boomer.
Donâ€™t get it twisted. Itâ€™s important to understand that what really lies behind the meme is increasing economic, environmental, and social anxiety, and the feeling that baby boomers are leaving younger generations to clean up their mess.
OK boomer is an instantly relatable cry of frustration to many people
The earliest mentions of OK boomer can be traced as far back as 2015 on 4chan, where the phrase was used as an insult by the forumâ€™s anonymous users, aimed at other anons who seemed out of touch. But the phrase really took off this year on TikTok, as a rebuttal to angry rants by baby boomers about kids these days. A song by Peter Kuli & Jedwill known as â€œOK BOOMER!â€ â€” the verses define boomers as racist, fascist Trump supporters with bad hair â€” became a popular song choice for TikTok sing-along videos this fall. Teens on the platform used the songâ€™s intro and chorus as a rebuttal to annoying run-ins theyâ€™d had with seniors policing or judging their behavior:
Sometimes, the complaints teens are referencing in these videos are typical generational conflicts. But more often, theyâ€™re politicized, with teens reacting to adults who are judging things like their gender expression, their financial choices, their approach to job-hunting, or their leisure activities. The broader background to all of this resentment is the perceived irony that while boomers nitpick and judge younger generations for their specific choices, itâ€™s the boomersâ€™ own choices that created the bleak socioeconomic landscape that millennials and Gen Z currently face.
â€œEverybody in Gen Z is affected by the choices of the boomers, that they made and are still making,â€ teen entrepreneur Nina Kasman told the New York Times in October. â€œThose choices are hurting us and our future. Everyone in my generation can relate to that experience and weâ€™re all really frustrated by it.â€
â€œ[T]he two words feel downright poetic after years of hearing my generation blamed for â€˜killingâ€™ everything from restaurant chains to department stores to relationships,â€ wrote Gristâ€™s Miyo McGinn in early November, â€œeven as so many of the challenges people my age face â€” student loan debt, general economic instability, and, of course, a rapidly warming planet â€” are the result of short-sighted decisions made by earlier generations.â€
This broader socioeconomic aspect seems to have gotten lost as the meme spread throughout the mainstream, however. Many people became aware of OK boomer through the October New York Times article, which focused on teens who had taken the meme offline and were turning it into merchandise and fashion statements. Almost immediately, people rushed to sell OK boomer merchandise and attempted to trademark the phrase, and brands began to use it on social media â€” completely missing the inherent critique of capitalism that the meme enfolds, which led to more eyerolling.
But millennials who mocked the instant trendiness of OK boomer were drowned out by the memeâ€™s intended targets: boomers. Some began claiming that â€œboomerâ€ was an ageist slur equivalent to â€œthe n-word,â€ while others merely discouraged the use of â€œboomerâ€ in the workplace. Media outlets opined that the meme was â€œdividing generations.â€ Gen Xers offered the â€œboth sidesâ€ take. In the Washington Post, history professor Holly Scott reminded everyone that boomers were once activists too.
This response helped further cement the meme as a dismissive retort to boomer condescension â€” and as it spread, its political aspects became more pointed. On November 4, 25-year-old New Zealand politician ChloÃ« Swarbrick used the phrase as a rebuttal to one of her older colleagues in Parliament after the man heckled her during a speech about climate change. The moment occurred just as she was discussing the urgency her generation feels to prioritize and deal seriously with the problem, and explaining her frustration that previous cycles of lawmakers have failed to do so.
Swarbrick was castigated for bringing the meme into a political forum â€” but as she herself made clear in a subsequent essay for the Guardian, the meme represents a wealth of generational political concerns: â€œMy â€˜OK boomerâ€™ comment in parliament was off-the-cuff, albeit symbolic of the collective exhaustion of multiple generations set to inherit ever-amplifying problems in an ever-diminishing window of time,â€ she wrote.
The point of Swarbrickâ€™s climate change speech was that younger generations feel they can no longer rely on older generations to help solve major and daunting environmental and economic issues. And many baby boomers seem to be making her point for her by misunderstanding what OK boomer is about.
What many boomers think OK boomer is about: ageism and entitlement
â€œAs a baby boomer myself, I have mixed feelings about the latest linguistic weapon of generational warfare being deployed against us,â€ Bloombergâ€™s Tyler Cowen recently wrote in response to the meme. Cowen touched on what he saw as the memeâ€™s ageism and attempted to reframe it as an ironic compliment to boomers, asserting that boomers are still the boss. â€œThe phrase â€˜OK boomerâ€™ is itself an implicit and indeed somewhat passive admission as to who is really in charge,â€ he decided.
Cowenâ€™s column was a strange echo of an August essay by former Deadspin editor Megan Greenwell. As she was exiting Deadspin, she wrote about the tone-deaf and poorly considered changes the siteâ€™s new parent company, G/O Media, had brought to the newsroom. Beyond discussing specific issues at Deadspin, Greenwellâ€™s essay was a larger swipe at the hubris of tech companies and corporate moguls for assuming that they, not the journalists whose media outlets they were ruining, were â€œthe adults in the room.â€ This attitude prompted an eventual wholesale rejection by Deadspinâ€™s editorial staff, as they chose to resign en masse rather than submit to the whims of the bosses they felt were out of touch.

In a very real sense, that same tension between condescending, older authority figures and younger ones who reject them is at work in the OK boomer meme. Boomers like Cowen are simultaneously anxious about the memeâ€™s ageist implications, and eager to assert their wisdom over younger generations. In response to this line of thinking, the Twitter hashtag #boomeradvice recently went viral â€” but instead of praising boomersâ€™ knowhow, the point of the tag was to mock the most out-of-touch advice, often about work, job-seeking, and finance, that boomers had given millennials and teens.
Whatâ€™s largely missing from the â€œelders know bestâ€ logic is any acknowledgment that itâ€™s part of the problem, and that younger, well-read adults might also have wisdom and insight into the problems theyâ€™re dealing with.
It doesnâ€™t help that studies have found that older people are more likely to judge younger people harshly compared to qualities they have themselves. As Voxâ€™s Brian Resnick recently explained, a study on a phenomenon called â€œpresentismâ€ showed that â€œadults who are more authoritarian are more likely to say kids today are a lot less respectful of elders than they used to be. Adults who are more well read say kids today are a lot less interested in reading than they used to be. And adults who are more intelligent (as approximated by a very short version of an IQ test) are more likely to say kids are less smart than they used to be.â€
So if an older adult sees themselves as financially successful, respectful, and job-loyal, the study suggests they might be more likely to view a younger person as a financially irresponsible and insolent job-hopper.
This is all arguably a new iteration of the â€œkids these daysâ€ generational cycle that every era experiences â€” at the very least, the backlash to the OK boomer meme underscores the belief held by many millennials that boomers have never understood their generation. But because of the cultural and political moment weâ€™re in, the stakes feel much more fraught and high-risk than other generational clashes.
What â€œOK boomerâ€ is really about: economic anxiety, the threat of environmental collapse, and people resisting change
â€œI talked to my dad about it and he said the reason the â€˜boomersâ€™ get so mad is because they feel as if they earned the right to say such things to us kids because they worked hard for what they have,â€ said 16-year-old Adriana Lepera, who talked to Vox via Instagram. Lepera, a popular TikTok teen with over 120,000 followers, made a viral OK boomer TikTok reacting to a conversation she had with her grandfather. She used the meme to respond to his assertion that she should be working â€” even though she doesnâ€™t even have a driverâ€™s license yet, which she says makes it harder for her to find a job.
â€œAfter my [OK boomer] video, I got a few comments from â€˜boomersâ€™ explaining how many jobs they had and how hard they have to work, proving the joke to be true,â€ she told Vox.
Lepera admits that todayâ€™s teens do have it easier than boomers did in some ways. â€œTodayâ€™s kids are getting things handed to them, and thatâ€™s not what the boomers like to see, so they make cocky comments because they believe that they are â€˜superior,â€™â€ she said.
But she also argues that boomers miss the point â€” that crucial things are a lot harder. â€œWe are working hard to get fewer jobs,â€ she said. â€œThatâ€™s why weâ€™re mad, because all of the boomers made it to be like that.â€
Teens like Lepera understand that the OK boomer meme is driven both by their generationâ€™s deep economic and environmental anxiety, and by progressive values that are growing firmer over time. Younger generations are more diverse, less religious, and more directly impacted by economic inequality than their forebears. â€œOk, Boomer, millennials actually earn 20 percent less than you did,â€ GQ declared in mid-November. Millennials who value work culture, advancement possibilities, and quality of work over quantity are finding their paths to promotions blocked by baby boomers â€” but when they change jobs or careers in search of these things, they find themselves branded with the false stereotype of being disloyal job-hoppers. All the while, student debt remains high, and the economic scandals of the 2000s have led to millennials being more cynical than their elders about the benevolence of corporate overlords.
But many of those offended by OK boomer seem to understand very little of this. Theyâ€™re instead sticking to their guns about the workplace, at least according to the teens who donâ€™t trust them. â€œI feel as if they arenâ€™t changing with the times,â€ Lepera told Vox. â€œThey believe that how they did everything when they were younger, we should do as well.â€
Whether itâ€™s justified or not, boomers are largely perceived as resistant to progressive change. In 2016, boomers were more likely to vote for conservative options like Brexit and Donald Trump than younger voters; statistically, boomers are less concerned about climate change than younger generations. And even after overseeing decades of financial prosperity thatâ€™s arguably wrecked the economic future for decades to come, the richest baby boomers continue to amass wealth for themselves in the face of debilitating economic inequality.
Baby boomers, however, also have to contend with their growing obsolescence. Boomers as a voting bloc are outnumbered by millennials, and thereâ€™s an advancing push among millennials for greater voter turnout; in the 2018 midterm elections, Gen Z, millennials and Gen Xers collectively edged out the voter turnout of everyone older than them.
So the older generation is being told its advice is out of touch, and that boomers are out of touch, at a moment when their views have less traction in the current economic and political landscape than ever. Perhaps thatâ€™s why so many of them keep pushing back against the meme â€” thereby strengthening the memeâ€™s basic point.
The debate around OK boomer is a new spin on the old debate over millennials â€” and an even older debate about kids these days
We all know the immortal cry that parents just donâ€™t understand, but in this case, the media and the cultural narrative around the OK boomer meme isnâ€™t helping â€” especially since so many attempts to â€œexplainâ€ the meme or â€œclap backâ€ have missed the point about why millennials are mad. A few of these attempts have come across as just as out of touch as the memeâ€™s targets.
In an attempt to provide a retort to the meme, Myrna Blyth, the senior vice president of the senior advocacy group AARP, stated in an interview that boomers are â€œthe people that actually have the money.â€ This widely shared quote came in for massive criticism and ridicule, and the AARP quickly apologized, reminding everyone that â€œâ€˜ismsâ€™ that divide us are not OK.â€
But Blythâ€™s statement is a peak example of boomers missing the point. A big cause of younger generationsâ€™ resentment toward boomers is the perception that boomers are hoarding wealth. (This perception is accurate; the average baby boomer has a net worth that is 12 times more than the average millennial.) In particular, her statement highlights the pattern of boomers failing to realize that the perceived ageism of the meme, even as a joke, is a stand-in for rational economic anxieties.
Still, expressing this frustration through the meme seems to make boomers less inclined to listen, which leads to doubling down on all sides. As novelist Francine Prose put it in an op-ed for the Guardian:
The accepted explanation and justification for all this is that the old have ruined things for the young: weâ€™re responsible for climate change, for income inequality, for the cascading series of financial crises, for the prohibitive cost of higher education. Fair enough, I suppose, though it does seem unjust to direct oneâ€™s anger at the average middle-class senior citizen struggling to survive on social security rather than raging at, letâ€™s say, the Koch brothers the Sacklers, the big banks, and the fossil-fuel lobbyists who have effectively dismantled the EPA. OK, Morgan Stanley, have a terrible day.
But to the TikTok teens, the boomersâ€™ sensitivity to the meme just makes them hypocritical. â€œThey feel as if they can say whatever they want about our generation and no repercussion,â€ Lepera told Vox, â€œbut when we make a joke about them itâ€™s the end of the world.â€
In the end, the debate around OK boomer might be another iteration of the endless parade of internet-fueled ideological debates in which neither side is listening to the other. For frustrated millennials and teens, OK boomer is an emotionally valid response to boomer condescension, but to frustrated baby boomers, it sounds insolent and disrespectful: You say, â€œOK boomer,â€ and I hear, â€œyour entire generation has irrevocably destroyed human civilization.â€ Letâ€™s call the whole thing off?
Perhaps, in the future, itâ€™s worth eschewing the meme altogether and having one more conversation across the generation gap. Or, if youâ€™re a boomer, you could take Leperaâ€™s advice:
â€œJust like take a joke and calm down boomer. â€

Alexander Vindman (a National Security Council staffer). The afternoon will feature Kurt Volker (the former US special representative to Ukraine) and Tim Morrison (a National Security Council staffer).
On Wednesday, November 20, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland will testify in the morning. Defense Department official Laura Cooper and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale will testify in the afternoon.
Then, on Thursday, November 21, former National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill is scheduled to testify.
Original post: The first public hearings in the House of Representativesâ€™ impeachment inquiry will kick off at 10 am ET Wednesday, when Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee call their first two witnesses: William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, a State Department official. You can watch them testify on CSPAN or other major networks, as well as streaming live on Voxâ€™s Facebook.
Led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the hearings are intended to publicly spotlight evidence and testimony Democrats believe is quite damning for President Donald Trump â€” evidence that Trump tried to urge or coerce the government of Ukraine into investigating Trumpâ€™s rivals for political reasons.

Whoâ€™s who in the impeachment hearings on Ukraine
Both witnesses, Taylor and Kent, extensively testified behind closed doors to the committee last month and are now expected to reiterate their accounts for the American public.
Taylor had a front-row seat for events at the heart of the scandal as he was working with State Department officials who were trying to get Ukraine to commit to the investigations Trump wanted. And Taylor criticized the effort in real time. â€œAs I said on the phone,â€ Taylor wrote in a text to a colleague, â€œI think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.â€
Kent was based in Washington but he was aware of some of the current scandalâ€™s episodes while they were unfolding. More broadly, he has deep experience in Ukraine and has strong views about whatâ€™s happening here: namely, he believes that corrupt oligarchs and former Ukrainian officials won Rudy Giulianiâ€™s ear.
As the first public testimony in a presidential impeachment inquiry, Wednesdayâ€™s hearing will naturally be historic. However, few are expecting dramatic new revelations, since these witnesses have testified behind closed doors already. The hope, for Democrats, is to throw more of a public spotlight on what Taylor and Kent are saying â€” and, in contrast, Republicans are hoping to discredit them.

The scandal: Trump and Ukrainian investigations
To recap: Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry in September after a scandal broke about President Trump pressuring the government of Ukraine to investigate the family of his potential 2020 rival Joe Biden.
Initially, concerns were raised inside the administration by an anonymous whistleblower, who filed a complaint in August â€” a complaint the administration initially tried to withhold from Congress. â€œI have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,â€ the whistleblower wrote.
The story first told by the whistleblower and then corroborated and expanded on by other witnesses, documents, and reporters since then, goes as follows:
Shortly after Ukraine elected a new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in April 2019, Trumpâ€™s lawyer Rudy Giuliani began urging Zelenskyâ€™s team to launch certain investigations Trump wanted.
Specifically, Trumpâ€™s team demanded investigations into Burisma (a Ukrainian gas company that Joe Bidenâ€™s son Hunter sat on the board of) and into purported Ukrainian interference with the 2016 US election.
When Trump talked to Zelensky on the phone on July 25, he brought up both investigations specifically and urged Zelensky to talk to Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr about them.
The Ukrainians were seeking a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky. Trump officials told them that they wouldnâ€™t get it unless they committed to those investigations: a quid pro quo.
Trump also blocked nearly $400 million in military assistance Congress had approved for Ukraineâ€™s government. One official, Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, admits telling the Ukrainians that they wouldnâ€™t get the aid unless they placated Trump by launching the investigations.
Democratsâ€™ argument is simple: This was an attempt by Trump to solicit foreign help interfering with the 2020 election, itâ€™s a corrupt abuse of power, and they are now seriously considering impeaching Trump for it.
Trump and his defenders, meanwhile, have offered a shifting series of arguments â€” either that the facts on certain matters, such as the withholding of military aid, arenâ€™t clear, or simply asserting that even if Trump did do all this, he shouldnâ€™t be removed from office for it.
The hearings: How theyâ€™ll work
After announcing their impeachment inquiry in late September, Democrats conducted the first stage of it behind closed doors â€” asking various current and former administration officials to come in and give sworn depositions about what happened between Trump and Ukraine.
The effort proved fruitful â€” surprisingly so. Some key officials obeyed a White House instruction to refuse to testify but others, mostly from the State Department or the National Security Council staff, showed up anyway and answered questions. One, Kurt Volker, even turned over a set of text messages that have become key to the investigation.
Democrats used this phase of the inquiry to gather facts about what happened, away from the cameras â€” as well as to figure out which witnesses would be most forthcoming and knowledgeable. Meanwhile, Republicans complained about these closed-door hearings â€” but those Republicans who were on the relevant congressional committees were permitted to attend and participate in the questioning.
So now, Democrats are moving to the next phase: the public hearings. And they intend to run things as follows.
The first round of questioning will be 45 minutes each for Schiff and Devin Nunes, the committeeâ€™s top Republican. However, both Schiff and Nunes are likely to delegate significant amounts of questioning time to staff attorneys â€” specifically, Daniel Goldman for the Democrats and Steve Castor for the Republicans.
This will be a change of pace for congressional hearings. Theyâ€™ll start off with a lengthy block of time for a professional questioner with ample time for follow-ups, rather than the traditional five-minute segments trading off between Congress members of each party. (Democrats believe this approach, which they experimented with at the end of a hearing in September, will be better suited for telling a coherent story.)
After that first 90 minutes is up, the hearing will revert back to that traditional format of five minutes per member of Congress for questioning. Democrats expect things to wrap up sometime between 2:30 pm and 4:30 pm.
The witnesses: William Taylor and George Kent
Democrats have decided to begin their hearings with two witnesses who they have good reason to believe will be helpful to their narrative. Both are State Department officials with long careers and deep experience in Ukraine in particular, and both are rather appalled by what Trump did with Ukraine.
William Taylorâ€™s official title is chargÃ© dâ€™affaires of the US embassy in Kyiv, making him currently the top US diplomat there. His background includes stints in the US Army and in various diplomatic posts (including serving as Ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush).
Taylor was asked to reenter the government this year to replace former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch (though he does not have the ambassador title). He testified that he had some trepidation about accepting the job â€” due to a â€œweb of political machinations, both in Kyiv and in Washington.â€ And indeed, soon after he took up the post in June, he realized that there was a separate, â€œhighly irregularâ€ channel of US policymaking, one that included Trumpâ€™s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland.
Taylor testified that Sondland told him early on â€” all the way back in late June â€” that the Ukrainians had to commit to certain â€œinvestigationsâ€ if Zelensky wanted a White House meeting with Trump. Referring to detailed contemporaneous notes he took, Taylor chronicled how his concern over this increased as the summer went on.
By early September, Taylor said, he grew even more concerned because a colleague told him that Sondland was now linking hundreds of millions of dollars in withheld military aid for Ukraine to the investigations. â€œAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?â€ he asked Sondland in a text. Taylor says Sondland soon spoke to him on the phone and confirmed that he was doing just that â€” at Trumpâ€™s behest. He said something similar in another call on September 8, Taylor testified:
Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman. When a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.
Finally, on September 9, Taylor put his concerns in writing again: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,â€ he texted Sondland. The ambassador then called Trump himself to discuss how to respond.
For a sense of what Taylor will say, check out his full closed-door testimony from last month at this link.
George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, will be testifying alongside Taylor. Kent is a career foreign service officer who has served two stints in Ukraine over the years and took up his current Washington-based post in the summer of 2018. Ukraine is currently one of six countries in his portfolio.
Compared to Taylor, Kent wasnâ€™t as personally involved in the events that transpired in Ukraine this summer. What he will bring to the hearing, though, is deep knowledge of the country, combined with strong opinions on the machinations that have been taking place. Kent made clear in his closed-door testimony that he believes Giuliani has been working with several corrupt current or former officials in Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor generalâ€™s office to push allegations that have no merit.
Kent will also be able to speak authoritatively about the Bidensâ€™ role in Ukraine. He testified that, in early 2015, he did tell a member of Vice President Bidenâ€™s staff that Hunter Bidenâ€™s board seat on the gas company Burisma could be seen as a conflict of interest. However, Kent said, he was told that because Bidenâ€™s other son Beau was dying of cancer, there was no â€œfurther bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.â€
Kent will also debunk the claim from Trump allies that Vice President Biden pressured the Ukrainians to fire a prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, to help Burisma and his son. He testified that the idea to push Shokinâ€™s ouster came from the US Ambassador to Ukraine at the time, not Biden. He also testified that Shokin was extremely corrupt â€” when an anti-corruption unit in Ukraine went after his former driver (and seized a cache of diamonds from him), Shokin â€œwent to warâ€ to try to retaliate against anyone involved in the investigation, Kent said. That is why the US determined he had to go.

Whatâ€™s next after the first hearing
After Wednesdayâ€™s hearing wraps up, the next planned hearing is on Friday, when former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch is slated to testify. She was ousted from her post back in April so she wasnâ€™t around for many of the key events of this scandal. But her fate is a sort of prologue to the story since she is viewed as the victim of a smear campaign from Giuliani and his Ukrainian allies.
The Intelligence Committee is expected to call more witnesses for further hearings next week but this phase of the inquiry will likely conclude before Thanksgiving. After that, the House Intelligence Committee will write a report summarizing their findings.
Once Congress returns in December, the action will shift to Rep. Jerry Nadlerâ€™s House Judiciary Committee, which will review that report and likely draft articles of impeachment against Trump.
Any articles of impeachment approved by the committee will then be sent on to the full House to be voted on. Democrats hope to hold those votes before Christmas. If a majority of the House votes to approve any article of impeachment, then Trump is impeached and the process moves forward to the Senate, which will hold a trial determining whether he should be removed from office.
As for what will happen, the current state of play is that Trump is quite likely to be impeached in the Democrat-controlled House as even most moderate Democrats profess to be disturbed by the Ukraine scandal.
But itâ€™s tremendously difficult to actually remove a president from office. It takes a two-thirds vote in the Senate (a threshold that has never been reached), and that chamber is Republican-controlled anyway. And so far, nearly every Republican senator â€” Mitt Romney being the lone exception â€” remains supportive of President Trump. Democrats hope their hearings will create a public uproar that will reshape that political situation, but that will be a tall order."
"This past weekend served as a fitting cap to a dramatic week of public impeachment hearings â€” and set up this weekâ€™s sessions in riveting style.
On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee, which leads the impeachment process, released a transcript of the closed-door deposition of Tim Morrison, formerly the top Ukraine official on the National Security Council. He revealed that President Donald Trump ordered his staff to withhold military aid to Ukraine in exchange for investigations into Joe Bidenâ€™s family and Democrats.
Further, Morrison testified that Trumpâ€™s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 was so concerning, it merited storing the transcript on a secret server to avoid its potential leak from damaging the White House. However, Morrison maintained the president did nothing illegal.
The committee also released the transcript of the testimony of Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to Vice President Mike Pence on Russian and European affairs. Though not as dramatic as Morrisonâ€™s testimony, Williams corroborated whatâ€™s already known about the scheme and also filled in some details of Penceâ€™s involvement.
Those releases came hours before leaks of a rare Saturday closed-door deposition with Mark Sandy, the deputy associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget. He told lawmakers that his boss, Trump appointee Michael Duffey, took a special interest in the process by which the US distributes funds to other nations. Sandy testified he had never before seen a political official take control of such a portfolio.
On Sunday, the Wall Street Journal revealed that Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, kept Trump administration officials aware of his efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch the desired investigations. Sondland will testify in an open hearing this week, and lawmakers will surely ask him about the coordinated effort.
Also on Sunday, Trump specifically called out Williams for her cooperation with the impeachment inquiry. She and other so-called â€œNever Trumpersâ€ should â€œwork out a better presidential attack,â€ Trump tweeted. That message came just days before Williams is scheduled to appear in a public impeachment hearing, leading some to say the president is attempting to intimidate a witness.
If you missed any of this because you wanted to enjoy your weekend, donâ€™t worry. Weâ€™ve got you covered.
Tim Morrison told leaders of the impeachment inquiry that Trump directed a Ukraine scheme
Last month, reports indicated that Morrison told Congress behind closed doors that there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine. In testimony designed to avoid making Trump look bad, the former White House official confirmed what other witnesses already told investigators: Trump wanted aid to Kyiv withheld to place pressure on Zelensky to open probes into Democrats and Bidenâ€™s family.
But based on the full transcript of his deposition, Morrison told lawmakers a whole lot more.
First, Morrison noted two instances in which Sondland relayed the plot to him.
Morrison said Sondland gave him a quick readout of a September 1 conversation the envoy to the EU had with a top Ukrainian official. â€œHe told me that in his â€” that what he communicated was that he believed the â€” what could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would to go the mic and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation,â€ the former NSC official said, referencing the name of a Ukrainian gas company of which Hunter Biden â€” Joe Bidenâ€™s son â€” sat on the board.
That discussion came on the heels of a meeting between Pence and Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland.
Six days later, Sondland and Morrison spoke again, that time about a call the ambassador just had with Trump.
â€œHe told me he had just gotten off the phone with the president,â€ Morrison said. â€œHe told me ... that there was no quid pro quo, but President Zelensky must announce the opening of the investigations and he should want to do it.â€
Put together, the testimony showed that not only was there a plan to get Ukraine to investigate Trumpâ€™s potential 2020 rival, but that the president was also involved.
Second, Morrison admitted he worried about the potential aftermath of Trumpâ€™s troublesome July 25 call with Zelensky, in part because White House lawyers werenâ€™t aware of what was said during the conversation.
â€œI was concerned about whether or not they would agree that it would be damaging for the reasons I outlined in my statement of the call package â€” if the call [memorandum of conversation] on its contents leaked,â€ Morrison told investigators.

It was already known the summary of the call was stored in an ultra-secret server designed to hold information about the most sensitive intelligence. But Morrison was effectively admitting that one reason he pushed for its placement in the server was to keep its contents hidden. It corroborates the whistleblowerâ€™s charge that there was a White House effort to â€œlock downâ€ access to the transcript.
This was very damaging testimony for Trump â€” and it came from inside the White House.
Jennifer Williams backs known evidence and adds color about Penceâ€™s role
Morrisonâ€™s testimony is the main one to read, but the near-simultaneous release of Williamsâ€™s deposition is also worth your time. A State Department staffer assigned to Penceâ€™s office, Williams provided investigators with more information about the administrationâ€™s Ukraine policy as well as Penceâ€™s role in it.
About the Trump-Zelensky call on July 25, she said, â€œI certainly noted that the mention of those specific investigationsâ€ â€” meaning into Burisma and Democrats â€” â€œseemed unusual as compared to other discussions with foreign leaders.â€ She also said she â€œbelieved those references to be more political in nature,â€ that they served the presidentâ€™s â€œpersonal political agendaâ€ instead of â€œa broader foreign policy objective of the United States.â€
Thatâ€™s quite damning, as she corroborated the substance of the call and explained how it might benefit Trump more than the country he leads. She also noted that before that conversation, she had not heard anything about the Bidens, Burisma, or the Democrats, implying that the focus came from the president and his inner Ukraine circle.
Perhaps the greatest value of her commentary, though, is what she said about Pence.
The vice president fielded a question from Zelensky about the military aid during their September 1 meeting in Warsaw. Per Williams, Pence gave a canned, traditional response to the Ukrainianâ€™s comments. â€œThe VP responded by really expressing our ongoing support for Ukraine, but wanting to hear from President Zelensky, you know, what the status of his reform efforts were that he could then convey back to the president.â€

It has long been US policy to push Ukraine to solve its myriad corruption issues, and American support for the country has been conditioned, in part, on Kyiv making serious strides to curb that problem. The issue, though, is it doesnâ€™t appear that Trump cared about corruption â€” he cared about probes into the Bidens.
Thatâ€™s not foreign policy. Thatâ€™s personal interest.
Mark Sandy, a top OMB official, shed light on the Ukraine aid freeze
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which helps compile and assess the administrationâ€™s spending, doesnâ€™t usually get a lot of attention. But the little-known office is now at the center of the impeachment hearings.
The OMB was told during the summer to hold on to nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, and that order â€” according to witness testimony and US officials â€” went from Trump to acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to the OMB. Some analysts say that violates the law, since the White House decided to withhold the money for non-budgetary reasons without informing Congress, which had already authorized the disbursement of funds.
It was no surprise, then, that House investigators wanted to speak to someone inside the OMB to get a clearer picture of what was going on at the time. Thanks to Sandyâ€™s testimony on Saturday, we now have just that.
According to the Washington Post, Sandy told lawmakers that he signed the first of many letters required to freeze the aid. The letter Sandy signed is dated July 25, the same day as the troublesome Trump-Zelensky call. Sandy and others, however, werenâ€™t given an explanation for why there was a hold in the first place.
Whatâ€™s more, Sandy said that Michael Duffey â€” his boss and a Trump appointee â€” asked to learn more about the apportionment process by which the US provides aid to other countries. That was highly irregular, per Sandy, who said he never saw a political appointee care about the process during his time at the OMB.
Sandy didnâ€™t provide any new information on the reasons for withholding the aid, but he did highlight that the decision and process to do so wasnâ€™t routine. Itâ€™s not necessarily damning testimony, but it is curious. At a minimum, it undercuts assertions by Trump officials, especially Mulvaney, that this kind of thing happens â€œall the time.â€
Sondland kept US officials abreast of the Ukraine scheme before the Trump-Zelensky call
In the weeks leading up to the July 25 Trump-Zelensky call, US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland kept top US officials aware of the plan to have Ukraine open investigations into the Bidens.
Thatâ€™s the major takeaway from a Wall Street Journal story published Sunday. The newspaper got ahold of emails that Sondland sent to people like Mulvaney and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, in which he made them aware of what he was up to.

One July 13 email, for example, showed Sondland trying to organize a Trump-Zelensky meeting before Ukraineâ€™s parliamentary elections eight days later. â€œSole purpose is for Zelensky to give Potus assurances of â€˜new sheriffâ€™ in town,â€ the ambassador wrote to Morrison. â€œCorruption ending, unbundling moving forward, and any hampered investigations will be allowed to move forward transparently.â€ Morrison simply responded that he was â€œtracking.â€
Then on July 19 â€” the day before the originally scheduled Trump-Zelensky call â€” Sondland relayed the message he had just heard from the Ukrainian leader. â€œI talked to Zelensky just now. He is prepared to receive Potusâ€™ call,â€ wrote Sondland. â€œWill assure him that he intends to run a fully transparent investigation and will â€˜turn over every stone.â€™â€

Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.
David Holmes, a staffer at the US embassy in Ukraine, overheard Sondland and Trump discussing similar things, according to testimony he gave Congress last week.
The emails add only more flame to the fire engulfing the ambassador. Sondland is a central player in the ploy to get Ukraine to open up probes to help Trump, which text messages, these emails, and his own written testimony make clear.
Sondlandâ€™s public appearance Wednesday will no doubt be the inquiryâ€™s main event to date.
Trump is trying to intimidate Williams before her public hearing
Williams will testify openly in the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday morning â€” and Trump is keenly aware of this.
â€œTell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just released ststement from Ukraine,â€ Trump tweeted Sunday. â€œThen she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I donâ€™t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!â€
Itâ€™s unclear why Trump singled out Williams, especially since he claims he doesnâ€™t know who she is. But there are likely two reasons why.
First, in here closed-door testimony discussed above, Williams said Trumpâ€™s comments during the July 25 call with Zelensky were â€œunusualâ€ and beneficial to his political aspirations. The president doesnâ€™t like it when someone calls him out for misbehavior, especially when the person is a woman.
Second, Williams works for Pence. Any damaging comments she might make on Tuesday carry more weight because of that. Itâ€™s one thing for a NSC staffer to say something, itâ€™s another for the vice presidentâ€™s staff to denigrate the commander-in-chiefâ€™s case.
As of now, there are no signs that Williams is rethinking testifying on Tuesday, but itâ€™s possible she may be even more careful with her words now that Trump is openly attacking her. That possibility alone adds some heft to the argument that Trump is tampering with a witness, especially since he also tweeted an attack during Fridayâ€™s testimony by Marie Yovanovitch, the ousted US ambassador to Ukraine.
At this rate, expect Democrats to file an â€œobstruction of justiceâ€ article of impeachment against the president, if that moment ever comes.

"In 2014, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told an audience at an event in Florida that the Whistleblower Protection Act should be expanded to include government contractors like former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden. Paul repeated the view in a 2015 speech on the Senate floor in which he praised whistleblowers who had come forward to tell America that the NSA was collecting phone records on a mass scale as part of the Patriot Act â€” which Paul called â€œthe most unpatriotic of acts.â€
But in 2019, Paul seems to feel differently about whistleblowers, at least the individual whose complaint kicked off House Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
At a rally for Trumpâ€™s 2020 campaign in Kentucky last Monday, Paul said, â€œWe also now know the name of the whistleblower. I say tonight to the media, â€˜Do your job and print his name!â€™â€ Heâ€™s argued on Twitter that not only is it essential to reveal the name of the whistleblower but also that to not do so would be a violation of Trumpâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to face his accuser.
But in Paulâ€™s view, the two perspectives make total sense, as does his unwavering support for Trump, whose presidency has pushed a number of libertarians out of the Republican Party altogether. And though some libertarians â€” who once hoped Paul could bring about the â€œlibertarian momentâ€ in American politics â€” have been disappointed by his turn toward Trump, Paul argues he can do more to advance libertarian ideals from inside the halls of power and with the ear of the president.
Shifting views on the importance of whistleblowers
I reached out to Paulâ€™s office, and a representative for the senator said that Paulâ€™s views on whistleblowers have not changed. The representative noted that on November 6, Paul gave a floor speech extolling the importance of whistleblowers and introducing legislation that would extend whistleblower protections to all federal government contractors â€” not just federal employees or contractors within the intelligence community â€” and that would retroactively give that protection to contractors like Snowden.
But the next day, Paul blocked a Senate resolution in support of whistleblowers, terming it â€œfake outrage.â€ And his own legislation, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2019, concludes with this sentence:
Congress reaffirms that, in the case of criminal prosecutions and impeachments arising from the disclosures of whistleblowers, the accused has the right to confront his or her accuser in such proceedings and that right is not superseded by the whistleblower protections.
This is why Paulâ€™s office claimed his stance had not changed: Paulâ€™s calls for the whistleblowerâ€™s unmasking are in this view not about stripping him of his rights, but about allowing the president to â€œconfrontâ€ his accuser.
It is a case Paul makes explicitly in a piece for the Hill, in which he argues that because â€œthe Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to confront oneâ€™s accusers,â€ Trump â€œmust both face his accuser and face questions regarding his own knowledge and activities.â€
It is a case Paul has also made on Twitter:
But that argument doesnâ€™t seem to hold up with legal thinkers, even those who might be supportive of the president. Conservative writer and former US Attorney Andrew McCarthy (who recently published a book lambasting special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation), wrote in National Review of Rand Paul, â€œAs a constitutional lawyer, Rand Paul makes a good medical doctor.â€
McCarthy added that, though the whistleblowerâ€™s anonymity may not be protected by law (while also noting that Paul himself has not said the personâ€™s name), â€œThe Sixth Amendment has nothing to do with impeachment, and it does not advance a claim that the â€˜whistleblowerâ€™ should be outed and questioned.â€
Scott Shackford, an associate editor at Reason Magazine, wrote of Paulâ€™s argument, â€œThe way Paul is talking about revealing the whistleblower now â€” during the investigation itself â€” is akin to the police revealing the names of witnesses to a suspect long before that suspect has been charged with any crime,â€ adding, â€œThe Sixth Amendment does not require the naming of witnesses in an investigation, nor should it.â€
For many libertarians, Paulâ€™s desire to unmask the whistleblower has not been popular. Nick Gillespie, Reasonâ€™s editor-at-large, told me, â€œPaulâ€™s call to out the whistleblower and his insistence that Trump has a constitutional right to face his accuser â€” as if impeachment or just normal politics is a court battle â€” doesnâ€™t play well among most libertarians I talk with.â€
From â€œthe most exciting figure in politicsâ€ to a Trump â€œcheerleaderâ€
Paul entered Congress with a family name virtually synonymous with the libertarian movement (his first name, after all, is in honor of the writer Ayn Rand, a major influence on philosophical libertarianism.) His father, former Rep. Ron Paul, was a three-time presidential candidate and one of the most influential voices in libertarian circles, advocating for non-interventionism abroad, limited government at home, and extreme fiscal conservatism.
Rand Paul managed his fatherâ€™s 1996 congressional campaign, and supporters of his father urged him to run for one of Kentuckyâ€™s two Senate seats â€” which he did, after Rep. Jim Bunning declined to run again, citing Republican opposition.
In a 2009 interview with CNN, Paul said he was running because â€œIâ€™m very worried about our country; Iâ€™m worried about the debt. Iâ€™m worried about what the debt will lead to. Both sides of the aisle â€” Republican and Democrat â€” have been unwilling and afraid to address the deficit, and someoneâ€™s got to.â€ His father said, â€œI think the family sort of expected that he would be the first one to get to politics like this.â€
Paulâ€™s win in 2010, amid the rise of the Tea Party (some members of which viewed Ron Paul as the â€œintellectual godfatherâ€ and â€œbrainâ€), was seen as a harbinger of things to come, not only for the Tea Party but also for libertarian-leaning voters and thinkers across the country. Though there are relatively few Americans who describe themselves as â€œlibertarianâ€ (roughly 11 percent of Americans did so in 2014), the Libertarian Party is the nationâ€™s third-largest political party. A number of Americans hold libertarian-leaning viewpoints, leading to many arguing (granted, not for the first time) that a watershed moment for the ideology was afoot.
As the Cato Instituteâ€™s David Boaz told the Atlantic in 2013, America has a â€œcore libertarian attitude.â€
â€œSkepticism about power and about government, individualism, the idea that weâ€™re all equal under the law, free enterprise, getting ahead in the world through your own hard work â€” all of those ideas are very fundamentally American,â€ Boaz said at the time. And Rand Paul was viewed as the person to take those viewpoints to the highest echelon of American politics.
Former Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican who entered Congress at the same time as Paul, told me, â€œI believe his message was an extension of his fatherâ€™s strong Libertarian principles, and that was pivotal in 2010 as it ushered in the Tea Party movement. That message was that business as usual was not appropriate and that government should get their fiscal house in order, and get out of the business of health care, and donâ€™t apologize for America.â€
Reason Magazineâ€™s Nick Gillespie said that when Paul first entered the Senate back in 2010, he â€œwas the most exciting figure in politics, not just for libertarians but for most thoughtful Americans.â€
In Gillespieâ€™s view, Paul â€œseemed likely to bring what [Reason editor-at-large] Matt Welch and I had called â€˜the libertarian momentâ€™ to fruition: Here was a guy who was talking seriously and persuasively about reducing the size, scope, and spending of the federal government in every dimension; who was attacking police abuses in Ferguson, [Missouri]; calling for an end to the drug war; and reaching out to black and Latino audiences in serious ways; and who said of illegal immigrants, â€˜If you wish to work, if you wish to live and work in America, then we will find a place for you.â€™â€
When he was preparing to run for president, Paul continued to emphasize his desire to see the GOP become a bigger tent, saying in 2014 that the party could not simply be for â€œfat cats, rich people, and Wall Street.â€
But Paulâ€™s more recent actions â€” lambasting the Ukraine whistleblower and demanding his name be revealed publicly, and his seeming enthusiasm for Trump â€” has turned off many libertarians. In a piece for Reason titled â€œRand Paul Wants Whistleblower Outed. Libertarians Want the Old Rand Paul Back,â€ Elizabeth Nolan Brown wrote:
Paulâ€™s enthusiastic and near perpetual support for Trump actions continues to bum out many libertarians â€” who had hoped Rand would turn out more like his father, former Rep. Ron Paul â€” and limited-government conservatives, for whom the Kentucky senator was a bright spot back when the Tea Party movement showed promise and principles. In the #MAGA era, Paul has become one of the biggest cheerleaders of Trump-style Republicanism and a tireless defender of the presidentâ€™s perspective.
Allahpundit, an anonymous blogger for the conservative website Hot Air, told me of Paul, â€œI remember his acceptance speech in 2010, when he beat Trey Grayson in the primary, right at the moment that Tea Party conservatism was catching fire. Grayson was the McConnell-backed establishmentarian, Paul was the populist outsider.â€
The writer added, â€œSpecifically, I remember him addressing Washington and telling him that he had a â€˜message from the Tea Party.â€™ What did that message turn out to be? â€˜Anything for Trump.â€™â€
Paulâ€™s particular calculus on supporting the president is complex: He once called Trump a â€œdelusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag.â€ But he clearly believes that staying within the bounds of the Republican Party â€” and firmly in support of the president â€” is his best option for pushing Trump, and the GOP, in a more libertarian direction. (By contrast, Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian who left the Republican Party in July, has voiced support for impeachment.)
As Gillespie told me, â€œI think heâ€™s trying to figure out ways to advance his agenda, which ultimately is about balancing the budget and scaling back the warfare state. I suspect that he figures heâ€™s got a better chance of getting some or all of that done by being the presidentâ€™s good graces.â€
Ross said much of the same: â€œI donâ€™t think he changed his principles, I think he was made aware of a different manner in which to advocate those principles. Hence his somewhat cordial relationship with this president.â€
A libertarian angel on Trumpâ€™s shoulder?
As conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat argued in 2018, perhaps Trump didnâ€™t defeat libertarian ideals in 2016, but rather reappropriated them for his own purposes â€” most prominently with foreign policy, where Trump ran hard against the Iraq War and interventionism (and against Americaâ€™s intelligence services, of which Paul is a longtime skeptic) and won.
Thatâ€™s where Paul has centered his efforts to influence Trump. For example, he argued against a potential war with Iran during a June appearance on Fox News â€” the presidentâ€™s favorite television channel.
â€œOne of the things I like about President Trump is that he said the Iraq War was a mistake,â€ he said. â€œI think an Iran war would be even a bigger mistake than the Iraq War. We lost over 4,000 soldiers over there. I donâ€™t think we need to get involved in another war.â€
Itâ€™s not as though Paul has stopped fighting Republicans in his efforts to court Trump. He joined Democrats in adding an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that required congressional approval before money could be used in military operations in Iran.
But the problem he faces is that Trumpâ€™s occasional nod to libertarian ideals has little to do with the ideals themselves. After all, troops originally withdrawn from Syria by Trump have now been tasked with protecting Syrian oil fields, and the practice of wiretapping American citizens (something Paul has spoken out against) has not only continued under the Trump administration but also widened, with some of Trumpâ€™s biggest allies voting to maintain Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and give it additional powers (and Trump signing that expansion into law).
On other issues, like the deficit, Paul continues to rail against the Republican status quo, calling for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution â€” and the president doesnâ€™t seem to care. Sure, Trump and Paul may find common ground on certain issues (like the debate over Russian interference), but that seems more to do with what Trump thinks will be most beneficial for Trump.
Despite this, in an interview with libertarian commentator John Stossel, one of Paulâ€™s biggest supporters, he said â€œprogress has been madeâ€ in the fight for libertarian ideals, citing tax cuts, fewer regulations, and Trumpâ€™s call for an end to â€œendless wars.â€
When Stossel noted that Trump â€œhasnâ€™t pulled out of anywhere,â€ Paul responded, â€œCompare it, though, to George W. Bush, who got us involved everywhere. Or President Obama, who sent 100,000 troops to Afghanistan. The rhetoric of President Trump has been, I think, a relief.â€
â€œHas it happened yet? No,â€ he acknowledged. â€œBut I continue to push.â€"
"In her new health care agenda for the first 100 days of her presidency, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) makes a tacit concession: The health care plan Democrats are most likely to pass in the near term is a robust public option.
Warren rolled out a laundry list of health care executive actions on Friday that she said she plans to take in her first few months as president, making her the first Democratic candidate to offer such a robust administrative playbook.
She also laid out her plan to get to Medicare-for-all, beginning with passing a bill at the start of her presidency that would create a new government health plan that would cover children and people with lower incomes for free, while allowing others to join the plan if they choose. Itâ€™s a particularly expansive version of a public option.
Only later, in her third year in the White House, does Warren say she would pursue Medicare-for-all legislation that would actually prohibit private health insurance, as would be required for the single-payer program that she says she, like Bernie Sanders, wants.
As Warren competes with not only Sanders on the left but Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg toward the center for the Democratic nomination, the plan seems like a bit of triangulation on her part. She isnâ€™t backing off her commitment to Medicare-for-all single-payer. But she is putting out a plan that she will argue is more likely to actually pass 18 months from now.
Either bill in Warrenâ€™s two-step plan would face serious challenges: The first requires 50 or so Senate Democrats to agree on a health care plan in early 2021 and then the second even more audaciously needs a Senate supermajority to approve single-payer health care (or an end to the Senate filibuster).
This wonâ€™t win over many Sanders supporters, who see an unnecessary focus on tactics over strategy. The moderates will still assail her plan as unrealistic and politically toxic. Warren, meanwhile, will make the case she has a plan to both pay for and pass Medicare-for-all.
Health care didnâ€™t seem like the senatorâ€™s top priority earlier in the campaign when she spent more time touting the anti-corruption bill she says would be her No. 1 legislative item. But she is now committing to passing a significant health care bill early in her presidency.
Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s plan for transitioning to Medicare-for-all, explained
Warren starts by saying she would push a Democratically controlled Congress to pass a Medicare public option in the first 100 days of her presidency.
The new government insurance plan would immediately cover all children under 18 and every American with an income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $25,000 for an individual, $51,500 for a family of four) with no premiums or cost-sharing. The uninsured and people eligible for free coverage would be automatically enrolled. There would be an opportunity to opt out. At the same time, Americans over 50 would also be eligible to enroll in the existing Medicare program, with new limits on their cost-sharing.
Other Americans, including the 160 million people who get insurance through their work, could choose to join the public option if they wish. For people who did choose to enroll in the government plan, their employer would need to pay a contribution to help cover the cost. People with incomes above 200 percent of the poverty level would be asked to pay premiums (capped at 5 percent of income) and they would have to pay some money out of pocket for medical care; the government plan would cover 90 percent of costs.
In its structure, the Warren public option shares some features with Joe Biden and Pete Buttigiegâ€™s (automatic enrollment for the uninsured, buy-in option for workers, etc.), but its benefits are more generous.
Warren says that, over time, premiums and cost-sharing for the government plan would be reduced to zero, though she doesnâ€™t provide a timeline for doing so. This is a key tenet of Medicare-for-all as written by Sanders and previously endorsed by Warren: no cost-sharing or means-tested premiums.
Her proposed legislation would also expand Obamacareâ€™s existing tax subsidies for private insurance and would allow people who work at larger firms, who are currently ineligible for that assistance, to take advantage of it and buy subsidized private insurance on the lawâ€™s marketplaces if they decline workplace coverage.
So in the short term, Warrenâ€™s legislation as outlined here would create a government backstop plan for the uninsured and certain vulnerable populations (kids, the poor, the near-poor) that also competes alongside private insurance for working people with higher incomes. She leaves the institution of single-payer, without private insurance, for another bill that she says sheâ€™ll pursue before the end of her first term.
The two-step approach â€” instead of one bill with a transition period, as Sanders has written â€” is an attempt to navigate Senate rules and Senate politics.
First, if Democrats manage to win a majority in 2020, it will be a slim one. They could theoretically eliminate the filibuster, but a lot of senators sound reluctant to do that. So any major legislation would likely need to be passed through the budget reconciliation process, which allows a bill to move with just 51 votes but restricts what policies can be included to provisions that directly affect federal spending and revenue. Some provisions of Medicare-for-all, like the prohibition on private insurance, are not thought to be permissible under reconciliation.
And to pass a reconciliation bill with a slim majority, Democrats will need basically every single one of their members to support it. There would be a significant bloc of moderate Democratic senators â€” led by the likes of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) â€” who would need to back whatever health care bill President Warren is trying to pass. Those lawmakers have already said they donâ€™t support Medicare-for-all, but they might be more amenable to the public option that Warren is suggesting as a starting point.
Then, by year three, Warren says sheâ€™d take the final step toward single-payer and advocate for a bill to eliminate private health insurance. That would require 60 votes, so either a difficult-to-imagine Democratic supermajority where the entire caucus supports single-payer, or even more difficult-to-imagine Republican support for the plan.
But if there is one place that Democrats do all agree on health care, itâ€™s that they think Americans, if given the chance to have government health care, will really come to like it. Sanders says thatâ€™s why people will ultimately be happy to give up their private plan and why Pete Buttigieg says he believes a buy-in can be the start of the path to single-payer.
That would defy the recent history of health care reform where parties that pass or even just pursue major changes to US health care pay dearly in the next election, as they did in 1994, 2010, and 2018. But the assumption is baked into each of their plans in a different way.
All the health care executive actions Warren wants to take
Warrenâ€™s plan also broadens her health care agenda beyond Medicare-for-all, the dominant primary debate so far but only a dream if Democrats donâ€™t win the Senate and Mitch McConnell controls the Senate agenda.
In that case, the new Democratic president would be mostly dependent on their administrative power to change health care policy. Warren also detailed her roadmap for executive action, a mix of reversing Trump administration actions and taking her own steps to, in particular, reduce prescription drug and other health care costs.
She says she would:
Reverse the Trump rule that allows states to loosen the ACAâ€™s requirements for insurance benefits
Reverse Trumpâ€™s expansion of short-term health insurance plans, which are not subject to Obamacareâ€™s insurance regulations
Block Medicaid work requirements
Undo Trump administrationâ€™s plans to restrict abortion access and weaken health care protections for LGBTQ people
Use existing government authorities â€” compulsory licensing and march-in rights, both of which could allow the government to revoke a drugâ€™s patent if there is a compelling public interest â€” to allow the production of cheaper versions of insulin, Epipens, opioid overdose medication, and more.
Appoint antitrust enforcers to combat hospital consolidation and anti-competitive mergers of hospital and physician practices
Warrenâ€™s plan here attempts to both finish answering the tough questions about Medicare-for-all (how do you pass it?) and broaden the health care conversation (she also proposes a $100 billion increase in NIH research funding). Health care had become a vulnerable spot in her wonky armor and, mindful of her â€œplansâ€ reputation, she is moving to repair it."
"You can find evidence of a changing climate everywhere on Earth. But nowhere are the changes more dramatic than in the Arctic.
Our worldâ€™s northern polar region is warming twice as fast as the global average. And the consequences are easy to spot. On average, Arctic sea ice extent is shrinking every summer. The Greenland ice sheet is becoming unstable, and melting into the ocean at an accelerating rate.
Many changes in the Arctic are ominous, and some of the most troubling are occurring beneath the surface, in the permafrost. Permafrost is a layer of frozen soil that covers 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere. It acts like a giant freezer, keeping microbes, carbon, poisonous mercury, and soil locked in place.
Now itâ€™s melting. And things are getting weird and creepy: The ground warps, folds, and caves. Roadways built on top of permafrost have becoming wavy roller coasters through the tundra. Long-dormant microbes â€” some trapped in the ice for tens of thousands of years â€” are beginning to wake up, releasing equally ancient C02, and could potentially come to infect humans with deadly diseases. And the retreating ice is exposing frozen plants that havenâ€™t seen the sun in 45,000 years, as radiocarbon dating research suggests.
Thawing permafrost is also a time bomb: Thereâ€™s more carbon stored in the permafrost than in the atmosphere. Melting it risks accelerating global warming even further.
The UNâ€™s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Wednesday released a 1,000-plus page report amassing all the best evidence on how the icy regions of the world and the oceans are threatened by climate change.
Permafrost temperatures keep rising, and the report paints a grim future. Even if the world manages to hit the IPCC target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, around 25 percent of the permafrost near the surface could be lost, the report finds. Changes to the permafrost (among other changes in the ocean and cryosphere) â€œare expected to be irreversible,â€ the report states.

Scientists: humans are rapidly turning oceans into warm, acidifying basins hostile to life
In a more severe scenario where the world continues to increase emissions and we hit 5 degrees of warming, around 69 percent could be lost. That would drastically change the landscape of the Arctic and potentially set off a further acceleration of global warming.
To better understand the strange changes in the permafrost, in 2017, I spoke with Robert Max Holmes, an earth systems scientist with the Woods Hole Research Center. When I reached him by phone, he was in Bethel, Alaska, a small outpost town 400 miles west of Anchorage, and had just come back from an eight-day research and teaching expedition in the wilderness.
A week earlier, Holmes and his students had set up temperature sensors in the soil near their encampment. Their first reading was 0.3Â°C. â€œIt's barely frozen. And we just sort of sat there stunned. You don't know whether to cry or what. Because you're just like: My God, this whole thing is just going to change in a big way.â€
Hereâ€™s how.
1) Permafrost has been frozen for millennia. Thawing it is a huge disruption.

The simplest definition of permafrost is ground that has been frozen for at least two years.
But itâ€™s so much more than that. In much of the Arctic, that ground has been frozen for tens of thousands of years. And a huge amount of it is frozen â€” permafrost rests in 25 percent of all the land area in the Northern Hemisphere.
National Snow and Ice Data Center
The top few inches (up to a few feet) of the permafrost is whatâ€™s known as the â€œactive layer.â€ This topsoil does thaw with yearly seasonal changes, and is home to a thriving ecosystem. So how do scientists know thereâ€™s permafrost underneath it?
â€œWe have these things called thaw depth probes, which is basically just a T-bar, a steel rod that's a centimeter in diameter and 1.5 meters or so long,â€ Holmes says. They poke the ground with it. â€œIt's like pushing a knife through warm butter or something, and then you hit the bottom of the tray, and boomâ€ â€” thereâ€™s your permafrost.
Eventually, if you dig deep enough, the permafrost again thaws due to heat from the Earthâ€™s core.
Permafrost is like the bedrock of the Arctic (you literally need jackhammers to break it apart). But rising air temperatures in the region are chipping away at this bedrock.
â€œHalf the volume of permafrost may be frozen water,â€ Holmes says. â€œWhen that thaws, the water just runs off. The water may head downhill or the water has a lower volume than is ice, so the ground just slumps and kind of falls apart.â€
(The New York Times has a great new interactive showing how much permafrost in the Alaska may inevitably melt.)
Every year, more permafrost grows closer to thawing, and the depth of the â€œactive layerâ€ â€” the top layer of permafrost that thaws in the summertime â€” is growing deeper in the Arctic regions north of Europe, a sign of instability.
2) The biggest threat is carbon

You can think of the Arctic permafrost as a giant kitchen freezer.
If you put organic (carbon-based) matter in your freezer, the food will stay intact. But if the freezer compressor breaks, it will slowly heat up. As it heats up, bacteria begin to eat your food. The bacteria make the food go rotten. And as the bacteria consume the food, they produce carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases and chemicals that smell terrible.
For tens of thousands of years, permafrost has acted like a freezer, keeping 1,400- to 1,6000 gigatons (billion tons) of plant matter carbon trapped in the soil. (Thatâ€™s more than double the amount of carbon currently in the atmosphere.) Some of the plant matter is more recent, and some is from glacial ice ages that radically transformed a lush landscape into a tundra.
â€œPlants are growing in permafrost regions, and when those plants die, because of the cold temperature, they don't fully decompose, so some of that organic carbon is left behind,â€ Holmes says. When the permafrost thaws, â€œit starts to rot, it starts to decompose, and that's what's releasing carbon dioxide and methane,â€ he says.
This is one reason scientists are so worried about a melting Arctic: When the bacteria turn the carbon in the Arctic into C02 and methane, it accelerates a feedback loop. The more methane and carbon released, the more warming. The more warming ... you get it.
A 2014 study in Environmental Research Letters estimates that thawing permafrost could release around 120 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere by 2100, resulting in 0.29Â°C of additional warming (give or take 0.21Â°C). By 2300, another study in Nature Geoscience concludes, the melting permafrost and its resulting carbon feedback loops could contribute to 1.69Â°C of warming. (Thatâ€™s on the high end. It could be as low as 0.13Â°C of warming.)
But these are just estimates, and they come with a good deal of uncertainty. (Thereâ€™s debate over how much greenhouse gases can be released out of the Arctic, and how long it would take.) It all depends on how quickly the Arctic warms. Some of this freed carbon might be taken up by new plant growth, the IPCC report finds. But even so, the report states, carbon released from permafrost will become a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. (Some scientists believe permafrost melt is already generating net positive carbon emissions, with emissions outpacing the ability of plants in the Artic region to capture the carbon.)
The logic here is simple: The more warming, the greater the risk of kick-starting this feedback loop. A study published in Nature Climate Change in 2017 predicted that 1.5 million square miles of permafrost would disappear with every additional 1Â°C of warming.
And carbon isnâ€™t the only pollutant trapped in the ice. A new study in Geophysical Research Letters finds that the Arctic permafrost is the largest repository of mercury on Earth. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin. And scientists now think there is around 15 million gallons frozen in permafrost soils â€” nearly twice the amount of mercury found in all other soil, the ocean, and atmosphere combined.
â€œThe release of heavy metals, particularly mercury, and other legacy contaminants currently stored in glaciers and permafrost, is projected to reduce water quality for freshwater biota, household use and irrigation,â€ the IPCC reports.
Scientists donâ€™t know how much of this mercury could be released, or when, the Washington Post explains. But they do know this: Continued melting will make it more likely for the mercury to be released, pollute the ocean, and accumulate in the food chain.
3) Ancient microbes are waking up
From the air, the arctic still looks pristine and barren. The situation on the ground tells a different story. Johnny Harris / Vox
In August 2016, an outbreak of anthrax in Siberia sickened 72 people and took the life of a 12-year-old boy. Health officials pinpointed the outbreak to an unusual source.
Abnormally high temperatures had thawed the corpses of long-dead reindeer and other animals. Some of these bodies may have been infected with anthrax, and as Wired explained, the soil in Siberia is normally much too cold to dig deep graves. â€œThe disease from thawing human and animal remains can get into groundwater that people then drink,â€ Wired reported.
Scientists are worried that as more permafrost thaws, especially in Siberia, there may be more outbreaks of long-dormant anthrax as burial grounds thaw.
Thatâ€™s because the deep freeze of the permafrost doesnâ€™t just keep carbon from escaping â€” it keeps microbes intact as well.
Permafrost is the place to preserve bacteria and viruses for hundreds of thousands â€” if not a million â€” years, explains Jean-Michel Claverie, a genomics researcher who studies ancient viruses and bacteria. â€œIt is dark, it is cold, and it is also without oxygen. â€¦ There is no [ultraviolet] light.â€ All the bacteria need is a thaw to wake back up. â€œIf you take a yogurt and put it in permafrost [that remains frozen], Iâ€™m sure in 10,000 years from now it still will be good to eat,â€ he said in a 2017 interview.
Claverie is part of a scientific team that determined itâ€™s possible to revive 30,000-year-old viruses trapped in the permafrost. His work is centered on viruses that infect amoebas, not humans. But thereâ€™s no reason why a flu virus, smallpox, or some long-lost human infection couldnâ€™t be revived the same way. These microbes are like time travelers â€” and they could thrive waking up in an age when humans have lost an immune defense against them.
I asked Claverie if thereâ€™s an upper limit to how long viruses and (certain types of) bacteria could survive in the permafrost.
â€œThe limit is the limit given by the permafrost,â€ he explained, meaning he sees no limit. Permafrost is 1,000 meters deep in places, â€œwhich make it about a million, 1.5 million year old,â€ he said.
The danger here, he emphasized, is not from the slow thawing of the permafrost itself. That is, if the permafrost melts, and we leave the land alone, weâ€™re unlikely to come into contact with ancient deadly diseases. The fear is that the thawing will encourage greater excavation in the Arctic. Mining and other excavation projects will become more appealing as the region grows warmer. And these projects can put workers into contact with some very, very old bugs.
The threat is tiny. But it exists. The big lesson is that even viruses thought to be eradicated from Earth â€” like smallpox â€” may still lurk frozen, somewhere.
â€œWe could actually catch a disease from a Neanderthalâ€™s remains,â€ Claverie says. â€œWhich is amazing.â€
4) Roadways are warping, foundations are shifting
When the permafrost melts, it literally changes the landscape, causing the ground to slump, and ripple.
In Bethel, Alaska, roadways are literally warping as the ground beneath them becomes less solid. In other places, the melting permafrost is creating craters and sinkholes. â€œYou see buildings that are kind of slumping into the ground; you see that a lot in the Russian Arctic,â€ Holmes says. Civil engineers are experimenting with new types of pilings and foundations to help keep Arctic buildings on strong footing.
There is one crater in Siberia so large itâ€™s gotten the nickname ""doorway to the underworld.â€ Itâ€™s a kilometer long and up to 100 meters deep. And itâ€™s growing larger every year.
The IPCC report underscores this as well: Melting permafrost will transform the landscape. Lakes will increase by 50 percent by 2100 under a high-emissions scenario. Meanwhile, after the soils melt, they may start to dry out, and increase the likelihood of wildfire in polar regions.
5) When we lose the permafrost, we lose a record of natural history
Johnny Harris / Vox
There are dangers buried in the permafrost. But there are also natural treasures yet to be discovered. The ice preserves all: ancient animal remains and human history in the region. Think of Ã–tzi, the remarkably preserved 5,000-year-corpse found in the Alps. If he had thawed, what was left of his body would have decomposed, and a window into the world he lived in would have been lost forever.
There may be other Ã–tzis in the Arctic. Or preserved bits of mammoth DNA yet to be discovered. The melting may make some of these treasures briefly accessible â€” freed from the ice â€” but also threatens to quickly destroy them. According to Scientific American, once a specimen is uncovered and thawed, researchers have a year at most to recover it before it completely breaks down.
Are there any benefits to melting permafrost?
â€œOne story I heard of in Bethel is that there are people who are happy that now they can dig a basement,â€ Holmes says.
There are some benefits of thawing permafrost. For one, farming is now possible in parts of Alaska, as NPR reports. And â€œSo it's not that it's all a bad news story,â€ Holmes says, â€œbut I'd say the silver lining is pretty thin and pretty small in relationship to the larger-scale negatives.â€"
"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have fused two major presidential campaign issues â€” housing and climate change â€” in a $172 billion policy proposal released Thursday.
Dubbed the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act, the proposal aims to transform the entire stock of public housing in the US, 1.2 million units, into energy-efficient homes powered by onsite renewable energy. Authors say the bill would create about 240,000 jobs per year and reduce greenhouse emissions equivalent to taking 1.2 million cars off the road.
This is the first piece of legislation with official Green New Deal branding and is co-written by Sanders, one of the progressive frontrunners for the 2020 presidential race. The initial Green New Deal resolution released in March by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) was a broad framework that laid out principles for a comprehensive strategy to limit climate change, like the need for a just transition toward cleaner energy. This new bill actually starts constructing policy within that framework.
â€œThis is really important, itâ€™s an exemplary specification of what targeted green investment would look like,â€ said Daniel Aldana Cohen, the lead researcher on a Green New Deal study by progressive think tank Data for Progress.
By starting with housing, the legislators appear to be trying to make inroads with a broad political base and avoid some of the more contentious aspects of the Green New Deal, like the transition away from fossil fuels. That issue in particular has divided labor unions because it would lead to the end of mining and drilling jobs.
The Green New Deal has risen in popularity since the resolution was introduced in February; an NPR/PBS Newshour/Marist poll this summer showed 60 percent of registered voters supported it, including 86 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents (Republicans were decidedly less in favor).
Both public housing and climate change have also emerged as critical issues in the 2020 campaign for president. Sanders already has a housing-for-all plan, and fellow contenders including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and former HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro have also released in-depth housing plans. And Democratic primary voters rank climate change and housing as high priorities.
But to make a difference, the Green New Deal housing bill has to do more than rally climate and housing activists; it must build up a broad base of support throughout the country and in government. The prospects of passing such legislation are dim in the current Congress, but it could tee up a policy agenda for the next administration. Regardless of the outcome of the next election, climate change and housing will not go away as national concerns.
Public housing is an important venue for fighting climate change
Buildings â€” homes, hotels, offices, and stores â€” account for 40 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions. Though building codes have ramped up efficiency standards for new construction, many older, leakier, draftier homes and offices remain and will continue to be occupied for decades. Overall energy use in buildings is still rising. That means upgrading and retrofitting structures to use less energy and emit less is a critical tactic in fighting climate change.

Since most real estate is in private hands, public housing offers an avenue for the federal government to get involved. The 1.2 million units range from single-family homes to apartments in high-rises, making it a useful policy laboratory for different kinds of energy interventions.
While these homes receive federal support, they are often managed by local authorities. And many of these homes are in dire need of maintenance and improvement: According to the Urban Institute, most public housing in the US is at least 40 years old â€œand needs major capital repairs like new windows, plumbing, roofs, and heating systems to keep it operational.â€
The Green New Deal housing bill would issue grants to upgrade buildings to make them more energy efficient, including installing solar panels and insulating walls and windows. Upgrades would also be made to things inside the units, including installing all-electric modern appliances, energy-efficient lightbulbs, and low-flow toilets to reduce water usage. Lead pipes leaching toxins into drinking water would be replaced, and public housing in areas vulnerable to effects of climate change would be made more resilient.
Public housing residents typically have lower incomes, which means they would benefit immensely from the grants. A 2016 report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that low-income households pay double the share of income for energy compared to the US median. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, energy costs can eat up almost one-fifth of the annual income for single, elderly, poor, and disabled persons living on Social Security. The national average of income spent on energy is 4 percent.
So directing energy efficiency upgrades to public housing yields dividends for many of the people who need it most. And deploying such measures means creating jobs in these communities.
The Green New Deal for Public Housing Act aims to use jobs to spread the benefits of a transition to clean energy across the country
Beyond its already ambitious target of retrofitting all public housing to become more energy-efficient, the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act has another massive component: It aims to employ the people who live in the public housing units to do these 1.2 million upgrades around the country.
Data for Progress research estimates the bill would create over 240,000 jobs per year across the United States â€” and not just in blue states. The research estimated it would create up to 17,489 skilled construction and maintenance jobs per year in red states, compared to up to 9,428 of those jobs in blue states. But of course, that would depend on red states deciding to accept federal money â€” which history shows isnâ€™t always a given.

â€œIf Republicans are going to oppose this, theyâ€™re going to have to defend keeping jobs and benefits away from their own constituents,â€ said Aldana Cohen. â€œPublic housing is a national issue across party lines. Why should red places miss out on the green 21st century economy? It doesnâ€™t make sense.â€
Much of the billâ€™s funding would come from repealing the 2017 tax cuts passed by Republicans. â€œI refuse to allow Republicans to set a progressive policy to fail because they decided to run up a credit card to tax to give freebies to their friends,â€ Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post.
The bill also calls for hiring workers â€œto the greatest extent practicableâ€ from public housing residents, people living within 50 miles of work sites, armed forces veterans, formerly incarcerated people, and union workers. And it repeals the Faircloth Amendment to the Housing Act of 1937. This provision prevents HUD from funding projects that would increase the number of housing units under its management. This amendment has been a major hurdle for constructing new public housing.
Housing is a major campaign issue in the 2020 campaign for president, but many of these problems canâ€™t be solved from the White House
Public housing is just one front in a vast reckoning over where and how people will live in the US. California is one of many states suffering from an acute housing shortage, which is driving up the cost of living and forcing people into substandard housing or out of cities altogether.

Across the US, there is a growing movement to change zoning to allow higher-density housing to relieve pressure on the market. Some cities are experiencing a rise in homelessness.
But housing policies are largely governed at the state and local level, which means the president has few levers for shaping how people live. As Voxâ€™s Matt Yglesias explained, federal housing subsidies and bolstering the social safety net would go a long way to help low-income families secure housing. But the thornier problem of not enough homes in areas with the best job opportunities requires a more coordinated response across all levels of government.
The Green New Deal public housing bill is a step toward solving this by creating more jobs and more housing at the same time."
"On Wednesday, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) sent out 23 consecutive tweets whose first letters spelled out a startling claim: EPSTEIN DIDNâ€™T KILL HIMSELF.
Gosar has coyly resisted confirming that he was alleging that hedge fund manager and convicted sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein was murdered. But his tweets were hardly anomalous. Epsteinâ€™s death has sparked a ton of conspiracy theorizing, and â€œEpstein didnâ€™t kill himselfâ€ has become a bona fide meme, showing up in signs at college football games and posts by influential pundits like Joe Rogan.
To be clear, the New York City medical examiner has ruled that Epstein died by suicide. A former NYC medical examiner hired by Epsteinâ€™s brother has disputed this finding, but that examiner was fired after a long string of errors on his watch, making his word a little untrustworthy.
But that hasnâ€™t stopped prominent individuals, up to and including Donald Trump, from joining in the speculation. The day of Epsteinâ€™s death, President Trump retweeted a conservative personality who captioned a video in which he pontificates at length about his theories with â€œwe know who did thisâ€ and the hashtags #ClintonBodyCount and #ClintonCrime family. Trump was clearer than Gosar in suggesting who he thought had Epstein killed: Bill and/or Hillary Clinton.
To understand whatâ€™s going on here, you donâ€™t just need to know about Epsteinâ€™s former friendship with Clinton (or with Trump). You just need to understand the role that allegations of murder by the Clintons have played in right-wing fever swamps since the 1990s, beginning with the suicide of Vince Foster and continuing through to the completely random 2016 murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.
What is the â€œClinton Body Countâ€?
According to a history and debunking first published by Snopes in 1998, the body count meme originated in 1993 with Indianapolis lawyer and militia movement activist Linda Thompson, who compiled a list of 34 people connected to the Clintons who had died and titled it, â€œThe Clinton Body Count: Coincidence or the Kiss of Death?â€ William Dannemeyer, a notoriously homophobic former Congress member from Orange County, California, picked up the list, trimmed it to 24, and sent it congressional leadership in 1994 as he ran for the US Senate.
Thompson provided â€” by her own admission â€” â€œno direct evidenceâ€ that the Clintons were responsible for any of the deaths, and Snopes provides a comprehensive account of all of them, most of which were easily explained heart attacks, plane crashes, or suicides.
The most notable name on the list is Vince Foster, the deputy White House counsel who died by suicide on July 20, 1993. Foster was a colleague of Hillary Clintonâ€™s at the Rose Law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, and came to Washington, DC, as part of the crew of Arkansas loyalists who joined the Clinton administration. In the job, Foster helped conduct vetting of administration officials and said he felt like he had failed the president when Clintonâ€™s first two picks for attorney general were forced to withdraw because of revelations that they had hired undocumented immigrants.
Foster also became wrapped up in a scandal surrounding the firing of staff in the White House travel office and in legal disputes about access to records about Hillary Clintonâ€™s health care task force, earning him a bevy of harsh Wall Street Journal editorials.
Overwhelmed by these circumstances, and clearly struggling from depression, Foster fatally shot himself. But almost immediately, conservatives jumped on the idea that Foster was murdered. Those fanning the flames included the Journal editorial board, National Reviewâ€™s Richard Brookhiser, and then-Rep. Dan Burton, who tried to do some amateur ballistics research on the case by shooting a large fruit in his backyard. Reports differ as to whether Burton shot a watermelon, a pumpkin, or a cantaloupe.
Numerous investigations, as my colleague Matt Yglesias explains here, have found that Foster died by suicide. But the eagerness of conservatives, both on the more conspiratorial right and in respectable places like the Journal editorial board (Brookhiser favorably reviewed a book casting doubt on the suicide investigation in the New York Times), to doubt those findings fed the idea of a â€œClinton Body Count.â€ So in the future, when people connected to the Clintons died because of easily understandable causes (like former business partner Jim McDougalâ€™s heart attack death in prison), their deaths became grounds for speculation.
The death of Seth Rich in 2016 was the next major event fueling Clinton Body Count conspiracies. Rich was a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee staffer who was shot in what police believed to be an attempted robbery in DC. But almost as soon as he died, Clinton haters seized on his death and tried to argue that Hillary and/or Bill was responsible. After these rumors began, Julian Assange of Wikileaks gave the conspiracy theorists a motive by hinting that Rich, not Russian hackers, provided WikiLeaks with the DNCâ€™s emails. WikiLeaks then offered a $20,000 reward for information about Richâ€™s death. The implication was that Richâ€™s killing was punishment for leaking damaging internal emails.
This conspiracy theory was always absurd; there is copious evidence of Russian hacking, Rich had no access to all of the DNCâ€™s internal emails, and he certainly didnâ€™t have access to all the other information Russia recovered, like Clinton campaign chief John Podestaâ€™s emails. The Rich family would eventually sue Fox News unsuccessfully for its efforts to spread the conspiracy theory.
But for Clinton Body Count conspiracy theorists, the incoherence of the theory in the Rich case was never an impediment. The Rich theory soon became part of the broader QAnon conspiracy theory, which is too byzantine to explain in detail here but which my colleague Jane Coaston summarizes as arguing that â€œspecial counsel Robert Mueller and President Donald Trump are working together to expose thousands of cannibalistic pedophiles hidden in plain sight (including Hillary Clinton and actor Tom Hanks).â€ Obviously, the victims of Clintonâ€™s cannibalistic pedophilia would be additions to the body count.
How this fits in with Epstein
The Foster, Rich, and QAnon allegations are clearly absurd. And, we should be very clear, there is no firm evidence at this juncture to suggest that Epstein was murdered, let alone murdered by people with ties to the Clinton.
Epstein did have very real ties to Bill Clinton. That does not mean that Clinton had anything to do with his death, any more than allegations that Donald Trump raped a 13-year-old girl while hanging out with Epstein mean that Trump had something to do with Epsteinâ€™s death.
My colleague Andrew Prokop summarized Clintonâ€™s interactions with Epstein thusly:
According to the Daily Beastâ€™s Emily Shugerman, Epstein visited the White House for a donor event during Bill Clintonâ€™s presidency and met with a White House aide several times there. Shugerman also unearthed a 1995 letter from businesswoman Lynn Forester in which she said she enjoyed briefly meeting Clinton at a recent event and used her â€œfifteen seconds of access to discuss Jeffrey Epstein and currency stabilization.â€
Soon after Bill Clinton concluded his presidency in 2001, the ties deepened. Clinton entered a new stage of his career, in which heâ€™d travel the world, launch philanthropic initiatives, hang out with rich people and celebrities, and make money.
â€œWhat attracted Clinton to Epstein was quite simple: He had a plane,â€ Landon Thomas Jr. wrote in that 2002 New York magazine profile. Clintonâ€™s aide Doug Band made the introduction, and that September, Epstein and Clinton were off on a tour of five African countries, alongside actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. Per Clintonâ€™s team, the trip was about â€œdemocratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.â€ (It was that trip that first elevated Epstein to some media notoriety, as journalists began to dig into Clintonâ€™s new friend.)
That wasnâ€™t the only trip. According to Clinton spokesperson Angel UreÃ±a, in a statement last week, there was one more to Africa, one to Europe, and one to Asia â€” but, he says, Clinton and Epstein havenâ€™t spoken in â€œwell over a decade.â€
Virginia Giuffre has said in an affidavit that Clinton was also present on Little St. James Island, Epsteinâ€™s private island in the US Virgin Islands. But so far, there has been no corroboration for this claim, and UreÃ±a says Clinton has never been there.
Neither Giuffre nor any other Epstein accuser has alleged that Clinton had sex with them. Clinton was, however, credibly accused of rape by Juanita Broaddrick in the 1970s.
What makes the conspiracy theories so frustrating, in part, is that theyâ€™re premised on real elements: credible accusations of sexual misconduct against Bill Clinton, Clintonâ€™s real ties to Jeffrey Epstein, and Epsteinâ€™s own well-documented sex crimes. It doesnâ€™t take incredibly inventive conspiracy theorizing to move from that to allegations that Clinton was part of Epsteinâ€™s sex abuse and from there to wild accusations that Clinton had Epstein killed.
But we should be very clear that as of this writing, there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest someone ordered Epsteinâ€™s death, and certainly no evidence whatsoever that Bill Clinton was that person."

My guest is Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California whose most recent book, The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class documents the rise of a new, unprecedented elite class in the United States. Previously, the elite classes differentiated themselves from the rest by purchasing expensive material goods like flashy clothes and expensive cars. But, for reasons we get into, todayâ€™s elite is different: We signify our class position by reading the New Yorker, acquiring elite college degrees, buying organic food, breastfeeding our children, and, of course, listening to podcasts like this one.
These activities may seem completely innocent â€” perhaps even enlightened. Yet, as we discuss here, they simultaneously shore up inequality, erode social mobility, and create an ever-more stratified society â€” all without most of us noticing. This is a conversation that implicates us all, and, for that very reason, it is well worth addressing.

"Thereâ€™s a TikTok thatâ€™s just a boy saying, â€œI may be ugly, but at least Iâ€™m also â€¦ dumb and annoying.â€ Then he dances while Ariana Grandeâ€™s â€œSuccessfulâ€ plays. Itâ€™s extremely funny, and a little bit sad, and I think about it every day.
Kids on TikTok call themselves ugly all the time, most of the time as a joke, but not always, and Iâ€™m never sure how Iâ€™m supposed to feel about it. â€œWhy do I look like this? Whatâ€™s the reason?â€ asked the popular TikToker @emmwee in her car without makeup. â€œMe being shocked at how ugly I look,â€ wrote Brittany Tomlinson, better known as the kombucha girl, at one moment in an unrelated video. â€œI like a boy but Iâ€™m ugly, what do I do with that?â€ sings 18-year-old high school senior David Postlewate, in one TikTok about a highly familiar experience.
David isnâ€™t ugly by any means â€” none of these kids are â€” but the internet has created a never-ending conveyor belt of people so bafflingly good-looking that everyone else is immediately rendered ugly by comparison. â€œI know that Iâ€™m not going to look like Benji Krol,â€ says David, referring to the TikToker with a nest of raven hair and 5.6 million followers. â€œBut Iâ€™m my own person, and thatâ€™s what makes you beautiful,â€ he says, not consciously referring to the One Direction song.
The thing about TikTok is that as much as it is a place for teenagers to goof off in their bedrooms, it is also the worldâ€™s largest beauty pageant. After all, part of the fun about making TikToks is getting to stare at your face for as long as you want, and if you happen to be very, very beautiful, then other people will enjoy staring at your face, too. A stunningly massive portion of the app is devoted to genetically blessed users, e-boys like Benji Krol and human Barbies like Loren Gray. A scroll through the TikTokâ€™s home For You feed will reveal plenty of content where, despite whatever action is going on in the video, the real takeaway is â€œIâ€™m hot.â€
It is against this backdrop that its inverse, â€œIâ€™m uglyâ€ culture, has proliferated. Rather than trying to compete for views and likes with the genetically gifted, kids are pivoting to self-deprecation in a way thatâ€™s less depressing than it might seem to concerned parents: itâ€™s a reclamation of mediocrity in an online space where everyone else is an overachiever.
17-year-old Annie Pham was satirizing TikTokâ€™s culture of hot people and glow-ups when she made her viral video in late August. Using a popular meme where people would show their â€œbeforeâ€ selves and their â€œafterâ€ selves on the beat drop, Annieâ€™s instead showed her â€œbeforeâ€ self trying and failing to transform. â€œWhy isnâ€™t it working?â€ she complains to the camera. â€œAfter like, a week, I was reading the comments, and it was really cool to see how much people relate to it,â€ she says.
Relatable videos are why people like TikTok in the first place, and feeling unattractive on TikTok is one of the most relatable experiences of all. David, of the â€œI like a boy but Iâ€™m uglyâ€ video, for instance, has a TikTok bio that reads â€œugly is my only personality trait.â€
David only made the video because thatâ€™s what was happening in his life: He liked a boy who he thought was out of his league. (â€œHeâ€™s really cute, he goes to my school. Weâ€™re both in theater,â€ he says.) He describes himself as a â€œreally confident person,â€ by the way. He just doesnâ€™t take himself all that seriously.
Normal kids have created an entire genre of internet comedy devoted to how constantly seeing exceptional talent and beauty go viral makes the rest of us feel like ugly losers. On my feed I see videos of kids turning the shitty aspects of their lives into funny content: their most embarrassing sports mistakes, hideous childhood photos, dilapidated apartments, unfortunate haircuts, leg nipples, imprisoned parents, disproportionately long thumbs, sexual ineptitude, mental illness. And of course, their minor physical insecurities: girls who feel like theyâ€™re asymmetrical, girls who hate their smiles, girls who have a cute, pretty face but a body that â€œlooks like a fucking potato.â€
The layers of irony on any social media app that young people are using can be difficult for adults to parse, but when it relates to topics like body image and self-esteem, psychologists take it seriously. â€œI kind of celebrate what theyâ€™re doing â€” theyâ€™re trying to push back on the idea that we all look perfect on social media,â€ says Sara Frischer, a psychiatric nurse practitioner at Union Square Practice in New York City. â€œBut I think itâ€™s just a little misguided in how theyâ€™re doing it. Itâ€™s deflection, and itâ€™s self-protective to then make a joke about it. It protects people from feeling vulnerable.â€ She gives the example of being a bad speller. If you say to yourself that youâ€™re the worst speller in the world, thatâ€™s protecting yourself from someone else pointing it out.
But what if youâ€™re just objectively a bad speller? What would true acceptance of that fact even look like? â€œThatâ€™s where self-compassion comes in,â€ she says. â€œSaying, â€˜This is something I really struggle with, and I just happen to not be such a great speller.â€™ Having compassion for yourself, talking about how hard it is to struggle with this, and all the emotions involved. Itâ€™s adding self-compassion instead of self-deprecation. Thatâ€™s the missing element.â€
â€œIâ€™m uglyâ€ culture has spread so far on TikTok that now even TikTokâ€™s â€œpretty peopleâ€ are co-opting sounds and memes meant for those self-described uglies. Thatâ€™s given way to a wider culture of policing, wherein those usersâ€™ comments sections are flooded with fishing rods to signify that theyâ€™re fishing for compliments.
In July, Ryan Sterling, a 23-year-old in the Chicago suburbs who has had alopecia since he was in middle school, uploaded a video that begins with a picture of Britney Spears with a shaved head followed by a picture of Mr. Clean, and then himself: â€œIt all started when my mom met my dad, then they fell in love, and they had me. Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan,â€ he says. â€œAnd my life? Itâ€™s kinda crazy.â€
Within a few weeks, the â€œHi, Iâ€™m Ryanâ€ video had spawned a massive viral meme, even ending up on a segment of Ellen. But whereas Ryanâ€™s original video made fun of the way he looked, iterations that came after â€” often where a person would show their two very attractive parents and the punchline was their even more attractive self â€” were little more than excuses to brag. In September, Ryan posted another TikTok directed at them: â€œGet off my sound, itâ€™s for ugly people!â€ he says. â€œAll you pretty-ass people with your pretty parents and your perfect genes, get out of here! We uglies and the balds and the grosses and the ickies, we need to fight back!â€
Olivia Chesney, a 19-year-old at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, was in the middle of homework when she went into the bathroom to make a random video. Sheâ€™s standing in front of the mirror and asking, â€œWhy do I be looking so good from the front?â€ Then she turns to the side and bursts out laughing. The joke is that she looks bigger that way, and the video now has more than 2.5 million views.
That video isnâ€™t the only TikTok sheâ€™s made about her body, and not all of them are self-deprecating. Thereâ€™s one where she shows cute photos her friends have taken of her, and another lip synching to the 1958 swing song â€œThe Bigger the Figure.â€
Olivia, like all of us, lives in a world where even if you arenâ€™t born skinny, or distractingly gorgeous, or whatever, youâ€™re still supposed to do everything you possibly can to become those things; to starve your body down and add on some lip fillers until youâ€™re deemed presentable. Americans continue to spend more money on plastic surgery and weight loss plans every year, and one study of UK youth showed that Instagram had the worst effect on body image among any social media site. There are an ever-growing number of billion-dollar industries built upon the profits that come from making people feel awful about themselves, even if those products are shrouded in the aesthetics of positivity and empowerment.
Calling yourself ugly on TikTok, then, is a form of freedom from the expectation of hotness. Itâ€™s a self-deprecating in-joke that only excludes the extraordinarily beautiful, who could maybe stand to be excluded from something for once.
â€œIâ€™m uglyâ€ culture on TikTok also obfuscates its happier subtext: That yeah, itâ€™s okay to be ugly, because now you can focus on more important things. Olivia explains this feeling while talking about a video where she calls herself fat: â€œPeople who are ugly, people who are fat, itâ€™s just like, why are we trying to hide it anymore? We can still live our lives and be that way.â€
Itâ€™s not like â€œuglyâ€ people donâ€™t lead happy lives or fall in love or get rich or go viral on TikTok. The boy that David sang about? The one he liked? Itâ€™s possible that theyâ€™re maybe, sort of in the process of getting together.
â€œIf Iâ€™m going to be completely honest, and I donâ€™t know yet because things havenâ€™t really been official,â€ he tells me, â€œbut I think that stuff is starting to happen with him.â€ Itâ€™s all extremely beautiful.

"In the far reaches of the country, tucked away near the ocean, some people are going out of their way to avoid the many pleasant things life has to offer. Online movies. Rich foods. Friendly conversations. Eye contact.
No, these people are not monks. Theyâ€™re adherents of a different gospel: a hot new Silicon Valley lifestyle trend called dopamine fasting.
The practice has caught on â€” or at least caught on in enough of a high-profile community that the media, including the New York Times, has begun to publish article after article about it. So, what is it exactly?
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in our brainâ€™s system for motivation, reward, and pleasure. When we encounter something like a delicious cupcake or a cute puppy photo on Facebook, dopamine gets released in the brain.
The idea behind dopamine fasting is that we may be getting too much of a good thing in todayâ€™s attention economy, and we need to carve out time without stimulation from things that can become addictive â€” smartphones, TV, internet, gaming, shopping, gambling â€” so that we can regain control over how we spend our time.
Cameron Sepah, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UC San Francisco, popularized dopamine fasting in August when he published a guide to the practice on LinkedIn. â€œTaking a break from behaviors that trigger strong amounts of dopamine release (especially in a repeated fashion) allows our brain to recover and restore itself,â€ he wrote.
Sepah suggested that without such breaks, we become habituated to high levels of the chemical, so we feel the need to seek out ever-higher doses of stimulation to achieve the same pleasurable effect.
Heâ€™s gotten a number of his clients â€” many of them Silicon Valley executives â€” to adopt dopamine fasting, which he says is based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an evidence-based treatment approach that helps people change unhelpful ways of thinking that influence their behavior. CBT is often used to treat addictions.
But dopamine fasting has since been adopted by folks (mainly in the Bay Area) who are taking it to extremes.
In October, a woman tweeted about her perplexity upon encountering one such faster: â€œIn an instance of the Bay Area being very Bay Area: today was my first day in SF since moving here, and I ran into someone from my [Y Combinator] batch who told me he was on a â€˜dopamine fastâ€™ and thus had to cut our convo short (lest he acquire too much dopamine).â€
James Sinka, a young, San Francisco-based startup founder and dopamine faster, told the New York Times, â€œI avoid eye contact because I know it excites me. I avoid busy streets because theyâ€™re jarring. I have to fight the waves of delicious foods.â€
The rise of dopamine fasting is unsurprising amid what we might call the ascetic turn of Silicon Valley. In recent years, tech bros and those they influence have been embracing monkish practices. The prime example is Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who rhapsodizes about the benefits of intermittent fasting, where you abstain from food for hours or days at a time.
And now that dopamine fasting has taken off, at least in the Bay Area, itâ€™s being interpreted by some adherents in the most ascetic way possible.
But is there actually something to dopamine fasting? Or is this just another fad, one based on shoddy science? For that matter, is it just reinventing the wheel â€” taking a practice we already know is good for us and giving it the sheen of cool by couching it in neuroscientific terms, then marketing it back to us?
Where did the term â€œdopamine fastingâ€ come from?
Sepah didnâ€™t invent the name â€œdopamine fasting.â€ The term has been used on internet discussion forums since at least 2016. A man named Greg Kamphuis launched â€œThe Dopamine Challengeâ€ and took to Reddit to invite people to join him in a 40-day fast from â€œTV, refined sugar, alcohol, processed fats, nicotine, recreational drugs, caffeine, and pornâ€ while also â€œmaking deliberate choices about meal times, social media, and shopping.â€
Kamphuis described the fast as his â€œdesperate attempt to get healthy and motivatedâ€ and to â€œsacrifice a few weeks of pleasure to search for a lifetime of joy.â€
Right there we see a common misconception about dopamine: People often think of it as â€œthe pleasure molecule,â€ that thing in our brains that makes us feel good. But neuroscientists will tell you thatâ€™s oversimplifying to the point of inaccuracy.
Dopamine is involved in the complex process of reward-based learning, memory, and motivation. When you find a sugary snack, eat it, and discover it tastes delicious, your brain releases dopamine, which helps lay down a context-dependent memory. Itâ€™s a signal that says, â€œRemember what youâ€™re eating and where you found it!â€ Dopamine also motivates you to repeat the process â€” to get up and go looking for that sugary snack again in the future.
When Kamphuis circulated his idea for a dopamine fast, it didnâ€™t seem to attract broad appeal. But this August, when Sepah published his guide and taught it to Silicon Valley execs, it took off. He used the term â€œdopamine fasting 2.0â€ to differentiate the modified protocol he created, which is a lot easier than Kamphuisâ€™s. It recommends that you abstain for a short period (as short as one hour per day) from whichever specific behavior has become problematic for you â€” whether itâ€™s gaming, gambling, scrolling through social media, or something else.
Now, however, he says his protocol has been misinterpreted. People like Sinka, the eye-contact-avoider, are engaged in â€œtheir own extremist practice,â€ Sepah told me, â€œwhich is completely incompatible with my protocol.â€
Sepah thinks the media â€” which he says likes to mock â€œSilicon Valley male excessâ€ â€” is partly to blame for the misunderstanding. In a blog post, he wrote that the Times was wrong to claim that â€œdopamine fasting is basically a fast of everything,â€ and that his original guide makes clear what dopamine fasting is not: an avoidance of dopamine or of anything stimulating.
Itâ€™s true that the guide does not advocate fasting from social contact â€” in fact, it actually recommends that people talk and bond with others while theyâ€™re dopamine fasting. Yet itâ€™s not surprising that some in Silicon Valley have interpreted the gospel of dopamine fasting in this way. If you donâ€™t want people to interpret a practice as an avoidance of dopamine, itâ€™s probably best not to call it dopamine fasting.
â€œDopamine is just a mechanism that explains how addictions can become reinforced, and makes for a catchy title,â€ Sepah told the Times. â€œThe titleâ€™s not to be taken literally.â€
But of course, once a practice makes the rounds â€” which it will, precisely because itâ€™s been given a catchy title â€” people will make of it what they will. (Itâ€™s also worth noting the irony here: The title refers to a practice designed to undercut the attention economy, yet the very name was used because it grabs your attention.)
Whatâ€™s the scientific evidence in support of dopamine fasting?
Some people have interpreted dopamine fasting as being about, well, reducing dopamine. But if thatâ€™s your goal, youâ€™ve got a problem, because generally speaking dopamine is not under our control.
Dopamine floods your system when you experience unanticipated things â€” finding chocolate where you didnâ€™t expect to find any, for example. But if something becomes expected (thereâ€™s always chocolate in your office snack room at noon), then dopamine starts firing in anticipation of getting that reward. So, can somebody really fast from dopamine?
â€œWell, if theyâ€™re anticipating anything â€” like eating chocolate or having a conversation â€” thatâ€™s not something you typically have conscious control over,â€ Judson Brewer, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Brown University who specializes in addiction, told me. â€œYou canâ€™t stop anticipating something. If you see chocolate, your brain thinks, â€˜Oh that looks good!â€™ You canâ€™t tell your brain, â€˜Hey, donâ€™t do that.â€™â€
Brewer laughed when he heard about the Silicon Valley start-up founders who are avoiding everything from eye contact to social interactions in an attempt to avoid dopamine. â€œThatâ€™s hilarious!â€ he said. â€œLeave it to people to take everything to an extreme and not understand how their own brains work.â€
But to be fair, we should distinguish this extreme interpretation from the goal Sepah actually proposed â€” which is not, despite the unnecessarily confusing name, to reduce dopamine.
â€œThe point of dopamine fasting is to increase behavioral flexibility, by reducing impulsive behavior for extended periods of time,â€ Sepah told me in an email. â€œBy both avoiding conditioned stimuli (e.g. notifications) that trigger impulsive behavior, and also naturally exposing ourselves to unconditioned stimuli (e.g. negative feelings of anxiety, boredom, or loneliness) but not giving into a conditioned response (e.g. grabbing for our phones, or eating a sugary snack), this helps weaken that conditioning over time.â€
Basically, by avoiding stimuli like smartphone notifications and also exposing ourselves to uncomfortable feelings without giving in to the temptation to distract ourselves, we can break our habit of grabbing our devices anytime they ding or we feel bad.
This is classic behaviorism, and itâ€™s perfectly fine, as far as it goes. The idea that we should practice exposing ourselves to anxious, bored, or lonely feelings without resorting to our usual escape methods, like checking our phones, is one youâ€™ll find in countless CBT-based guides to distress tolerance nowadays.
Brewer said he doesnâ€™t question whether Sepahâ€™s proposal is accurately classified as CBT (it is) or whether Sepah is right to say that if we donâ€™t take breaks from overstimulating technologies, weâ€™ll seek out ever-higher doses of stimulation (thatâ€™s basic habituation). However, he does question dopamine fasting as a strategy for the long haul.
â€œYou can force yourself to fast, but thatâ€™s not actually going to be useful in the long term,â€ Brewer said. His reasoning: If you fast one day a week for the rest of your life, thatâ€™s just going to deprive you of whatever you like. But because you still like it, youâ€™re going to keep coming back to it.
Itâ€™s much better, Brewer says, to teach your brain that a given activity â€” like scrolling through social media for hours on end â€” is not actually very rewarding. When you realize that a behavior leaves you feeling bad, it becomes much easier to moderate it. You no longer need to force yourself to abstain; instead, abstaining is a natural byproduct of your distaste.
Sounds nice, but how do you achieve that? The answer, Brewer said, is mindfulness. Through paying close attention to an experience in real time, you can teach your brain that the experience is not truly rewarding.
Brewerâ€™s lab has shown that app-based mindfulness training â€” which combines awareness of the present moment with an attitude of nonjudgmental curiosity â€” can help smokers and overeaters reduce their unhealthy habits by as much as 40 percent.
According to Brewer, if you want to short-circuit your drive to go after more and more dopamine, â€œYouâ€™ve got to give your brain a bigger, better offer.â€ That offer is curiosity, which feels better than a craving and is not dopamine-driven, so long as itâ€™s rooted in interest rather than deprivation (the I-need-to-find-out-right-now-or-Iâ€™m-going-to-die feeling). The best part, Brewer said, is that â€œintrinsically rewarding behaviors such as curiosity donâ€™t become habituated â€” you donâ€™t deplete curiosity.â€
Is dopamine fasting just repackaging old ideas?
A perennial frustration with Silicon Valley is that it tends to come up with â€œtrendsâ€ that it markets as innovative new discoveries when really theyâ€™re centuries-old practices. Case in point: In January, Dorsey tweeted about how he feels like time slows down when heâ€™s engaged in intermittent fasting and asked, â€œAnyone else have this experience?â€ It prompted a collective eyeroll from Muslims and others whoâ€™ve long fasted as part of their religious observance.
Now, some people are asking what differentiates dopamine fasting from preexisting practices â€” Buddhist meditation retreats, say, or the Jewish Sabbath, which involves abstaining from electronic devices for a day but also involves engaging in prosocial activity. For that matter, how different is dopamine fasting from commonsense ideas like simply taking a break, enjoying a weekend, or going on vacation?
Very different, according to Sepah.
â€œMeditation/silent retreats involve practicing mindfulness and sometimes not speaking. Dopamine fasting involves neither,â€ he told me. â€œSabbath is focused on not working in favor of religious worship. You can absolutely work during a dopamine fast if itâ€™s values-aligned and is not a religious practice. Vacations are often treated as opportunities for unbridled hedonism and actually doing more bad habits, so itâ€™s almost the opposite of dopamine fasting.â€
Sepah argues that his recommended schedule for abstaining from gaming, gambling, or whichever behavior is problematic for you also makes dopamine fasting unique. Hereâ€™s what he prescribes:
1-4 hours at the end of the day (depending on work & family demands)
1 weekend day (spend it outside on a Saturday or Sunday)
1 weekend per quarter (go on a local trip)
1 week per year (go on vacation!)
This sounds a lot like common sense; some of us do this already. But Sepahâ€™s point is not just that we should take a vacation but that what we do while weâ€™re on vacation matters. The vacation is just the vessel; dopamine fasting is what you fill it with. â€œI recommended dopamine fasting be done during nights, weekends, and vacation periods because thatâ€™s realistically when people have time to practice,â€ he told me.
Fair enough. It probably would be good for our health if we were more intentional about how we spend our limited free time, using it as a chance to practice things that modern life has made us extra uncomfortable with â€” like being alone or being bored â€” by offering us ubiquitous, immediate escapes in the form of digital devices.
Thereâ€™s nothing objectionable about this recommendation per se. The problem has more to do with the name of the practice, which practically begs to be misconstrued, and with the claim that the practice represents an ideal long-term strategy. Although Sepah says heâ€™s created â€œthe antidote to our overstimulated age,â€ in reality he seems to have created something more like a stopgap measure, one prone to being misinterpreted in harshly ascetic ways.

"Another cloud of choking smoke and dust is set to descend upon the 20 million residents of Delhi this week, with forecasters warning that air pollution is likely to reach â€œsevereâ€ or â€œemergencyâ€ levels on Wednesday. The dangerous, dirty air is arising from a mix of weather conditions, urban emissions, and rural smoke converging over Indiaâ€™s capital region.
Itâ€™s the latest wave of severe air pollution in recent weeks. Delhiâ€™s Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal turned to Twitter last month to describe his city as a â€œgas chamber.â€
The gray haze led to canceled flights, closed schools, and created a public health emergency. The government distributed 5 million face masks to schoolchildren.
Last week, some air quality index monitors maxed out with ratings of 999 and pollution reached 50 times the level deemed safe by the World Health Organization. For Delhiites, breathing the air was like smoking 50 cigarettes in a day. The US Embassy in New Delhi maintains its own air quality monitor and reported Wednesday that the air quality index reached 408, earning a rating of â€œhazardous.â€

This surge in air pollution in Delhi is an alarmingly regular occurrence, and itâ€™s part of a dangerous pollution problem in India. The World Health Organization reported last year that 11 of the 12 cities in the world with the most pollution from PM2.5 â€” particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter that can cause dangerous heart troubles and breathing problems â€” were in India. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health found that in 2015, there were 9 million premature deaths stemming from air pollution around the world. India suffered the worst toll of any country, with more than 2.5 million of these deaths. Pollution has also shaved 3.2 years from the life expectancies of 660 million people in the country, according to one estimate.
While the very young, the elderly, and the infirm are most at risk, when pollution gets high enough, everyone can suffer. The effects can last for years, even from prenatal exposure. With a growing population throughout the country and more people moving to densely packed cities, the risk is worsening for Indians.
The dirty air is a consequence of both natural and human factors, and many emerging economies around the world are facing similar problems as societies urbanize and shift from agrarian to industrial. But air pollution is a problem with roots in politics, and in Delhi, much of the pollution can be traced to distinct policy decisions, including the unintended consequences of a water conservation law. The solution, then, lies not just in technology, but in better governance.
Why Delhiâ€™s air pollution gets so bad this time of year
Joshua Apte, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of Texas Austin, explained that air quality is a function of pollution and dilution: how much is emitted and how much it spreads out. And right now in Delhi, thereâ€™s a lot of the former and not much of the latter.
In November, the air over Delhi gets cool, dry, and still. That ends up trapping much of the air over the city and limits its dispersal. The area is also landlocked and surrounding topology can act as a basin.
Then there are the pollution sources. Some of the biggest emitters are Delhiâ€™s more than 10 million vehicles, like cars and trucks. Many of these vehicles run on two-stroke engines that produce more air pollution than four-stroke motors. Depending on the time of year, vehicles can contribute 40 to 80 percent of the regionâ€™s total pollution. Dust from the cityâ€™s construction boom is also a contributor to the cityâ€™s smog. Brick kilns that burn solid fuels are another factor. So is coal-fired power generation.
These sources contribute to Delhiâ€™s year-round pollution. But there are several additional factors making air quality even worse now.
As temperatures drop, some of the poorer residents of the city are burning fires for cooking and heating, sending dust and ash into urban environs.
Some of the worst pollution this year also occurred during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, celebrated by lighting lamps, and often, by setting off fireworks. The celebration, which typically runs five days, began on October 27 this year.
However, one of the largest sources of Delhiâ€™s pollution right now isnâ€™t coming from the city itself. Rather, farmers outside of the city this time of year burn crop stubble left over from the harvest to clear their fields and restore nutrients to the soil for their next planting. The smoke from these fires has wafted over the city in recent days.
Added together, it has become a recipe for choking, dirty air for millions of residents. â€œItâ€™s like youâ€™re pouring a whole lot of stuff off into a sink thatâ€™s plugged up,â€ Apte said. â€œIt overflows with spectacular consequences.â€
Delhiâ€™s air wasnâ€™t always so bad. A water conservation law helped fuel the rise in pollution.
â€œIâ€™m actually a Delhiite, and I was born and raised in Delhi, and I never experienced this pollution,â€ said Aseem Prakash, founding director of the Center for Environmental Politics at the University of Washington. â€œThe [severe] pollution has started really in 2010. The question is what happened in 2009?â€
Prakash explained that the Punjab province west and upwind of Delhi is Indiaâ€™s breadbasket, and improvements in farming techniques in recent years in this region helped deliver a food surplus to the country.

However, these intensive farming techniques started to fuel a water shortage as farmers using cheap electricity overdrew from groundwater reserves. To combat this, the Punjab government in 2009 enacted the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act.
One of the key provisions of this law changed how farmers plant rice. Rice production typically takes place in two stages, where the crop is first cultivated in a nursery before being transplanted to a paddy. The water act prohibited nursery sowing before May 10 and transplanting before June 10. The delay allowed for seasonal monsoon rains to arrive and replenish aquifers.
By most accounts, the law worked. It slowed the decline of Punjabâ€™s water table. But delaying planting means delaying the harvest. With a late October rice harvest, farmers now have barely a month to clear their fields for winter wheat, which is typically sown mid-November.
These farms are often run by small-scale farmers that canâ€™t hire a large number of workers or afford the machinery needed to rapidly clear their fields of the leftovers from the last harvest. So they turned to the cheapest and quickest method to prepare for the next planting â€” burning crop stubble.

Of course, itâ€™s not just rural pollution thatâ€™s choking Delhi. The urban sources of pollution â€” traffic, construction, cooking fires â€” have also increased as the regionâ€™s population has boomed by more than 7 million people in the past decade, leading to unchecked sprawl.
Together, these factors combined to cause a sudden devastating decline in air quality in Delhi in recent years.
Delhi officials are responding to the air pollution, but they are reluctant to take aggressive action
This year, officials in Delhi banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, arresting 210 people and confiscating 3.7 metric tons of illicit incendiaries. But pops and explosions still rattled the city throughout the festival.
Brick kilns and factories have also been shut down this week. Delhi officials also implemented an odd-even traffic rationing scheme that takes about half of the cars off the road on a given day based on their license plate numbers. Roughly 200 teams of traffic police were deployed to enforce the rules. However, the scheme barely made a dent in the amount of pollution.
Indiaâ€™s Supreme Court on Monday also issued an injunction against crop burning. Yet fires have continued, showing that enforcement is a problem, and farmers are still in the early days of the crop stubble-burning season.
Added together, these stopgap measures have barely moved the needle. While air quality in Delhi has improved somewhat in recent days, analysts say itâ€™s because of shifts in the weather â€” not policy.
â€œThis is mainly due to the change in wind direction from north-westerly to south-easterly, which allowed Delhiâ€™s air to slightly improve,â€ Kurinji Selvaraj, a research analyst at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank told CBS News.

Getting more meaningful reductions in pollution means tackling all of the sources at the same time, which has proven to be an enormous hurdle. â€œPart of the challenge is that thereâ€™s a character of â€˜Oh no, you first,â€™ â€˜No, you first,â€™â€ Apte said. â€œNo one sector wants to sign up for regulations that would lead to sharp cuts in their emissions when other sectors are not necessarily sharing equal portions of the blame.â€
Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that every source of pollution is also a political constituency: farmers, landowners, property developers, construction firms, energy companies. In a democracy like India, they all have a seat at the loud, raucous table. There are also societal fault lines amid the pollution â€” many of the farmers in Punjab belong to the Sikh religious minority and politicians are worried that pressuring them could reopen old sectarian wounds.
Despite the growing alarm, air pollution scarcely came up during Indiaâ€™s last election cycle. And while Indian officials and courts are issuing edicts to stop sources of pollution, they are reluctant to enforce bans on burning, driving, fireworks, and industrial activity.
â€œPeople will be up in revolt, theyâ€™ll stop trains, there will be riots, and nobody wants to get into this hassle,â€ Prakash said. â€œItâ€™s actually a very, very noisy and well-functioning democracy, and there are too many veto points.â€
Air pollution can be solved. Some cities have made great progress.
Many cities around the world struggle with air pollution. London famously has been fighting dirty air since the 14th century and continues to suffer air quality problems today. Paris has also historically and recently suffered from dangerous smog.
In the United States, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County regularly face air quality alerts when wildfires spark around them. And the country as a whole has experienced a spike in deaths stemming from air pollution due in part to weaker enforcement of environmental laws.
But the air quality problems in these cities are often transient, and many have made important progress in consistently improving air quality by enforcing environmental regulations, as well as deploying cleaner technology. The persistent dirty air over Delhi is a consequence of its current stage of economic development, similar to other megacities in developing countries.
This is the idea behind the Environmental Kuznets Curve. Named for economist Simon Kuznets, the hypothesis is that pollution in a country is low when it is impoverished. As incomes rise, the amount of pollution produced increases, but beyond a certain threshold of income, the pollution decreases again as pollution control technologies are deployed and governance structures are implemented. The highest pollution levels occur at the transition from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy, when the city or a country is getting the worst of both worlds.
The Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesizes that as a country develops, pollution gets worse before it gets better. Ecological Economics
But Delhi and cities like it are not doomed to follow this curve, Prakash said. Chinese cities like Beijing have managed to dramatically improve their air quality while still having moderate per capita incomes. A big reason that Chinaâ€™s air has cleared up, though, is that it has a more authoritarian government, so when Chinese officials give the order to shut down factories and limit traffic ahead of major events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it gets done. The government has since drastically reduced the amount of industrial and agricultural activity around the city.
â€œThe beauty of China is that if they want something to be done, they can do it,â€ Prakash said. â€œNothing stands between the decision and the implementation.â€
Thatâ€™s not the case with India, so reducing pollution takes more finesse. To clear the air over Delhi, Prakash said the government could issue subsidies and incentives for farmers to use less polluting land management tactics, helping them buy or rent machinery as well as paying them extra for their harvest if they pull it off without burning crop stubble.
India also has a law mandating that 2 percent of corporate profits go toward charity. Prakash said some of those funds could be earmarked to help farmers and reduce pollution.
Within Delhi, pollution reductions will have to come from switching to cleaner energy. â€œIf one steps back and says, what is the largest contributor to pollution, the single largest contributor is fossil fuels,â€ Prakash said. Itâ€™s not just coal in power plants, but gasoline and diesel combustion in cars and trucks.

That means reducing urban air pollution by deploying vastly more renewable energy and clean transportation. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged that his country would more than double its renewable energy production, going from 175 gigawatts to 450 gigawatts by 2022. However, Modi did not commit to any reductions in fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.
It shows that despite all the known harms of air pollution, the pressure for economic development remains immense, and many public officials are willing to accept the tradeoffs.
While some of the solutions like wind and solar power are already being used, a region like Delhi demands deployment on a gargantuan scale in order to make a difference to its environment. That will take a huge amount of time, money, and foresight. The lessons learned in Delhi could also guide other growing metropolises facing air quality concerns like Karachi, Pakistan, and Lagos, Nigeria. â€œThe problem can be solved,â€ Prakash said. â€œBut what you need is political will and a bit of imagination.â€"
"Thereâ€™s a surprisingly big disconnect between how obesity researchers think about the causes of and treatments for obesity and how the American public does.
Researchers think some people have genetic and hormonal traits that make them more susceptible to obesity. They view obesity as a complex, chronic disease, like cancer, with many causes and subtypes. Theyâ€™re also losing faith in dieting and exercise, neither of which is very helpful for weight loss in the long term.
The public, on the other hand, generally believes obesity is caused by a lack of willpower, and that it can be fixed with gym memberships and trendy diets. In one 2016 survey of more than 1,500 Americans, 60 percent of the participants said dieting and exercise were even more effective than surgery for long-term weight loss.
Hereâ€™s the thing, though: Weight loss surgery is far and away medicineâ€™s best treatment for severe obesity.

Jewelâ€™s journey: when everything else failed, this teen turned to weight loss surgery
The medical case for bariatric surgery has grown much stronger in recent years. High quality studies on the long-term health outcomes of people with obesity who got surgery show, on average, that theyâ€™re able to lose dramatic amounts of weight, and even reverse or prevent their obesity-related health conditions, like diabetes and high cholesterol. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated this once again. Thatâ€™s why Medicaid now covers the procedure in 46 states, and so do national health systems in countries like Israel, Brazil, and Canada. Itâ€™s also why the American Academy of Pediatrics is now endorsing the operation as a â€œsafe and effectiveâ€ option for adolescents with severe obesity.
Yet out of the 20 million people who are eligible in the US, fewer than 1 percent get bariatric surgery for weight loss, according to the Obesity Society.
Why? Polling data shows that many Americans still think itâ€™s dangerous and ineffective.
To be clear, not all weight loss surgeries are created equal: The gastric bypass and gastric sleeve operations are considered superior to the lap band, for example. And surgery isnâ€™t for people with a few pounds to lose; itâ€™s reserved for those with severe obesity. Even the best surgeries donâ€™t work in some people and can cause disturbing side effects in rare cases. But bariatric surgeryâ€™s benefits appear to vastly outweigh its harms on average, and it is shaping up to be a genuine help for people struggling through one of the most urgent health crises of our time. Itâ€™s time we started paying attention.
Weight loss surgeries work by reducing the size of the stomach and suppressing hormones related to hunger and satiety
The obesity crisis in America really began to take off in the 1970s. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates from 2016 show that 40 percent of US adults and 19 percent of youth are obese.
But long before that, doctors were searching for ways to alter peopleâ€™s bodies to help them eat less food.
Jaw wiring, which involved literally wiring the jaws shut to stop people from eating, was among the early approaches. In the 1950s, researchers noticed that shortening the small intestines of dogs hampered their ability to absorb calories and caused them to lose weight. By the late 1960s, bariatric surgery was being tried in humans. Surgeonsâ€™ methods were crude at first but have vastly improved over the years. And some kinds of bariatric surgery (most recently, the lap band approach) have fallen out of favor.
Now researchers are generating longer-term data showing some of the current surgical methods that can lead to dramatic and durable weight loss, and, even more remarkably, improvements in peopleâ€™s long-term health outcomes.

Itâ€™s easy to become obese in America. These 7 charts explain why.
The majority of bariatric procedures in America today involve the gastric sleeve and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Both of these methods permanently alter the digestive tract to help people lose an average of about 30 percent of their original bodyweight (and keep most of it off â€” more on that later).
With the sleeve, which now makes up more than 50 percent of weight loss surgeries in the US, surgeons staple off and remove about 80 percent of the stomach, transforming the organ from a wide football shape into a slim banana (or sleeve) shape. By reducing the size of the stomach, people canâ€™t eat as much as they used to, so they consume fewer calories.
With the gastric bypass, surgeons use staples to make the stomach smaller by creating a small pouch, which can only hold about an ounce (or walnutâ€™s worth) of food. Next, they reconnect the small intestine to a hole in the new pouch, so food flows into the pouch, bypassing most of the stomach, and then into the latter part of the small intestine, bypassing the first half of the intestine. Like the sleeve, the surgery also restricts the amount of food people can eat, but because food no longer passes through most of the stomach, people also canâ€™t absorb as many calories and nutrients as they used to.
But an additional reason both the sleeve and gastric bypass surgeries lead to long-term weight loss is likely because of the changes in hormones that occur after these procedures. The sleeve, and especially the bypass, seems to suppress hormones that affect hunger and satiety, like the â€œhunger hormoneâ€ ghrelin â€” something no diet will ever do.
Surgery may also reset the bodyâ€™s metabolism
Another interesting possible reason for why the surgery works is that it may readjust the bodyâ€™s metabolic rate, making maintaining weight loss easier.
In a 2014 study, published in the journal Obesity, researchers compared participants from the Biggest Loser reality TV show who had gone on crash diets and exercise programs to rapidly lose as much weight as possible to people who had gastric bypass surgery. (They jumped on the chance to study reality show contestants because itâ€™s so rare to see people with severe obesity lose vast amounts of weight in real life.) The bypass surgery patients saw their metabolisms normalize within a year, to a rate that matched their new body size, while the TV show contestants saw their metabolisms slow down and stay that way â€” even six years after losing the weight and, on average, regaining much of it back.
Researchers suspect this is because surgery may reset the â€œset point,â€ or the bodyâ€™s habit of vigorously defending a certain weight range. Once a person gains weight and keeps that weight on for a period of time, the body gets used to its new, larger size. When a person loses weight, a bunch of subtle changes kick in â€” to the hormone levels, the brain â€” increasing appetite and slowing the metabolism, all in a seeming conspiracy to get back up to that set point weight.
Amazingly, surgery seems to lower the set point, and even weaken the bodyâ€™s desire to defend it. And that seems to make keeping weight off a little easier.
Not all weight loss surgeries are equally effective. The lap band surgery is not a great weight loss surgery.
The third most common weight loss procedure in America is the lap band, though it has dramatically fallen out of favor in recent years and now only makes up about 5 percent of surgeries. The problem is the surgery doesnâ€™t work as well for weight loss as the other procedures on offer, and it leads to many complications and more surgery.
Lap banding involves placing an inflatable band around the upper portion of the stomach to create a small pouch. When the lap band operation was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, it seemed like a safe option for weight loss surgery that could be adjusted or removed at the patientâ€™s behest. (Unlike the gastric bypass or sleeve operations, it didnâ€™t involve permanently altering the stomach or intestines â€” and it could be reversed by simply removing the device.)
But long-term data suggest lap band patients lose about half the amount of weight as bypass or sleeve patients. To be clear, even losing 10 percent of oneâ€™s bodyweight (the average weight loss with lap banding) can improve health outcomes, but itâ€™s a lot less than the other weight loss surgeries. The lap band also turned out to be riskier than it seemed at first, often requiring additional surgeries.
In the best study we have on just how problematic lap band surgeries can be, published in JAMA, researchers from the University of Michigan looked at 16 years of Medicare data to see how common â€œre-operationsâ€ were after the first lap band procedure. These involved everything from removing the band to replacing it, fixing it, or following the initial procedure with another weight loss operation (i.e., the gastric bypass). They found 20 percent â€” or one in five â€” of the 25,000 lap band patients needed an additional procedure. Thatâ€™s much higher than the 3 to 9 percent re-operation rate for the gastric bypass and gastric sleeve surgeries.
Researchers think one reason the lap bands can fail is that they only restrict the size of the stomach, without producing the hormone and metabolic changes the sleeve and bypass do.
People who get bypass or sleeve operations lose about a third of their original bodyweight on average â€” and keep most of it off
In the longer-term studies of both teens and adults who got sleeve and bypass surgeries, researchers found that people lose about a third of their original bodyweight on average and keep most of it off. So if someone weighs 300 pounds going into surgery, after a year theyâ€™ll probably weigh about 200. But not all surgeries are created equal: The lap band is dramatically less effective than the sleeve or bypass. Letâ€™s look at the evidence.
According to a recent study, published in JAMA Surgery, researchers followed more than 1,000 adults for up to seven years and found bypass patients lost 28 percent of their original bodyweight (including regaining about 4 percent of their weight loss between three and seven years). Band patients lost only 15 percent of their original bodyweight after seven years.
In another 2016 JAMA study, looking at the four-year weight change in veterans who underwent weight loss surgery, the bypass patients lost 27 percent of their original bodyweight, the gastric sleeve patients lost 17 percent, and again, lap band patients lost 10 percent.
Another systematic review from 2015 pooled the results of many studies on different weight loss operations and found the same trend: Band patients fared the worst when it came to weight loss, and gastric bypass patients the best.
The data on adolescents who get bariatric surgery looks similar. In a 2016 New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers followed 242 adolescents who got either gastric bypass surgery or the sleeve. After three years, sleeve patients lost 26 percent of their original bodyweight while bypass patients lost 28 percent. For a 2019 paper, also in NEJM, researchers compared the health outcomes of 161 teens and 396 adults for five years after their gastric bypass surgeries. Both groups lost around a third of their original bodyweight.
Another 2017 Lancet study followed 58 American teens for eight years who underwent gastric bypass. Again, teens lost an average of 30 percent of their bodyweight. Thatâ€™s a similar finding to a study out of Sweden which tracked 81 teenagers with obesity who had a gastric bypass for five years. They lost about 28 percent of their original bodyweight.
So the data we have now suggests the surgery can be both safe and effective on average. But thereâ€™s still more researchers need to learn about the current surgical methods being used, in particular, their very long-term effects on people after more than a decade or two, and whether surgery continues to mitigate the effects of obesityâ€™s toll.
Thereâ€™s some variation in how much weight people lose after surgery, and no one knows why
As with every health intervention, there are some big caveats with weight loss surgery, too. One is that thereâ€™s some real variability in how people respond to it, and researchers have no way of predicting who will fare well and who wonâ€™t.
This 2018 JAMA Surgery study is a great example. The average weight loss after bypass was about 30 percent, and the majority of the study participants had lost and kept off between 20 and 30 percent of their bodyweight seven years after a bypass surgery. But there were outliers: 5 percent of the participants in the study lost as little as 10 percent of their original bodyweight, while 13 percent lost as much as 45 percent of their original weight.
While researchers canâ€™t tell who will succeed and who will fail before a surgery, they are learning people who do well have a few things in common. In the paper, the researchers found that people who lost more weight tended to be younger when they got the surgery. They also tended to be female and white, and had a higher body mass at the start of the study.
In another 2016 paper, looking at the variables that affected weight change after surgery, researchers found that people who adopted healthier eating habits lost the most weight. So it wasnâ€™t just the surgery that helped people; it was changes to their diet, too.
â€œEveryone is quite different in terms of how they lose weight and how much they lose over time,â€ said Anita Courcoulas, a bariatric surgeon who was an author on both of these papers.
She thinks the reason is that thereâ€™s variability in the causes and subtypes of obesity among people, and that different people may need to be treated differently to get the best results. â€œI think the important next step is figuring out how to understand the different subtypes of obesity,â€ she said, â€œinstead of treating people like theyâ€™re one homogenous group.â€ But weâ€™re not there yet.
The other health benefits of surgery can be dramatic, including driving Type 2 diabetes into remission
Aside from the weight loss, the reason doctors get excited about bariatric surgery is that it seems to reduce the risk of a bunch of obesity-related diseases.
Compared to obese adults who donâ€™t get the surgery, bariatric patients live longer, have a lower risk of cancer, have less high blood pressure, have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes, and weigh significantly less.
The JAMA Surgery study offers some of the best evidence that these effects are durable over time. The study came out of LABS, the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery, a rigorous, multi-center study of bariatric patients thatâ€™s funded by the National Institutes of Health. Many bariatric studies have issues with people dropping out over time, which may bias the results. But the LABS researchers were able to follow up with more than 80 percent of the participants over seven years, which is rare in clinical medicine.
And they found that all of the patientsâ€™ health conditions â€” diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol â€” were less prevalent seven years after surgery than they were before surgery. Sixty percent of the patients with Type 2 diabetes going in were still in remission seven years later. (The same wasnâ€™t true for the group that got the lap band.)
The newest NEJM study suggests teens may see these benefits even more: They were much more likely to experience remission of their diabetes and high blood pressure than adults.
Surgery can cause complications and carry rare but disturbing side effects
Todayâ€™s weight loss surgical techniques are a lot safer than they used to be â€” thereâ€™s a low rate of complications thatâ€™s similar to other abdominal operations, like gallbladder surgery. But the operations still carry a 0.3 percent mortality risk and other potential harms.
The most common long-term issue bariatric surgery patients face is nutritional deficiencies. Surgeries can hamper the bodyâ€™s ability to absorb nutrients, so many of the people go on to develop iron, B12, calcium, folate, and thiamine deficiencies. Thatâ€™s why bariatric patients need to be closely monitored for the rest of their lives, to make sure theyâ€™re getting the vitamins they need and that theyâ€™re not developing any other health issues as a result.
Many patients also need additional surgeries for surgical complications, or â€œrevisionâ€ operations to address problems with their original surgeries. For example, patients who got the lap band may go back for a bypass after finding out the lap band didnâ€™t work. And between 6 and 20 percent of bypass patients need to get treatment for stomal stenosis, which is when the new connection between the small stomach pouch and the intestine narrows and doctors have to go back in a stretch it out.
The sleeve is a simpler procedure and there tend to be fewer complications requiring surgery, but they can still happen. Up to 5 percent of sleeve patients experience gastric leaks, or a hole along the staple line of the newly created stomach, which allows stomach juices to leak into the abdominal cavity. Up to 17 percent of adults who have undergone a sleeve operation are later diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of acid reflux disease that can lead to cancer.
Finally, some patients may opt for plastic surgery for loose, hanging skin â€” extra procedures that often arenâ€™t covered by insurance.
Then there are the rare but disturbing psychological effects that have surfaced in adults after bariatric surgery, including a slightly elevated post-surgical risk of self-harm, suicide, and drug and alcohol use disorders.
Researchers still donâ€™t understand why this happens, but they have some ideas theyâ€™re exploring. Because of the changes in the gut after bypass and sleeve operations, patients are more sensitive to the effects of drugs and alcohol.
â€œAny drug that peaks more quickly is more prone to abuse,â€ said James Mitchell, a psychiatrist who studies bariatric surgery at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences. So itâ€™s possible that bariatric surgery may make alcohol and other drugs more addicting for some people.
Junaid Bhatti, a Toronto-based researcher who has studied the link between suicide and bariatric surgery, said researchers are exploring whether this increased risk is caused by stress after surgery â€” the pressure to lose weight, the disappointment if you donâ€™t. â€œThere is a subgroup of patients that may not be able to adjust well to the restrictions that come after surgery and if they have any previous mental health issue that may be provoked because of that stress following surgery,â€ he explained. Or maybe thereâ€™s some other yet-to-be-discovered physiological change after surgery that explains it.
These two effects â€” the drug abuse and mental health issues â€” may work together in dangerous ways, Mitchell added. â€œWhen people are intoxicated, they are disinhibited. If they are depressed and thinking about suicide, thatâ€™s not an uncommon time for them to act. So those two things may converge in a bad way that needs to be looked at in more detail.â€
Thereâ€™s another nonmedical â€” but important â€” side effect of going under the knife for weight loss surgery: experiencing a change in relationship status. A study out of Sweden, published in JAMA Surgery, found people with spouses or live-in partners were more likely to separate or divorce after surgery compared to control groups who didnâ€™t get surgery, while single patients were more likely to get into a relationship.
The new NEJM paper found these serious complications â€” nutrient deficiencies, self-harm, additional operations â€” may be more common in teens than adults. So thereâ€™s an urgent need to understand them.
Bariatric surgery isnâ€™t necessarily cost-saving. But itâ€™s cost-effective.
Then there are the important cost considerations. Without insurance, bariatric surgery can cost more than $20,000. And that doesnâ€™t include the cost of additional operations and follow-up care. So bariatric surgery isnâ€™t necessarily going to make a big dent in Americaâ€™s obesity-related costs, which add up to about $210 billion per year.
â€œThe expectation is bariatric erases these obesity-associated costs,â€ said David Arterburn, an obesity expert at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, â€œbut because of the small complication rate and because complications are expensive â€” requiring hospitalization, reoperation â€” my take on the literature is that thereâ€™s no cost savings that happens from bariatric surgery.â€
The average patient with severe obesity uses between $5,000 and $10,000 in medical care per year, he said. Out of those total costs, about a third are associated with their obesity. The rest is related to other problems, like arthritis or high blood pressure thatâ€™s brought on by aging. Bariatric surgery can help cut the obesity-related costs, but not necessarily these other costs or the follow-up.
Even so, bariatric surgery is considered â€œcost-effective,â€ meaning itâ€™s as effective or better than similarly expensive interventions.
â€œCost-effective treatments are considered somewhere between less than $50,000 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved [QALY],â€ explained Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness and a professor at George Washington University. â€œBariatric surgery is in the range of $50,000 per QALY.â€ By comparison, annual Pap smear screenings are estimated at $800,000 per QALY, kidney dialysis $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY, and spinal fusion $250,000 per QALY.
â€œThis is right in that sweet spot of we are spending a reasonable amount of money and getting a reasonable return,â€ Kahan added.
Researchers think the surgery could be even more cost-effective in adolescents â€” not only because theyâ€™ll likely experience greater health gains than adults (since theyâ€™re young and many of their health problems are more reversible), but also because theyâ€™ll be better positioned to contribute to the economy if theyâ€™re unencumbered by severe obesity.
People who want surgeries arenâ€™t always able to get them
Again, fewer than 1 percent of people get bariatric surgery for weight loss. And researchers and obesity experts think there are several reasons for that.
A lack of understanding about obesity and obesity-related stigma may hold both doctors and patients back from considering surgery. â€œThereâ€™s an attitude that people are at fault for their obesity, that itâ€™s failure or personal responsibility,â€ said Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, a membership organization for people with obesity. â€œNot only is having obesity something youâ€™re stigmatized for but if you need a medical intervention, thereâ€™s a stigma around needing help to deal with it.â€ So doctors may think patients can exercise their way out of the problem, and patients may feel they should be able to, too.
In a seminal 1991 study, researchers asked patients who had lost about 100 pounds after surgery to choose between regaining their weight or maintaining their new body size at the cost of living with another disability. The patients opted for deafness, blindness, heart disease, even losing a limb, instead of returning to their morbid obesity.
Insurance coverage is â€œall over the place,â€ Kahan said. Though many providers cover the surgery, copays can be high, and insurers often donâ€™t pay for follow-up operations or plastic surgeries that are needed later. â€œEven when there is coverage, itâ€™s quasi-coverage,â€ he added. â€œCopays can range from hundreds of dollars to over $10,000 in some policies. For some patients, surgeries are exempt from out-of-pocket maximums.â€
Many doctors still donâ€™t know the basic requirements for bariatric surgery recommendation and may not be referring patients who could benefit from surgery, he added. In a 2007 survey of nearly 500 doctors, 91 percent referred their severely obese patients to exercise, with diet following closely behind. The least recommended weight loss treatment was bariatric surgery, prescribed for only 15 of the doctorsâ€™ morbidly obese patients.
We canâ€™t cut our way out of the obesity epidemic
Almost all the researchers I spoke to for this story said they hoped to one day find a pill that could do for obesity what surgery does. But until then, surgery is the best thing we have for the treatment of obesity. That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s the answer to the obesity epidemic, however.
Javier Zarracina/Vox
â€œThe obesity epidemic did not occur because we donâ€™t have enough surgery,â€ said National Institutes of Health obesity researcher Kevin Hall. â€œThe obesity epidemic occurred because the food environment has changed remarkably.â€
Thereâ€™s no question that our food landscape has increased the opportunities for obesity-related genes and traits to express themselves. Preventing future obesity cases will require making it easier for people to eat healthfully and be more active. But thereâ€™s still the problem about what to do for the people who are struggling with severe obesity right now.
â€œ[Surgery] is an incredibly valuable tool right now for treating adults with [severe] obesity,â€ Hall added, â€œbut weâ€™re not going to cut our way out of the obesity epidemic.â€"
"Amazonâ€™s best seller lists arguably provide a better snapshot into consumersâ€™ psyches and raging pop culture trends than any analyst, trend forecaster, or influencer ever could. Theyâ€™re updated hourly, providing a real-time, fascinating look into what lots of people are buying.
At the time of this writing, five of the top 100 best sellers on Amazonâ€™s beauty and personal care best seller list are acne patches. There are hundreds of thousands of beauty products, so one single product type taking up 5 percent of the largest internet retailerâ€™s best sellers seems significant. There are pages and pages of them for sale on the site.
Google backs up shoppersâ€™ interest in this category, with searches for â€œpimple patchesâ€ spiking in the past year. Retailers at all price points, from Target to Neiman Marcus, carry them now. Proponents evangelize them, even though their utility is actually pretty limited in many types of acne. They are exactly what you might guess: bandages â€” sometimes medicated, sometimes not â€” that you apply directly to pimples to make them go away. Some are meant to be as unobtrusive as possible, while the newest iterations come in impossible-to-ignore cute shapes and colors.

More than 50 million people a year deal with acne, according to the American Academy of Dermatology, and it affects people from puberty to beyond perimenopause. Living with acne can be stressful, and multiple studies have demonstrated the negative effect it has on self-esteem. Itâ€™s very difficult to treat, usually requiring different types of therapies and often a doctorâ€™s visit and prescription medications. So itâ€™s no surprise that consumers have always sought out quick, easy, and inexpensive ways to treat breakouts in a pinch. Savvy marketers are happy to provide options.
â€œWhen it comes to acne and skin care, everyone wants a seat at this table now because itâ€™s such a lucrative table to be sitting at. If thereâ€™s a place for someone to shove in a new product for skin care, theyâ€™re going to do it,â€ says Dr. Rachel Nazarian, a dermatologist in New York City.
Every era has its trendy over-the-counter acne treatments, high on promise but ultimately unable to deliver long-term, permanent results. In the â€˜80s and â€˜90s it was Oxy10 and Stridex pads, medicated ointments and wipes that can help treat breakouts but are also incredibly drying. Then came that pink Mario Badescu drying lotion and the Proactiv system, hawked by celebrities like Justin Bieber and Britney Spears on late-night TV. Now we have pimple patches, which started becoming widely available in the US in 2015. This is the same time Dr. Sandra Lee, aka Dr. Pimple Popper, the dermatologist who attracts millions of people to videos of her extracting large amounts of goo from peopleâ€™s pores, started becoming popular. Pimple patches are the perfect tool for a generation that is not squeamish about what comes out of their zits.
Pimple patches are made of hydrocolloid, a squishy, plasticky material used in wound healing bandages in hospitals. Itâ€™s been around since the 1980s and first became popular in ostomy care. You may recognize hydrocolloid from those blister pads you can buy at drugstores. The material absorbs fluid from a wound, forming a gel that gets trapped in the bandage, turning the area of the bandage white.
Hydrocolloid can help speed healing by keeping the underlying area moist, a key tenet in wound-healing. â€œItâ€™s almost miraculous,â€ says Dr. Gary Brauner of the technology, the chief of dermatology at Englewood Health in New Jersey, though heâ€™s skeptical of it for long-term acne treatment.
Thatâ€™s because in order to work, hydrocolloid patches require an open, oozing lesion. Most acne, unless youâ€™ve picked or popped it, is not that. Brauner does concede that they could be helpful as a barrier to keep you from picking. Picking is something every dermatologist pretty much agrees is bad because it can cause scarring and infection.

Pimple patches wonâ€™t do anything for blackheads, deep cysts, or whiteheads that arenâ€™t oozing. And while they can help a lesion that youâ€™ve picked at heal more quickly, according to Nazarian, they do nothing to prevent acne. At best, they might work on a small percentage of pimples, temporarily. They do trap draining fluid in a satisfying white chunk in the patch.
â€œThese spot treatments should be worked into your regimen not as your primary form, but as your back up,â€ says Nazarian.
But that has not stopped the proliferation of brands, products, and enthusiastic reviews. As a flagrant picker, Iâ€™ve found that they speed healing time, flatten out blemishes to make it easier to apply makeup, and generally discourage more facial gouging. When I asked informally on Twitter for peopleâ€™s experiences, I got responses like â€œessentialâ€ and â€œcanâ€™t live without them!â€ though one person said â€œHATEâ€ and another responded, â€œThey do â€¦ nothing for me.â€
Acne patches are offered in shapes ranging from small, transparent circles to bright yellow stars and glittery flowers. The acne-specific patches became popular in the early part of this decade, first in Asia. They started hitting US shores in 2012, about the same time the Korean beauty (K-beauty) craze took off here. 3Mâ€™s Nexcare brand was popular in South Korean beauty stores and drugstores first. But CosRx, a Korean brand, is generally credited with introducing western consumers to the concept.
Charlotte Cho, the founder of K-beauty e-commerce site Sokoglam, was one of the first retailers outside of Amazon in the US to carry CosRXâ€™s patches. She recalls first being exposed to pimple patches when she worked in Seoul in the early 2010s as an expat, where she saw people wearing them out in public. The CosRX patches, which cost $5 for 24, have been the siteâ€™s bestseller for years. They were also number one on Amazonâ€™s beauty list for a chunk of time, before the onslaught of competitors and copycats.
Then the gooey hydrocolloid floodgates opened. Mighty Patch is one of the brands that found mainstream success, founded by entrepreneur Ju Rhyu in 2017. Rhyu, just like Cho, discovered the technology when she was living in South Korea.
â€œIn the US, at Walgreens youâ€™d find [these products] in the bandaid section. I had a hypothesis that if I take this product category and I position it as a beauty product, I think it could do really well.â€ She says the brand sold out on Amazon in three months after the launch. Mighty Patch, which comes in various shapes and thicknesses, is carried at a variety of retailers, including Target, Neiman Marcus, Goop, and Anthropologie.
In their original incarnations, these pimple patches arenâ€™t medicated, which means they donâ€™t cause the dryness, flaking, or local skin reactions common with a lot of topical medications. But there are newer versions that are soaked with ingredients like salicylic acid, tea tree oil, and niacinamide. Presumably, manufacturers hope that these will be more active on some of the types of acne lesions that plain hydrocolloid dressings canâ€™t address. Currently the best-selling and highest-rated patch on Amazon is from a company called Avarelle. They cost $8.50 for 40 and are treated with tea tree and calendula oil.

An Australian brand, whose product is the cheekily named Zit Sticka, takes this to an even more extreme level. Its hydrocolloid patches have protruding â€œmicrodartsâ€ made up of dried ingredients like salicylic acid and hyaluronic acid. The darts supposedly can pierce the skin and deliver these ingredients deeper into the pimple to help shrink them. (K-beauty brand Acropass was a precursor, calling itself â€œacne acupuncture.â€)
Nazarian remains mostly skeptical but says that in theory these products may be helpful. â€œIs it a miracle? No. Is it going deep, deep down to the source? No. Are they going to be superior to applying something simply topically? Yes, probably,â€ she says. Brauner warns that they could cause irritation.
The newest iteration of hydrocolloid acne patches is those that donâ€™t even pretend to hide what they are. Older brands are transparent and thin and meant to be as invisible as possible. But Squishâ€™s version looks like flowers with a jewel in the center, and the newly launched Starface sells bright yellow stars. These are offshoots of the skin positivity movement that has been bubbling up online over the last few years, though the message is a little muddy. Should we be proud of our acne? If so, why bother buying any treatment at all? Or should we just not be embarrassed about treating it publicly? Both, kind of.
â€œ[Starface] de-stigmatizes and distracts and makes having a pimple fun,â€ says Starface co-founder Julie Schott, a former beauty editor at Elle magazine. She has had acne of varying severity for years. She says she was never embarrassed by it, though she was worried it meant she was bad at her job.
â€œIt didnâ€™t cause me a great deal of insecurity except for in the sense that I was a beauty editor and I felt like a bit of a failure like Why canâ€™t I crack the code? Do people not trust me because I have a breakout? Maybe they think Iâ€™m full of shit,â€ she says. â€œBut there is not a magic bullet and anyone whoâ€™s dealt with this knows that.â€
Starface stickers cost $22 for 32 stars, which come in a plastic box that looks like a yellow, cutesy anthropomorphized Airpod case. (It sells the â€œhydro starsâ€ without the case as well.) Both Cho and Rhyu said how cute and clever they think the stars are.
Schott says that other designs and styles will be forthcoming. Knockoffs will be inevitable â€” at least until the next promising product comes along on Amazon.

"The winner of Iowaâ€™s Democratic presidential caucuses will likely draw in less support than a competitive congressional race in the state.
On February 3, the nation will be looking to Iowa, where the first Americans will be able to cast their vote in the 2020 presidential elections. But if the field of 17 candidates stays that stacked, the winner could walk away having only received the support of 40,000 to 50,000 caucus-goers statewide â€” fewer people than live in Dubuque, Iowa.
â€œMaybe the top candidate ends up with 20 percent, because youâ€™ve got six strong candidates going into caucus night,â€ said Norm Sterzenbach, a former Iowa Democratic party official. â€œTwenty percent could win it, thatâ€™s only 40,000-50,000 votes.â€
In some ways, this math means the race is up for grabs.
â€œItâ€™s a relatively small number, right? Itâ€™s the size of a sort of medium-sized town,â€ said David Redlawsk, a political science professor at the University of Delaware and an expert on the Iowa caucuses. â€œIn Congressional elections, winners normally have more than 100,000 votes.â€

Of course, we still donâ€™t know what the 2020 turnout will be or how many candidates will still be running, but ultimately, a small sliver of Iowaâ€™s population participates in the caucuses. About 171,000 Democratic caucus-goers participated in 2016, just 15.7 percent of the overall population. Thatâ€™s about a quarter of the population of Washington, DC. When itâ€™s over, millions of campaign dollars and hours spent campaigning in Iowa will all be spent to win the hearts of a small number of American voters.
But unlike primaries where the raw vote totals dictate the winner, Iowa has an electoral-college-like system that rewards having support across the state. To win, candidates have to out-organize each other across the state â€” and not only make the case to turn out their own supporters but also be able to persuade other candidatesâ€™ supporters to switch to them on the day of the caucuses.
Presidential campaigns and local political experts and activists are bracing themselves for what could be an especially hectic Iowa caucus night on February 3, including John Deeth, a longtime party activist and member of the Johnson County Democrats executive committee. Heâ€™s tasked with organizing the countyâ€™s caucuses next year and expects high turnout â€” and the resultant mayhem that creates. â€œI am anticipating chaos and anarchy,â€ he said.
How to win an Iowa caucus, briefly explained
Iowaâ€™s caucuses arenâ€™t your normal election; thereâ€™s no absentee mail-in ballot or early voting. For Democrats in particular, itâ€™s a public, hours-long event where Iowans have to physically travel to one of the stateâ€™s 1,678 precincts â€” a community center, high school gym, or a public library â€” to participate.
Participating means physically congregating with people that support the same candidate. If a candidate fails to gain the support of at least 15 percent of attendees in the room, that candidate is cut from the running and their supporters have one opportunity to realign themselves with a different candidate. If a candidate does have at least 15 percent of the room behind them, then the supporters are locked in with their vote.
Political experts in Iowa told Vox theyâ€™re estimating 2020 caucus turnout could be somewhere in between 2016 and the record-setting 2008, which saw 236,000 Democratic caucus-goers show up (still just about a 16 percent turnout). For context, New Hampshire, the first-in-the-nation primary that goes after Iowa and has an even smaller population than the Hawkeye State, had turnout over 50 percent both years.
In a caucus, more candidates and higher voter turnout translates into more chaos. For example, Deeth and Sterzenbach floated the possibility that undecided voters could make up a 15 percent block in a room â€” and then be locked out of changing their vote.
This system also changes candidatesâ€™ priorities. Unlike other states where winning means getting the most votes, in Iowa delegates are allocated by precinct (based on a complicated formula); doing exceptionally well in liberal, heavily populated Iowa City doesnâ€™t mean you win outright if you cannot perform in smaller rural precincts throughout the state. That means candidates have to strategize all around.
â€œI really feel like this is an open race and I can tell you that because I have knocked on doors,â€ said Penny Rosfjord, who chairs the Iowa Democratic Partyâ€™s fourth district and has committed to Sen. Kamala Harris. â€œSometimes it has been that people have really worked hard and really tried to turn out the smaller counties. If you stack enough of those up, you are going to be in the hunt in the big picture.â€
The campaigns on the ground will tell you that the Iowa caucuses are about organizing in a way thatâ€™s different from any other state.
â€œSuccess in the Iowa caucuses demands precinct-level organization in every corner of the state â€” east to west, urban to suburban to rural, and among every constituency,â€ Jason Noble, Warrenâ€™s Iowa spokesperson, said.
You have to think about ensuring a caucus-goer can get off work, has a ride to the precinct, and can access the child care needed to be able to spend three-plus hours shuffling around a high school gym to vote. And it also means campaigns need that infrastructure in place across the whole state.
â€œItâ€™s not whether you can run up a score in one precinct but if you can be viable in a lot of different kinds of precincts,â€ said Jesse Harris, a veteran of Obamaâ€™s Iowa operation who is now advising Bidenâ€™s campaign.
Campaigns including Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Biden â€” among those that are most likely to meet the 15 percent threshold in any given precinct â€” said they are hoping to staff every single precinct with volunteers. Sandersâ€™s campaign announced this week that they have already trained more than 1,000 caucus volunteers, which involves a four-part course around delegate math, persuading voters on the ground, and organizing. They have 44,000 people in the state that have taken some kind of action to support the campaign, whether a donation or on-the-ground organizing. And thereâ€™s an awareness that number could make or break the race for Sanders.
â€œThis is not about big crowds,â€ Misty Rebik, Sandersâ€™s Iowa state director, said, just days after Sanders held Iowaâ€™s largest presidential campaign rally of the year. They have 133 staffers across 16 offices in the state. â€œWe are very proud of our crowd sizes at our events but we know it has to go deeper than that.â€
Votersâ€™ second choice might matter more this election
Several national polls have given a snapshot of votersâ€™ second choices â€” but much of the focus has been around the top-tier candidates like Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg.
Those are the four candidates that have been leading Iowa polls for months now. Warren is ahead by a slight margin, according to the RealClearPolitics average, with new polls showing Buttigieg and Sanders both gaining some momentum. All in all, the polls show a race thatâ€™s still pretty fluid.
To win the state, the second choice for voters that back the other 13 candidates, from former Housing Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, is far more powerful. The lower-tier candidates, those that are still only registering single digits in the polls, will likely be cut from the running in the first round of caucusing, unable to gain 15 percent of support, and their supporters will have to decide whether they want to vote for their second choice or go home.

â€œThe second choices are going to matter more than they usually do because thereâ€™s going to be a lot of not viable candidates,â€ Deeth said. This math has some campaigns that have consistently been polling in the double digits â€” but not quite in the lead â€” feeling more optimistic.
â€œThe 15 percent threshold is going to be important in this election,â€ Rebik said. â€œItâ€™s fine if people think they are going to gain momentum magically, but at the end of they day they have to be viable.â€
This process, called realignment, has been a crucial part of organizing for campaigns from the beginning. Sanders staffers said theyâ€™re focused on training volunteers to make the case in the room. Rebik noted the campaign is also working on technology to help the campaignâ€™s precinct captain do the delegate math in the room â€” and send results more quickly to headquarters.
As did Bidenâ€™s campaign.
â€œFrom the very beginning, if someone is supporting another candidate, we will ask if the Vice President will be their second choice â€” we have been coding that from the beginning,â€ Harris said. â€œIf you can walk in the door with 25 percent of the [caucus-goers], you could walk out with 35 percent.â€
Come February it is really anybodyâ€™s race to win, as long as they can prove their organizing chops can effectively span the entire state. It means covering a lot of ground, but not necessarily bringing in a lot of people.
â€œA candidate can shake the hand of everybody who will caucus for them in Iowa,â€ Redlawsk added."
"The question of what to do about hydraulic fracturing, aka fracking, of oil and natural gas has emerged as a rich vein of debate in the 2020 race for the White House.
Several Democratic presidential contenders including Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have proposed to ban fracking altogether, a stark shift from where the party was just a couple years ago.
â€œThere is no question I am in favor of banning fracking,â€ Harris said during the CNN climate town hall in September.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar was a bit more circumspect. â€œI see natural gas as a transition fuel,â€ she said at the town hall. â€œIt is better than oil but not nearly as good as wind and solar. I am being honest on what we need to do. We wonâ€™t immediately get rid of it.â€
Activists have pushed the candidates to address fracking because the boom in hydraulic fracturing has radically reshaped the US economic, energy, political, and environmental landscape.
Itâ€™s turned the United States into the largest oil producer in the world. It helped pull the country out of a recession. Itâ€™s created boomtowns flush with cash in once sparsely populated parts of the country. At the same time, fracking has led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the US.
Fracking involves pumping high pressure water, sand, and other chemicals into a rock formation to create fractures that can release trapped oil and gas. Itâ€™s unlocked massive quantities of energy in the United States, but it has had some side effects.
Wastewater injection from fracking wells has caused a spike in earthquakes. It has caused local air quality and safety problems. And while theyâ€™re cleaner than coal, oil and gas from fracking are still fossil fuels.
For policymakers, the difficult choice is deciding whether the benefits outweigh the harm, and if fuels from fracking can be a stepping stone toward cleaner energy. â€œThis is one of those issues where thereâ€™s just so much gray,â€ said Sam Ori, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. â€œI donâ€™t think that thereâ€™s a really clear case that says fracking is necessarily good or bad, on net.â€
And for presidential candidates, itâ€™s tough to find the right pitch to voters, who are themselves divided. A recent poll by KFF and the Cook Political Report of voters in the key swing states of Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, showed widespread support for proposals like the Green New Deal, but much less support for a fracking ban. In Pennsylvania, 69 percent of swing voters said they support a Green New Deal, but only 39 percent wanted to ban fracking.
Itâ€™s a microcosm of the broader policy discussion about the role of the fossil fuel industry in the carbon constrained future, whether it should be fought as an adversary or embraced as a partner.
As for fracking, researchers and analysts have been studying it for years and still continue to debate its merits. Here is a summary of the best arguments for and against a ban on fracking.
The best case against a ban: Fracking has reduced greenhouse gas emissions and helped expand clean energy
Though hydraulic fracturing as a technique has been around since the 19th century and the first commercial fracking for gas took place in the 1940s, the most recent fracking boom started in earnest around 2005. Thatâ€™s when the rising prices of oil and gas forced energy companies to look for other sources, when related techniques like horizontal drilling and low-cost slickwater fracking matured, and new estimates revealed the gargantuan amounts of gas stored in formations like Marcellus Shale.
Fracking has now become the dominant technique for extracting oil and gas in the US.

Fracking has risen against the backdrop of the United Statesâ€™ massive carbon footprint. The US is responsible for the highest share of cumulative global greenhouse gas emissions of any county. Currently, itâ€™s the second-largest emitter in the world, behind China. It also has some of the highest per capita emissions in the world.
Scientists have warned that if humanity wants to limit warming this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, countries would need to halve global emissions by as soon as 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
During much of the fracking boom, the US economy grew and emissions declined. One study found that between 2005 and 2012, fracking created 725,000 jobs in the industry, not counting related supporting jobs. â€œThis has been one of the most dynamic parts of the U.S. economy â€” youâ€™re talking about millions of jobs,â€ Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit and founder of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates told CNBC.
Thatâ€™s largely due to natural gas from fracking displacing coal in electricity production. Natural gas emits about half of the greenhouse gas emissions of coal per unit of energy. It doesnâ€™t have the massive land footprint that open pit mining or mountaintop removal coal mines do. While it has its own pollution problems, burning natural gas doesnâ€™t produce pollutants like ash and mercury, which can pose health and environmental hazards for years.

â€œRegardless of what you believe about the future, shale gas has played a substantial role in getting rid of carbon emissions and conventional emissions from coal,â€ said Ori.
A 2013 report from the Breakthrough Institute titled â€œCoal Killerâ€ explained that coal-fired power generation declined from producing 50 percent of US electricity in 2007 to 37 percent in 2012. Natural gas from fracking largely rose to fill that void.
The main reason for this shift is that fracked natural gas is cheaper than coal for the energy it produces. That makes it attractive for utilities, especially in competitive markets. Many natural gas power plants use combined-cycle gas turbines. Not only do they produce 50 percent more energy for the same amount of fuel compared to a single-cycle turbine, they can spool up quickly to meet surges in demand or shortfalls from other power producers. Compared to coal and nuclear power plants that have a harder time ramping up and down, this added flexibility makes natural gas power plants particularly valuable on the grid.
Even the newest, cleanest, more efficient coal-fired power plants struggle to compete with natural gas.
Natural gasâ€™s flexibility has also eased the integration of variable renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. When the breezes slow down and clouds form above, natural gas steps in. This has reduced the need for other ways to compensate for intermittency, like energy storage.
In fact, as fracking has grown in the US, renewable energy generation has doubled since 2008. Renewables, including hydropower and biomass, now comprise just over 17 percent of total US electricity generation. Coupled with nuclear power, about 19 percent of the electricity mix, that still leaves nearly two-thirds of power generation that needs to decarbonize. And that will take years.
So fracked natural gasâ€™s record as a coal slayer and renewable energy booster makes it a valuable weapon in the fight against climate change.
â€œIf youâ€™re talking about natural gas as a decarbonizing fuel while replacing coal, I think the facts on the ground really support that,â€ said Alex Trembath, a coauthor of the â€œCoal Killerâ€ report and deputy director at the Breakthrough Institute. â€œWeâ€™ve actually seen significant growth in solar and wind in particular even alongside the fracking revolution.â€
At the same time, fracking has helped insulate the US from global economic shocks, particularly in oil markets. US shale oil has provided more than half the growth in global oil supplies, so rising tensions and disruptions in countries like Iran, Libya, and Venezuela have barely moved the needle at the gas pump.
â€œThe oil price impacts of those big disruptions have been pretty muted and a lot of that has to do with the incredible growth of shale oil as a source of new supply in the global market,â€ Ori said.
In short, natural gas obtained by fracking has reduced emissions, aided the economy, and helped clean energy rise, while costing less than dirtier fuels.
The best case for a ban: Fracking keeps us dependent on fossil fuels and undermines decarbonization
Both the oil and natural gas produced from fracking have their downsides. Natural gas is mainly used for power generation (itâ€™s now the largest source of electricity in the US) while oil is mostly used for transportation, like cars, shipping, and aviation.
So while low natural gas prices have helped knock dirty coal off the market, low oil prices driven in part by fracking have encouraged more travel. In fact, transportation is now the largest source of greenhouse gases in the US. And after years of decline, US emissions in 2018 rose by 3.4 percent.

Low oil prices have undermined the business case for cleaner transportation alternatives, like electric cars and fuel cell-powered buses. Instead, the United States has experienced a growing appetite for larger, thirstier cars and more air travel.
Meanwhile, low natural gas prices have had some collateral damage for nuclear power, the largest source of clean electricity in the US. Some of the nuclear power plants that have announced early retirements are likely to see their capacity replaced by natural gas. So while replacing coal with natural gas often leads to a reduction in emissions, replacing nuclear leads to an increase.
Natural gas itself can also become a climate problem. Methane, the dominant component of natural gas, produces less carbon dioxide than coal when burned. But if methane leaks, which it often does in some quantity during normal gas extraction operations, it becomes a potent greenhouse gas. Over 100 years, a quantity of methane traps more than 25 times the amount of heat compared to a similar amount of carbon dioxide.
Of course, methane is the product, so the gas industry has an incentive to limit leaks. But leaks are difficult to track, and they could easily overwhelm the gains from replacing coal.
Robert Howarth, a researcher studying shale gas at Cornell University, recently reported that US shale gas production plays an outsized role in global methane emissions. He estimated that over the past 10 years, more than half of the global increase in methane emissions came from fracking in the US.
â€œNatural gas production in the United States is leaking somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.5 percent of the gas we produce into the atmosphere which is, you know a relatively small amount of gas if you think about it. Most of it is getting to market,â€ Howarth said. â€œBut that 3.5 percent is enough to do severe damage to the climate.â€
This is a higher leakage estimate than what the EPA and the industry calculate, but with the Trump administrationâ€™s ongoing rollbacks on Obama-era regulations on monitoring and restricting fugitive emissions of methane, the problem is poised to worsen.
And then thereâ€™s the technique of fracking itself. It requires a massive volume of water. Wells can release toxic chemicals like benzene into the air. Fracking sites can experience explosions and fires. They can contaminate drinking water. More than 17 million people in the US live within a mile of an active fracking well and research shows that fracking can lead to low birth weight in infants born in that radius.
Many of these environmental risks, on balance, are less than those associated with mining and burning coal. However, the sudden surge in fracking means that many people are being confronted with its impacts for the first time, making it a more vivid political concern. Thatâ€™s in contrast to coal hazards, which are mostly grandfathered into the public consciousness.
Another factor is that the business case for fracking is starting to weaken as more drillers declare bankruptcy. The Rocky Mountain Institute estimates that clean energy is already competitive with new natural gas power plants, and by 2035, it will be cheaper to build new wind, solar, and storage projects than to continue running 90 percent of existing gas power plants.
And when it comes to limiting climate change, a key factor is time. Methane leaked from gas wells can stay in the atmosphere for a decade. Carbon dioxide from burning it can linger for a century. So it is imperative to ramp down greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible. Yet every new natural gas power plant represents a decades-long commitment to continue using the fuel. That means gas plants will have to install carbon capture systems, which would add to their operating costs and worsen the business case further, or some poor investor is going to be left holding the bag.
â€œNot only is natural gas dangerous and destructive, itâ€™s increasingly unnecessary,â€ said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. â€œWe do think there should be a national ban on fracking.â€
What can a president actually do about fracking?
President Obama often boasted about the rise of the United States as an energy producer. President Trump has pushed to leverage US oil and gas in order to exert energy dominance. But itâ€™s clear that the era of bipartisan support for fracking at the national level has come to an end.
Now some Democrats are openly hostile to the fossil fuel industry, with Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for criminal prosecution of some companies. Democratic presidential candidates were asked about their stance on fracking during the CNN climate town hall, and they will likely continue facing questions throughout the campaign.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro said during the town hall that his past support of fracking came from a belief that natural gas would serve as a bridge fuel, â€œbut weâ€™re already coming to the end of that bridge.â€
The federal government can limit export licenses for oil and natural gas. However, a lot of the energy policy in the United States is governed at the state and local level, so a president canâ€™t easily shape the agenda without local backing.
While several candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren have proposed ending all new leases for fossil fuels on public lands, the vast majority of fracking takes place on private land. That means further restrictions on fracking would require legislation.
IHS Markitâ€™s Yergin was critical of Warrenâ€™s fracking proposal. â€œIn the US, oil production is primarily regulated by the states but there is so much that the federal government can do with a thousand cuts of regulation and so forth,â€ told CNBC. â€œAnd to just say sheâ€™s against fracking shows a total lack of understanding.â€
At the local level, despite environmental and safety concerns, voters have been reluctant to restrict fracking. A ballot measure that would have severely restricted fracking in Colorado failed last year, despite Democrats winning the governorship and majorities in both state houses.
Breakthroughâ€™s Trembath argued that a president would best be served by building an off-ramp for the bridge rather than cutting it off. It would be less disruptive and contentious and would allow the country to continue harnessing the benefits of fracking while coming up with better options.
â€œThe first way we hasten the end of the bridge is to make the [alternative] technology cheaper,â€ he said.
That would require investment in clean energy research and development, particularly for technologies like long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear. Pricing carbon dioxide would also help ensure that the biggest sources of greenhouse gases get reduced first, and the revenue these prices generate could fund further research. These are tactics that almost every 2020 Democratic contender supports.
So itâ€™s worth asking presidential contenders not just whether fracking should continue, but how they intend to transition the country off a technology that has made such a massive impression across the economy."
"President Donald Trump has often insisted there was â€œno quid pro quoâ€ between his administration and Ukraine.
In fact, there were two.
Voluminous testimony and key documents released as part of House Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry make clear that the Trump administrationâ€™s attempts to get Ukraine to launch investigations in exchange for something in return proceeded in two stages.
The first was the offer of a White House meeting in exchange for investigations. The Ukrainians were repeatedly told that Trump would agree to host new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a meeting if Ukraine pursued the investigations Trump wanted.
This was the focus of extensive discussion from at least June through August, with Trump administration officials pushing the Ukrainians to publicly commit to two investigations: into Burisma (the Ukrainian gas company Hunter Biden sat on the board of) and into purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election. But the Ukrainians did not agree.
There was also a second: The Trump administration would stop blocking hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for Ukraine if the Ukrainians committed to those investigations.
Trump himself ordered the aid blocked back in mid-July, and he seemed to connect the general topic of military aid to investigations on his late July call with Zelensky. But it wasnâ€™t until August that the Ukrainians learned the aid was being held up.
After that, the quid pro quo became explicit: One administration official, Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, began telling the Ukrainians that Ukraine would only get the aid if they publicly announced those investigations. Sondland said the same thing to several of his American colleagues â€” and he claimed several times that this was coming from Trump himself. (Arguably, this is less a quid pro quo than extortion.)
The Ukrainians seemed to have agreed to cave to this demand â€” but then, on September 11, the Trump administration lifted their hold on the military aid. It is unclear why they did so, but various recent developments may have made them concerned the scandal would soon become public â€” as it soon did.
In response to this damning fact pattern, the presidentâ€™s defenders have put forward various misleading arguments â€” either that there was no quid pro quo, or maybe that there was one but Trump didnâ€™t know about it, or maybe that there was one but the Ukrainians didnâ€™t know about it. Here is what the facts actually show.
Quid pro quo No. 1: A White House meeting for investigations
The first quid pro quo, which was discussed from at least June through August of this year if not earlier, was: If Ukraine agreed to the investigations Trump wanted, President Zelensky would get a White House meeting with Trump.
This may seem like a minor concession, but in fact, many foreign leaders badly want to be able to say theyâ€™ve met with the United States president. It bolsters their own legitimacy. Such a meeting would be particularly useful for a Ukrainian president embroiled in a conflict with Russia; it would signify, both inside his country and outside it, that he has strong US backing.
â€œTalk to Rudyâ€
The roots of this demand are in a meeting at the White House on May 23, 2019. Several US officials, including Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, had just returned from attending Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration and they had this meeting to brief Trump. These officials urged Trump to set up a call or meeting with Zelensky, but Trump was resistant. At the meeting, he gave them an instruction: â€œTalk to Rudy.â€ (Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has been at the center of Trumpâ€™s pressure campaign.)
About a month later, diplomat Bill Taylor testified he heard the first mention of a meeting-for-investigations quid pro quo. Per Taylor, Ambassador Sondland told him on the phone on June 27 â€œthat President Zelensky needed to make clear to President Trump that he, President Zelensky, was not standing in the way of â€˜investigations.â€™â€
The Ukrainians are told
Things became more explicit on July 10, 2019, when US and Ukrainian officials met at the White House. At that meeting, NSC staffer Fiona Hill testified, the Ukrainians asked about a meeting between Zelensky and Trump and Sondland told them there was an â€œagreementâ€ with White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney that the meeting would happen â€œif these investigations in the energy sector start.â€
After that, National Security Adviser John Bolton abruptly ended the meeting, but Sondland brought some attendees into a different room for further discussion. According to NSC staffer Alexander Vindmanâ€™s testimony, Sondland there asked the Ukrainians specifically for an â€œinvestigation of the Bidens.â€ (Hill does not remember an explicit reference to the Bidens, but she came in late to this part of the meeting, and says Sondlandâ€™s meaning was clear anyway. Sondland denies saying any of this.)
Over the next two weeks, discussions proceeded about setting up a phone call between Zelensky and Trump. On July 19, Volker wrote in a text message to Sondland that he â€œhad breakfast with Rudyâ€ and, when the call with Trump happens, â€œMost [important] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation.â€
Then, on the day of the call, July 25, Volker texted Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak beforehand, again making the quid pro quo very clear:
â€œHeard from White House - assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / â€œget to the bottom of what happenedâ€ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.â€
What Trump said on the phone call
On the now-infamous July 25 call itself, Trump repeatedly told Zelensky to talk to Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr about the investigations he wanted into what happened in 2016 but also into the Biden family and Burisma.
Trump did not go so far as explicitly saying a meeting would depend on those investigations, but he did closely connect the two topics, according to an NSC document summarizing the call:
I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. Thank you. Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call. Give us a date and weâ€™ll work that out.
Negotiating a statement
Then, over the following weeks, Volker, Sondland, and Giuliani all pressed the Ukrainians to issue some sort of a public statement committing to the investigations. (â€œI think potus really wants the deliverable,â€ Sondland texted Volker on August 9.)
Yermak said it would be â€œpossibleâ€ to make this statement but that it would make more sense to do it â€œafter we receive a confirmation of dateâ€ (for Zelenskyâ€™s White House visit).
They went on to exchange various drafts of the potential statement, with Volker and Sondland insisting, at Giulianiâ€™s instruction, that the statement had to mention 2016 and Burisma specifically. The Americans even sent Ukrainians specific draft language on this.
But the Ukrainians were reluctant to agree and the talks broke off â€” until the stakes were raised.
Quid pro quo No. 2: Military aid for investigations
The second and even more serious quid pro quo involved nearly $400 million in military aid Congress had approved for Ukraine for use in its conflict with Russia. And this one is more menacing - itâ€™s a threat to take something away that the Ukrainians thought they badly needed.
The timeline of when this came into play is a bit more complicated. Trump ordered the aid frozen in July and seemed to make comments connecting military aid and investigations on his July 25 call with Zelensky. But at that point, the Ukrainians didnâ€™t yet know Trump was blocking the aid. Once the Ukrainians did learn that in August, though, Sondland told them the aid would depend on the investigations.
The aid is frozen â€” but the Ukrainians donâ€™t yet know
Back on July 18, 2019, an Office of Management and Budget staffer told other Trump administration officials on a call that a hold had been placed on hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance for Ukraine. The staffer explained that this was being done because of an instruction from Trump to Mulvaney (according to Taylor, who was on the call).
The reason for the aid holdup was a mystery internally, and various State Department officials testified that they struggled to find out what was going on. Much later, once the scandal was public, Mulvaney said that one reason for the aid holdup was â€œwhether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justiceâ€ into the 2016 election. (He then attempted to say he didnâ€™t really mean that.)
In any case, Trumpâ€™s July 25 call with Zelensky occurred a week after the aid was blocked but before the Ukrainians knew about it. On the call, Zelensky mentioned buying â€œmore Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.â€ Trump immediately responded, â€œI would like you to do us a favor though,â€ and urged Zelensky to talk to Barr about â€œwhat happenedâ€ in 2016. Many have interpreted this as Trump making an implicit link between military aid and investigations.
However, though Sondland, Volker, and Taylor were all aware of the aid freeze, the issue did not initially come up in their own quid pro quo discussions with Ukrainian officials through July and most of August. In part, that seems to have been because the Ukrainians werenâ€™t aware of the aid freeze. Some Ukrainian officials learned about it in early August, according to the New York Times, but the news wasnâ€™t public until Politico reported it on August 28.
Thatâ€™s when the Ukrainians began to panic. Yermak, the adviser to president Zelensky, texted Volker a link to the story soon after it went up, and wrote, â€œNeed to talk to you.â€
Sondland starts telling everyone that the aid holdup is about investigations
Days later, both American and Ukrainian delegations arrived in Warsaw for a World War II anniversary celebration. Trump was originally supposed to go but canceled, citing a hurricane threat in the US, so Vice President Mike Pence went instead, as did President Zelensky.
According to the accounts of several witnesses, it was over this weekend that Sondland began telling people â€” including the Ukrainians â€” that the military aid wouldnâ€™t come unless Ukraine publicly committed to investigations.
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said publicly that Sondland told him this during an August 30 phone conversation.
NSC aide Tim Morrison testified that, on September 1, he saw Sondland tell Ukrainian presidential adviser Andriy Yermak that the aid wouldnâ€™t come unless Ukraine publicly committed to investigations. (Sondland initially claimed not to recall doing this but now admits that he did this.)
Taylor testified that, on September 1, after he sent an alarmed text to Sondland, Sondland told him by phone â€œthat President Trump had told him that he wants President Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election.â€ Sondland added, per Taylor, that â€œeverythingâ€ (including the aid) was dependent on that commitment, and that Trump wanted Zelensky â€œin a public box.â€ (Sondland still canâ€™t recall doing this.)
Note that, per Taylor, Sondland claimed to have discussed this issue with Trump personally.
The pressure on the Ukrainians intensifies
Over the next week, Sondland would again claim to be carrying out Trumpâ€™s instructions and would again talk to the Ukrainians to make sure they got the message.
Taylor testified that, on September 7, Morrison told him of a conversation that day between Trump and Sondland. Trump told Sondland that he was not asking for a â€œquid pro quoâ€ â€” but he again insisted that Zelensky had to publicly commit to the investigations. Morrison said he told the NSCâ€™s lawyers about this call, which he said gave him a â€œsinking feeling.â€
Taylor also testified that, on September 8, Sondland told him that Trump remained adamant about the public statement from Zelensky. Sondland said he had conveyed that to Yermak and President Zelensky, telling them that theyâ€™d be at a â€œstalemateâ€ if there was no public statement from Zelensky on the investigations. So Zelensky agreed to make one during an upcoming CNN interview.
So, in Taylorâ€™s account, Sondland is telling the Ukrainians about investigations-for-military-aid, heâ€™s saying this came from Trump personally, and the Ukrainians finally bowed to the pressure. (Again, Sondland claims not to recall any of this.)
Finally, on September 9, Taylor texted Sondland: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.â€ Sondland did not respond immediately but instead called Trump. Sondland claims they had a brief call in which Trump said he didnâ€™t want a quid pro quo.

The aid is suddenly released
Two days later â€” on September 11 â€” the Trump administration told lawmakers they would release the blocked military aid for Ukraine after all.
Why they did so remains unclear. But at that point, it was looking increasingly likely that news of the scandal would break publicly. Two days earlier, the same day Taylor had put his concerns in writing, an inspector general had written to inform House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff that a whistleblower complaint was being withheld from Congress. Schiff and two other House committee chairs opened an investigation into Giuliani and his dealings with Ukraine that day as well. One day later, on September 10, Bolton exited the White House on bad terms.
And Taylor, for one, still got the sense that the Ukrainians planned to make good on their end of the bargain. He met with Zelensky and Yermak on September 13 and told them that it was good they refused to make that public statement about the investigations. But, he testified, â€œthe body language was such that it looked to me like he was still thinking they were going to make that statement.â€
Later that day, Schiff went public with the news that a whistleblower complaint had been withheld from his committee â€” and over the ensuing week, the scandal over Trump demanding investigations would finally break into public view.
Overall, the fact pattern is clear: The Trump administration spent months trying to pressure the Ukrainians into committing to the investigations Trump wanted, first by offering the carrot of a White House meeting and then by threatening the stick of withheld military aid."
"A group of alt-right and â€œdissident rightâ€ activists have joined forces with neo-Nazis and others on the far-right fringes to attack conservatives who they feel arenâ€™t true conservatives, both online and in person.
Sunday, for instance, members of this group heckled Donald Trump Jr. at an event in California. And conservative speakers have been beset by the â€œgroypersâ€ at events in Texas, Tennessee and Arizona as well.
This group, which calls itself the â€œgroyper armyâ€ â€” â€œgroyperâ€ being a reference to a meme of Pepe the Frog, itself a meme overtaken by the alt-right â€” purports to be supporting â€œtraditional valuesâ€ within conservatism, like immigration restrictionism. And it argues that relatively mainstream conservative student groups like Turning Point USA need to be confronted because they are shutting down â€œsocially conservative Christians and supporters of President Trumpâ€™s agendaâ€ and promoting â€œdegeneracyâ€ by having gay speakers.
This â€œgroyper armyâ€ targets what it has termed â€œConservative Inc,â€ a collective epitomized by conservative speakers like pundit Ben Shapiro, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, conservative writer Jonah Goldberg, and even Trump Jr., as well as conservative student organizations including Turning Point USA and Young Americans for Freedom.
Beyond the sort of heckling Trump faced, the networkâ€™s tactics usually focus on asking speakers specific and very leading questions about Israel, immigration, and LGBTQ issues within conservatism, hoping to elicit answers that reveal the speakerâ€™s â€œfake conservatism.â€ â€œReal conservatismâ€ being defined essentially as an emphasis on ethnic and racial characteristics as determinants for immigration coupled with an isolationist foreign policy and a â€œtraditionalâ€ stance on LGBTQ issues. These tactics have gotten support from some mainstream right-leaning pundits who advocate for extreme restrictions on immigration, like Michelle Malkin.
In reality, the â€œgroyper armyâ€ is simply the alt-right of 2016 and 2017, warmed over, reenergized and using new terminology aimed at disassociating itself from the â€œopticsâ€ problem caused by the tremendous failure of 2017â€™s Unite the Right Rally, which ended in the murder of a young woman. Its leaders and advocates are racists and Holocaust deniers, its message boards wax rhapsodic about the man who perpetrated the Christchurch mass shooting, and the questions it presents to conservative speakers are based on anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and â€œwhite genocideâ€ fears.
As one source told me after a Turning Point USA event beset by â€œgroypers,â€ â€œI did not know there were this many racists out there.â€
The groyper army at work
Over the weekend, the â€œgroyper armyâ€ targeted Turning Point USA events, one featuring Donald Trump Jr. at UCLA and another featuring Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) at Arizona State.
According to a source, the former event was intended to be a brief interview conducted by Kirk, followed by a book signing of Trump Jr.â€™s new book Triggered.
But the groyper army, which made up roughly a third of the audience, overwhelmed Trump, Jr. and Trump campaign senior adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle, screaming loudly and demanding a Q&A session (The video above was from the Twitter account of a â€œgroyper armyâ€ supporter.)
Rep. Dan Crenshaw was another target of the groyper army this weekend. At an event at Arizona State titled â€œProve Me Wrong ft. Congressman Dan Crenshaw,â€ at which Crenshaw answered questions from an audience, Crenshaw was asked a series of questions which he later told me by email were â€œalmost exclusively about Israel.â€
â€œThe basic nature of their questions was to ask a question that at first seems like a legitimate policy difference, perfectly debatable,â€ Crenshaw told me. â€œBut what then becomes clear â€” and there are hints along the way â€” the motivations are deeper and darker than their original question indicated.â€
One of those questions is centered on the USS Liberty. As BuzzFeed News reporter Ellie Hall detailed in 2018:
The USS Liberty is a dog whistle referring to an incident in 1967 where Israeli forces fired on the US spy ship, killing 34, during the Six-Day War. In the aftermath, Israel said that its pilots had thought the ship was an Egyptian vessel, and apologized â€” the government eventually paid out $6.7 million in reparations to the survivors and families of the dead. Ever since, there have been unproven conspiracy theories surrounding the circumstances that question whether the attack was intentional. Both the Israeli and the United States governments have said that it was a case of mistaken identity.
The USS Liberty has now become an anti-Semitic meme, used to argue that the Israeli government is actually an enemy of the United States and that the country should not be receiving American funding. And members of the groyper army have been urged online to ask TPUSA speakers about the USS Liberty and other anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, like that of the â€œdancing Israelis,â€ which alleges that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks and five Israeli nationals â€œdancedâ€ in celebration while watching them.
They ask these questions with the hopes of creating viral content of the responses like this video, of an October 21 Turning Point USA event at Grand Canyon University.
According to the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, countering speakers by simply shouting out specific conspiracy theories is good enough. It urges readers who attend Turning Point USA events who fail in their attempts to ask questions, â€œWhen you get pulled out [by security], yell â€œGOOGLE THE USS LIBERTYâ€ or â€œGOOGLE DANCING ISRAELISâ€ or â€œAMERICA FIRST NOT ISRAEL FIRSTâ€ or just â€œNICK FUENTES.â€

A former ally of white nationalist Richard Spencer and a friend of white nationalists like Patrick Casey and Vincent Foxx, Fuentes has attempted to obfuscate his views by arguing on the messaging service Telegram that â€œAmerica Firstâ€ is a â€œtraditionalist, Christian, conservative, reformist, American Nationalistâ€ movement while the alt-right was â€œracialistâ€ and â€œtransnational.â€
But this is pure semantics, as Fuentes is a white nationalist and an avowed anti-Semite who referred to Daily Wire writer Matt Walsh as a â€œshabbos goy race traitorâ€ for condemning the El Paso, Texas, gunman who killed more than 20 people in August. In fact, in an interview with a French Canadian white nationalist, Fuentes said that the only reason he didnâ€™t call himself a white nationalist is because â€œthat kind of terminology is used almost exclusively by the left to defame.â€
â€œI think in a way itâ€™s almost redundant that youâ€™re a â€˜whiteâ€™ nationalist. We know that the word â€˜nationâ€™ almost implicitly talks about ethnicity and biology,â€ Fuentes said.
In a series of videos deleted from his YouTube account in late October, Fuentes argues (using a thinly veiled metaphor referring to black Americans as â€œblackboardsâ€ and white Americans as â€œwhiteboardsâ€) that â€œAmerica First is not America First if itâ€™s not 100 percent whiteboardâ€ and that heâ€™s a â€œwhiteboard nationalist.â€
In another video, he advocates for segregation and Jim Crow, arguing â€œeven if it was bad, who cares?â€ He has also described one of the Koch brothers as â€œan enemy of the white raceâ€ and his reaction to the El Paso shooting was to say, â€œthe easiest way for Mexicans to not get shot in Wal-Mart is to not fucking be here.â€
In September, Turning Point USA â€” which has faced allegations of racist behavior previously â€” cut ties with a brand ambassador, Ashley St. Clair, who was photographed with Fuentes, and in October, Fuentes was prevented from accessing an event at Politicon, the annual non-partisan political conference, that featured Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.
A source told me that it was the organizationâ€™s decision to cut ties with St. Clair that led to Fuentesâ€™s fight with the organization, and to a host of resignations from chapters from members more aligned with Fuentesâ€™s world view. In fact, a source told me that Turning Point USA decided to dissolve one chapter of the organization, at Kansas State University, saying, â€œTurning Point has a very specific big tent messageâ€ that Fuentes and his followers are not a part of. He said that the organization largely greeted the resignations with â€œdonâ€™t let the door hit you.â€
But he added that Fuentes isnâ€™t trying to take down just Turning Point USA: â€œHe wants to burn down Conservative Inc.â€
The war over campus conservatism
The fight over the groyper army is not just about college campuses. Itâ€™s about the future of conservatism, and what that future should look like as the groyper army attempts to make itself, as Ben Shapiro put it in a speech focused on the alt-right last week, the â€œheirs of conservatism.â€
And yes, that future begins in college. College campuses have long been where conservative groups and conservative concepts get their start, from Young Americans for Freedom and the Sharon Statement in the 1960s to the â€œtrigger the libsâ€ style of TPUSA.
Basically, there are two paths.
To Rep. Crenshaw, â€œconservative principles arenâ€™t exclusionary, and I firmly believe the Republican Party must continue to grow.â€ But in Fuentesâ€™s view, thatâ€™s not true â€” conservatism must be white, Christian, and heterosexual. As he posted on his Telegram account, â€œAmerica is NOT a propositional nation. We have NO ALLEGIANCE to Israel. We are CHRISTIANS and we donâ€™t promote degeneracy. Demographic replacement is REAL and it will be CATASTROPHIC.â€
And Fuentes and his army believe that they are the real conservatives and the true inheritors of conservatism, the last real defenders of what they view Trumpism to actually be standing against the â€œunelected face of Trumpismâ€ in Kirk and other pundits. While Charlie Kirk and others enjoy close ties to the White House, Fuentes and the groyper army believe that he and similar figures are betraying Trump by allowing LGBTQ conservatives within the movement and advocating for legal immigration.
Or, as neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin, editor of Daily Stormer, put it, â€œWe want Donald Trump to do what he said he was going to do. ... Kirk and all of these other shills and Jews are traitors to the revolution. They have attached themselves to Trump to push a big money corporatist, homosexualist, Zionist, globalist agenda.â€
In a statement, Young Americans for Freedom spokesperson Spencer Brown told me his organization sees the groyper army as working to â€œadvance repugnant views that are antithetical to conservatismâ€™s core belief in the sanctity and equality of every individual. â€œ
But to Fuentes and his groyper army, thatâ€™s precisely the problem.

"Four of the five major 2020 Democratic candidates have released detailed plans for how to improve veteransâ€™ care just in time for Veterans Day. And though their plans differ, they all agree on one thing: Former service members with undeserved â€œother than honorableâ€ discharges should receive the full suite of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) have all released new plans that include measures to expand VA benefits to 500,000 veterans who are currently denied them because of their discharge status.
Simply put, veterans with an â€œhonorableâ€ discharge â€” meaning a service member ended their service in good standing with no issues whatsoever â€” can use the VA for their physical and mental health care needs, as well as for readjustment into civilian life and reemployment assistance. Itâ€™s the only designation that doesnâ€™t negatively impact a veteranâ€™s benefits.
But those with a lesser rating, especially an â€œother than honorableâ€ discharge (OTH), have their access to VA benefits either restricted or denied altogether. Troops get that designation if their service branch determines their conduct to be a security threat or unbecoming of the uniform, among other things. Veterans with that or any designation thatâ€™s not solely â€œhonorableâ€ are said to have â€œbad paper.â€
The problem, experts say, is that sometimes a service memberâ€™s OTH rating stems from trauma-induced behavior related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or sexual assault. Some also say that minorities receive more severe punishments for infractions than other service members.
And while recent legislation â€” signed by President Donald Trump â€” allows for diagnostic and mental health services to those with an OTH rating, critics say the VA under Trump has done little to inform them that they can get at least some care now.
Which means there are likely thousands of veterans around America that should receive their earned VA benefits but canâ€™t. Thatâ€™s an issue, as veterans with an OTH discharge die by suicide and suffer homelessness and joblessness at higher rates than veterans with an honorable designation.
â€œEvery day that passes, these traumas are killing people,â€ said Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and president of the High Ground Veterans Advocacy group.
2020 Democrats, then, aim to change that.
How a service member gets â€œbad paperâ€
Last year, NPR interviewed former Marine Lance Cpl. Josh Onan, a veteran whoâ€™d served in Iraq and, after a 2006 roadside bomb, sustained a head injury and suffered from PTSD. He committed many small infractions during his time in service, which he told NPR was due to the medication he took at the time; during one of his leaves he was found with cocaine. He was promptly kicked out of the Marines with an OTH discharge â€” â€œbad paper.â€
Many would say thatâ€™s justified, as Onan broke both minor and major military rules. But some veteransâ€™ advocates argue that this kind of behavior often stems from mental health struggles and could have been avoided if the service member in question had received proper medical treatment.

Or take this hypothetical: Imagine a soldier was sexually abused by a superior officer. When asked to attend a meeting with the offending officer, the soldier chooses not to go to that gathering or perform other duties to stay away from the assailant. That could lead to the victimâ€™s other-than-honorable discharge for not doing what was repeatedly commanded.
Thatâ€™s why some believe cases like these need a formal review and appeals process to investigate and clarify the real reason for the misbehavior.
A 2017 study by the US Government Accountability Office found that around 62 percent of service members separated from the military were diagnosed with PTSD or other mental injuries within two years prior to their discharge.
â€œThe military is criminalizing rather than treating mental illnesses and other traumas,â€ Alex McCoy, the political director of the anti-Trump veterans group Common Defense, told me.
To its credit, the VA under Trump has tried to address these issues. In 2017, for example, it instituted a program to give veterans with an OTH discharge up to 90 days of care for mental health emergencies. Per the VAâ€™s own numbers, 1,818 former service members with that rating received mental health services in 2018, about three times more than the 648 people treated in 2017. And of the 2,580 veterans with the OTH designation who received VA care in 2018, 1,076 had a mental health diagnosis.
Yet critics argue the VA didnâ€™t do enough to inform eligible veterans about the new programs. â€œThereâ€™s no public awareness campaign, Trump hasnâ€™t spoken about it, and the VAâ€™s leader hasnâ€™t made it a priority,â€ says High Ground Veterans Advocacyâ€™s Goldsmith, who attempted to die by suicide while in the Army, leading the service to give him a less-than-honorable discharge.
The VA did send letters to those who could use the mental health benefits. But Goldsmith told me that it was slapdash at best, and in one case the most recent address on file for an eligible veteran was from 1968.
In the meantime, those whose misconduct is linked to their mental traumas suffer outside of the service. When a potential employer asks to see military discharge papers, theyâ€™ll see it doesnâ€™t say â€œhonorableâ€ and may be less likely to hire that candidate. â€œItâ€™s a scarlet letter of shame,â€ said Common Defenseâ€™s McCoy, who served in the Marines for six years.
Without a good income, itâ€™s hard to pay rent or buy a house. And without a job or residence, mental injuries can worsen over time â€” but yet not receive any treatment. This â€œnegative feedback loop can retraumatize a person,â€ said Goldsmith.
For those and other reasons, according to the Democratic campaigns I spoke to, solving the OTH discharge problem has become a major priority in their veterans care platforms.
Democrats need veterans to win in 2020
The VA estimates there will be roughly 19 million veterans in America next year, and a disproportionate number live in key states like Nevada, South Carolina, and Virginia. Any presidential candidate must consider and address the needs of veterans to have a shot at winning next yearâ€™s election.
Working on OTH discharge concerns is one way to get many veterans on board. Leading veteransâ€™ advocacy groups â€” Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, and Disabled Veterans of America â€” have pushed for those with the OTH rating to get more help from the VA.
Few are against this idea, but those who are cite an increased VA budget as their major concern. Thatâ€™s understandable, as the Veterans Affairs department is the governmentâ€™s second-largest agency with a roughly $220 billion budget. But itâ€™s unlikely that providing mental health services for a few thousand more veterans will substantially increase the departmentâ€™s costs, advocates say.

Still, the general popularity of the policy change helps explain why top 2020 Democrats put it in their veteransâ€™ plans.
While there are some differences, all four plans â€” from Warren, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Harris â€” basically do three things. First, they allow those with an OTH discharge to get interim VA benefits while they appeal their designation. Second, they order a review of OTH discharge cases to see if mistakes were made. Third, they call for a general overhaul of the process that leads to an OTH rating.
Those are all key measures, McCoy told me, but especially the first one. Appeals are extremely time consuming and cost money. If a veteran is unemployed, perhaps because of the designation on their discharge form, it can be hard to find a good attorney to help with the paperwork. That could lead to mistakes or the veteran not fully understanding what documents are required to plead their case.
Plus, most hearings take place in Washington, DC. If a sailor in Alaska or Arizona wants to plead her case, itâ€™s expensive to travel all the way for the session. That also makes it difficult for a potential active-duty witness who might be stationed in Germany or South Korea to make it stateside to offer testimony.
â€œThe whole process is insufficient,â€ McCoy said.
Perhaps the greatest change any of the Democratsâ€™ plans may bring, though, is the feeling veterans will experience if they finally have their wrongful OTH discharge changed on official papers. Goldsmith received a less-than-honorable discharge for his suicide attempt, which isnâ€™t as bad as the OTH rating but still stopped him from getting some benefits. It took 12 years for him to get the Army to recognize its mistake and change his paperwork to say â€œhonorable.â€
It means the world to him. â€œThis is the first Veterans Day that Iâ€™m a fully honorable vet,â€ Goldsmith told me. He hopes others in similar positions get to not only reap the benefits of being â€œhonorableâ€ veterans themselves, but also the pride of being one. â€œYou canâ€™t underestimate how much that matters,â€ he said."
"Director Martin Scorsese will not be joining the masses to see next yearâ€™s Black Widow prequel, nor be slugging down soda and getting his hands sticky with popcorn grease at 2021â€™s Thor: Love and Thunder. He was also not one of the millions who saw Avengers: Endgame.
Itâ€™s not because the famed director wouldnâ€™t be caught dead in a normal movie theater. Itâ€™s because, to him, Marvel movies arenâ€™t â€œtrueâ€ movies at all.
â€œI donâ€™t think theyâ€™re cinema,â€ the director wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times on November 4, voicing his disdain for Disneyâ€™s superhero blockbusters. â€œI was asked a question about Marvel movies. I answered it. I said that Iâ€™ve tried to watch a few of them and that theyâ€™re not for me, that they seem to me to be closer to theme parks than they are to movies as Iâ€™ve known and loved them throughout my life.â€
The New York Times piece was Scorsese expanding upon an interview with Empire in October where he first commented on Marvel. The director of The Irishman, as well as critically heralded classics like Taxi Driver and Goodfellas, ignited a discussion about Marvel movies that have seen other famed directors criticize them. Francis Ford Coppola, for instance, called the franchise â€œdespicable.â€
Given that there are countless fans of Marvel movies, enough to make this yearâ€™s Avengers: Endgame the biggest movie of all time ($2.797 billion at the worldwide box office), their comments were not taken lightly. Defenses of the Marvel franchise immediately followed Scorseseâ€™s interview, and the op-ed a week later further stoked ire from not only fans but also from makers of Marvel movies, like Taika Waititi and James Gunn. Gunn, who directed the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies and will direct the third film, tried to explain that the way Coppola and Scorsese see Marvel movies is how their movies were treated by the generation of directors before them:
View this post on Instagram
Many of our grandfathers thought all gangster movies were the same, often calling them â€œdespicableâ€. Some of our great grandfathers thought the same of westerns, and believed the films of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, and Sergio Leone were all exactly the same. I remember a great uncle to whom I was raving about Star Wars. He responded by saying, â€œI saw that when it was called 2001, and, boy, was it boring!â€ Superheroes are simply todayâ€™s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers. Some superhero films are awful, some are beautiful. Like westerns and gangster movies (and before that, just MOVIES), not everyone will be able to appreciate them, even some geniuses. And thatâ€™s okay. â¤ï¸
A post shared by James Gunn (@jamesgunn) on Oct 20, 2019 at 11:51am PDT
Scorseseâ€™s comments reached Marvel chief creative officer Kevin Feige, who responded to them on Sunday.
â€œI think itâ€™s unfortunate,â€ Feige said of Scorseseâ€™s take the Hollywood Reporter during an interview on one of the publicationâ€™s podcasts. â€œI think myself and everyone who works on these movies loves cinema, loves movies, loves going to the movies, loves to watch a communal experience in a movie theater full of people.â€
While Gunn frames this clash between filmmakers as a generational conflict, and Feigeâ€™s response is based on audience appeal, the real issue fueling Coppola and Scorseseâ€™s seemingly-out-of-the-blue backlash against Marvel is something that all involved parties might agree on: Audiences arenâ€™t going to theaters to see movies like they used to, and movie studios are compensating by pivoting away from original stories toward surefire bets. And those tend to be very expensive superhero movies, sequels, and adaptations or remakes.
Itâ€™s possible to love Marvel movies and also be terrified of a future where no one makes anything but Marvel movies. (If non-stop Marvel movies sound great to you, please attend a 29-hour marathon of them to find out what itâ€™s really like.) Scorseseâ€™s comments and the reaction theyâ€™ve triggered are evidence that this is what happens when you dismiss the joy and glee that Marvel movies bring to massive amounts of viewers.
The fight about Marvel is really about how the movie industry works
Scorseseâ€™s New York Times opinion piece is structured into two sections: why he doesnâ€™t like Marvel movies, and why Marvel movies scare him. He argues that the main problem with Marvel movies is that movie studios have changed their mindset to just want more movies in that mold instead of taking chances on more intimate films, and that worries him as a filmmaker who loathes repeating himself.
â€œSo, you might ask, whatâ€™s my problem? Why not just let superhero films and other franchise films be? The reason is simple,â€ Scorsese wrote. â€œIn many places around this country and around the world, franchise films are now your primary choice if you want to see something on the big screen.â€
Heâ€™s not wrong. People went to theaters in 2019 to see franchise or superhero films. The box office results â€” in billions and billions of dollars â€” speak to that.
According to Box Office Mojoâ€™s 2019 worldwide box office list, there were four superhero movies â€” Avengers: Endgame ($2.7 billion), Spider-Man: Far From Home ($1.1 billion), Captain Marvel ($1.1 billion), and Joker ($938 million) â€” among the yearâ€™s 10 highest-grossing movies. Three of those four are from the Marvel franchise. Sequels and remakes by Marvel Entertainmentâ€™s parent company Disney take another three spots â€” The Lion King ($1.6 billion), Toy Story 4 ($1 billion), and Aladdin ($1 billion). Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbes and Shaw ($758 million), a spinoff and the ninth film in the Fast and Furious franchise, takes another spot. The only two movies in the top 10 that arenâ€™t franchise films are two Chinese films, Ne Zha and The Wandering Earth. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will also most likely be on that list when it debuts in December.
Scorsese argues that movie studios interpret these box office returns as indicative of what the audiences want. He suggests that directors who want to be successful might see this and feel the need to keep making these same kinds of big-budget movies in order to get any of their movies financed, small or large. Studios will continue to be less inclined to take a risk on smaller movies or more original stories because those kinds of movies wonâ€™t be guaranteed to hit the way a sixth or seventh Avengers movie would.
Scorsese isnâ€™t alone in fearing the Hollywood machine, and heâ€™s not even the first person to prominently broadcast that fear. Back in June, the New York Times asked a series of Hollywood directors, producers, actors, and studio heads about the movie-going habits of your friendly neighborhood moviegoers. They came to the same conclusion as Scorsese: The market is tough for mid-sized movies that werenâ€™t franchise hits.
â€œ[E]ven we are finding that is becoming increasingly difficult as the months pass â€” not as the years pass, as the months pass,â€ Joe Russo, co-director of Avengers: Endgame said. â€œIt is a tough market, even for us coming off Endgame, to make a darker, character-driven movie. Itâ€™s not what the market was even two years ago.â€
For someone with the box office bonafides of Russo to say that itâ€™s difficult to get the funding to do a smaller movie puts the market into perspective. Imagine how hard it is for directors who donâ€™t have Endgame clout or a bevy of awards to their name to convince studios to give them a shot at directing a mid-sized drama or comedy.
We know that people go see franchise movies. We also know that the success of franchise movies has affected the market for directors who want to make smaller movies. The less obvious and trickier part of the anti-Marvel movie discourse is figuring out the reason, as Scorsese suggests, that people are seemingly only seeing these big franchise movies when they go to theaters.
The movie industry hasnâ€™t figured out how to get people to go to the movies more
Scorsese answered that question like this: People only see Marvel movies because the industry keeps moviegoers juiced on Marvel movies.
â€œIf youâ€™re going to tell me that itâ€™s simply a matter of supply and demand and giving the people what they want, Iâ€™m going to disagree,â€ he wrote in the Times. â€œItâ€™s a chicken-and-egg issue. If people are given only one kind of thing and endlessly sold only one kind of thing, of course theyâ€™re going to want more of that one kind of thing.â€
Scorseseâ€™s image of an â€œendlessâ€ stream of Marvel blockbusters is a bit of an embellishment. Since Iron Manâ€™s release in 2008, Marvel has implemented a strategy of releasing about two movies per year, with occasional exceptions. In 2018 and 2019, for example, Marvel released three movies each year to ramp up for the colossal event that was Avengers: Endgame.
The Motion Picture Association of America reported in its theatrical and home entertainment market environment (THEME) survey that in 2018, there were 758 total movies released in Canada and the United States. Ticket sales were also up in 2018 to the tune of $1.3 billion, a more than five percent increase from 2017.
So the yearâ€™s three Marvel movies made up .003 percent of the movies released in theaters. If we want to include Disney movies, that number jumps to nine, and if we were to include Lucasfilmsâ€™ Solo: A Star Wars Story, we get to 10, or still a paltry 1.3 percent.
Theatrical releases in 2018 according to the MPA MPA
The overall picture of movies released in 2018 compared with the Marvel or Disney output doesnâ€™t match Scorseseâ€™s assertion that moviegoers â€œare given only one kind of thing.â€ Being generous, you could also add movies like Aquaman, Justice League, Venom, Deadpool 2, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse into the mix, as well as franchise movies like Creed II, Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald, and Halloween, too. But even then, you barely moved the needle on that percentage, and youâ€™ve already hopped into different genres.
What Scorsese is probably getting at is that Avengers: Endgame opened to a record number of screens (4,662) in its opening weekend, while movies like Jordan Peeleâ€™s Us and Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood opened on nearly a thousand fewer screens.
Trying to find statistics of mid-sized movies is a bit of a moving target though. We know that they are struggling and we also know that 2018 was an absolutely bombshell year for the Oscarsâ€™ Best Picture nominees, even without the inclusion of the box office colossus that was Black Panther. And the MPA report also shows that the number of smaller movie theaters (one to four screens) decreased to 4,355 from 4,443, while the number of big movie theaters (five or more screens) increased to 36,220, signaling that people are going to bigger theaters, which tend to cater to the biggest movies. That doesnâ€™t even get into the unlikelihood that the independent or less expensive movies that often play at those smaller theaters rarely play outside of major metropolitan areas as it is. Someone in the Midwest may have a tougher time finding anything other than Disney fare at their local multiplex.
But we know people arenâ€™t given only one kind of thing. We also know they do keep going to theaters, as box office returns have shown us year after year, for that â€œone kind of thing.â€ And they go en masse.
The MPAâ€™s 2018 THEME report explains that the average moviegoer bought five tickets in 2018. If that moviegoer saw all the Marvel movies that year, that leaves room on the table for two more movies. Say they want to see Emily Blunt as Mary Poppins, and thereâ€™s only one left â€” maybe for Game Night and the indomitable Rachel McAdams?
Moviegoers, explained MPA
Getting people to theaters to see a movie is what Tim Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, calls â€œtheatricality.â€
â€œThere now has to be something about it that gives it that theatrical urgency, and itâ€™s true whether itâ€™s a small-budget horror film, a gigantic event film or a mid-budget original drama,â€ Rothman told the Times in that June roundtable.
People who go to the movies more than once a month make up 49 percent of movie tickets sold. MPA
Marvel movies, thanks to their 50-plus years of comic book source material and the studioâ€™s cinematic release strategy of interlocking films, have figured out how to take advantage of their theatricality. It also helps that Marvel has a track record of critically-lauded movies.
What Rothman, his fellow executives, and directors havenâ€™t totally figured out is how to crack the theatricality for the smaller films that Scorsese talks about. How do you sell a movie that doesnâ€™t have well-known roots and beloved characters that people have been waiting to see on screen? What will move someone to spend money on rising ticket prices and concessions in order to see a slower, less flashy movie in a theater?
One of the obvious levers here, in a broad sense, is marketing.
Crazy Rich Asians, also released in 2018 and based on a best-selling trilogy of books, was portrayed by its distributor Warner Bros. as a special event. The movie was a milestone for onscreen representation, featuring the first all Asian and Asian American cast in 25 years, and that achievement was something that Warner Bros., the filmâ€™s creative team, and audiences leaned into.
â€œThe weekend became a canâ€™t-miss pop culture event,â€ director John Chu said at Cinemacon earlier this year. â€œBut it wasnâ€™t about the first weekend. Our audience came back for the second and the third and they brought their parents and grandparents and friends. Some people bought tickets for total strangers.â€
But not every movie has a milestone-type cultural achievement to bank on. Booksmart, released in 2019, earned raves and was touted by critics as a canâ€™t-miss comedy. The movie underperformed at the box office, only making $24 million worldwide, and its distributor Annapurna Picturesâ€™ effort (or lack thereof) in marketing the movie was blamed for the low box office returns.
â€œWhen you have a movie thatâ€™s as entertaining, well-made, and well-received as Booksmart not doing the business it should have, it really makes you realize that the typical Darwinian fight to survive is completely lopsided now,â€ JJ Abrams, who has made big films like Star Wars and smaller ones like Super 8, told The Times as part of that roundtable. Everyoneâ€™s trying to figure out how we protect the smaller films that arenâ€™t four-quadrant mega-releases. Can they exist in the cinemas?â€
Another big variable is streaming platforms, and how their catalogs influence what people will see in theaters. A moviegoer might think: Why see a small-scale family drama like Marriage Story in a theater for a ticket that costs as much as the Netflix subscription youâ€™ll be able to view the movie with a month later?
Theater releases and streaming donâ€™t directly cannibalize each other. As Variety reported in 2018, a study commissioned by the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO), a lobbying group for theater owners, found that people who went to a movie theater nine times or more in the previous 12 months consumed more streaming content than moviegoers who only went to theaters once or twice a year. Ergo, people who go to the movies a lot also stream movies a lot.
For Paul Feig, the director behind hits like Bridesmaids, a movie that he thinks could have done better if heâ€™d released it on a streaming platform instead of theaters, was his 2018 film A Simple Favor, a pulpy thriller starring Blake Lively in a series of great suits and pants.
â€œI always felt like this was a movie that a lot of people were going to catch up with once it got to streaming,â€ he told Decider this summer. â€œItâ€™s a lot harder to get people to get up out of their houses and drive to the theater and put down money and get them to sit there, unfortunately. Itâ€™s much easier to sit in front of the TV and turn on their favorite streaming service. Itâ€™s a lot more convenient way for people to catch up, and so you just want people to be able to access it.â€
The problem with Hollywood today isnâ€™t so much that people are going to Marvel movies more than anything else. Rather, itâ€™s that the majority of the film industry hasnâ€™t figured out how to adapt to the habits of moviegoers. There is no rule that people can only see a finite number of movies per year â€” but producers, directors, and marketers of films without the same immediate cachet that Marvel has havenâ€™t figured out how to convince people to see more than five movies per year in theaters, nor determining whether a movie is worth spending the time and money to drop in theaters instead of streaming.
Perhaps thatâ€™s because movies are too expensive to attend in theaters (the average ticket price in 2018 was $9.11 according to the MPA) or maybe movie studios havenâ€™t figured out how to sell specific movies to the right audiences (RIP Booksmart), or maybe thereâ€™s a strong philosophical delineation between watching movies in our homes versus watching them in theaters. Industry experts are still trying, as they told the Times, to understand the underlying causes for these trends away from theaters. And thatâ€™s good because itâ€™s ultimately the industryâ€™s problem to fix; it isnâ€™t the responsibility of moviegoers to diversify a top-heavy, Marvel-heavy box office.
Thereâ€™s a difference between the way we talk about Marvel movies as a cultural force and Marvel movies themselves
Voxâ€™s critic-at-large Emily VanDerWerff shared an incisive observation following Scorseseâ€™s New York Times piece, which gets at the heart of this debate over Marvel movies and movie enjoyment:
Essentially: Scorsese and Coppola and Marvelâ€™s biggest critics talk about Marvel movies and their effect on the industry as â€œbad,â€ but then also casually judge the individual movies as unworthy of the term â€œart.â€
Itâ€™s the conflation between the two â€” that bad art has contributed to a bad cultural movement that leads to the conflict and debate weâ€™re having now.
In his op-ed, Scorsese generally refers to Marvel movies as â€œamusement parksâ€ and lists how they are devoid of â€œrevelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger,â€ and that the â€œpictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes.â€
He passes these judgments without listing any specific Marvel movie. But if you look at reviews for the 20-plus Marvel movies from movie critics, theyâ€™re all generally positive. The review scores for each Marvel movie over the last five years are solid amongst a variety of critics and outlets, with standouts films like Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther leading the charge.
Dismissing these individual movies as low-quality monoliths implies that disparate Marvel movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 and Captain Marvel cover the same themes just because theyâ€™re Marvel movies, or that there was no emotional danger in Avengers: Endgame. Endgame may be a pulpy comic book on the big screen, but the emotional connections that Marvel fans forged with its characters are earnest and telling. These movies are important to viewers, and are not absent of meaningful substance.
â€œI love all types of movies and always have,â€ Feige told the Hollywood Reporter. Itâ€™s â€œwhy we try to blend our films with different genres and take the success that weâ€™ve had and do different things â€” which is why we havenâ€™t made an Iron Man movie since 2013.â€
In that same vein, Scorsese mentions the aesthetic, emotional, and spiritual revelation that he sees in â€œthe filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same timeâ€ as he did, and how those movies enlarged â€œthe sense of what was possible in the art form.â€
What he doesnâ€™t mention is that a lot of these friends and filmmakers and the stories they told never really were particularly concerned with women and non-white people. To be clear, until recently with Black Panther and Captain Marvel, I donâ€™t think Marvel has been concerned with telling those types of stories either, nor has it been totally successful in doing so even now (I didnâ€™t particularly enjoy Captain Marvel, for instance).
But perhaps the decades of white men making movies about white menâ€™s experiences and rewarding those movies for it didnâ€™t really change the scope of the art form as much as Scorsese thinks they did. And maybe a movie like Black Panther or Captain Marvel is, for some people, changing the sense of what is possible in the movies they see. How does that kind of representation factor into his calculus? Does it at all?
Because of this seeming lack of empathy, Scorseseâ€™s filmography and how it tends to revolve around the stories of white male protagonists has been called into question. This in itself is thorny and unfair to Scorseseâ€™s work. While his personal filmography as a director leaves a lot to be desired on the diversity front to his critics, Scorsese has served as a producer on a number of films that give platforms to people of color â€” more than Marvel has.
Scorsese founded the World Cinema Project, part of the Film Foundation, a nonprofit organization that preserves and restores neglected films from around the world. Dismissing Scorseseâ€™s work behind the scenes on helping movies from all over the world find a wider audience would be a mistake, as itâ€™s had a significant impact on Hollywoodâ€™s tentative embrace of foreign cinema. But the backlash exhibits how deeply fans care about defending their favorite movies from what they believe is an unfair attack.
â€œEverybody has a different definition of cinema. Everybody has a different definition of art. Everybody has a different definition of risk,â€ Feige told THR, citing the hero deaths in Infinity War as a creative risk. â€œSome people donâ€™t think itâ€™s cinema. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. Everyone is entitled to repeat that opinion. Everyone is entitled to write op-eds about that opinion, and I look forward to what will happen next. But in the meantime, weâ€™re going to keep making movies.â€
Scorsese may have said Marvel movies are like â€œamusement parksâ€ derisively, but itâ€™s a strange comment â€” I wouldnâ€™t want to deprive anyone of enjoying a rollercoaster or a funnel cake simply because I donâ€™t find joy in funnel cake or rollercoasters.
But I also donâ€™t think that thereâ€™s anyone going to a Marvel movie or an amusement park looking for anything more than a Marvel movie or an amusement park. Nobody is going to an amusement park to find hopeless existentialism, unless, of course, theyâ€™re doing so ironically. Similarly, Iâ€™d wager that most people going to Marvel movies are looking for the joy and glee and wish-fulfillment that superhero movies bring, and understand that theyâ€™re not necessarily there to witness a serious Best Picture contender (Black Panther notwithstanding), or an avant-garde homage to French New Wave.
If we should be insulted by a movie that helps us experience a full spectrum of emotions, then we are ignoring how important those emotions are in the lives of people all around us.
That said, as someone who will absolutely shed a tear if you make me watch the â€œPortalsâ€ scene in Endgame, I would have no qualms laying out which Marvel movies feel like formulaic placeholders for sequels, or how a world exclusively full of Marvel movies is completely worrisome. Iâ€™m just not sure if this moment in cinema is exceptionally more hostile to art, as Scorsese asserts, than the homogenous Hollywood machine that has been around for years. I understand the general worry, but my love for Marvel movies and amusement parks doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t love other things. Stuff that Scorsese might even call â€œcinema.â€"

"â€œEven if youâ€™ve taken the abortion pill, you can still change your mind,â€ proclaims the website of a group called Alternatives Pregnancy Center.
The center offers what it calls â€œabortion pill reversal,â€ a treatment it claims can stop a medication abortion thatâ€™s already been started. Many organizations around the country are beginning to offer the procedure, and a growing number of states require that patients seeking abortions be told about it.
But thereâ€™s a problem. â€œAll of the evidence that we have so far indicates that this treatment is not effective,â€ Daniel Grossman, an OB-GYN and the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group at the University of California San Francisco, told Vox.
Pioneered by an anti-abortion doctor in California, abortion â€œreversalâ€ involves taking the hormone progesterone after the first dose of abortion medication. However, reproductive health experts, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, say thereâ€™s no evidence the procedure actually works to stop an abortion from happening. And, they warn, no one knows what the side effects might be of taking progesterone in an effort to reverse abortion medication.
But Republican-controlled state legislatures are increasingly passing bills requiring doctors to tell patients about the possibility of abortion reversal. The latest is Ohio, where the state Senate passed such a bill last week; the legislation now goes to the state House for consideration.
Anti-abortion groups argue that progesterone is safe and the laws are just a way to make sure patients are aware of their options. But reproductive health advocates say pregnant people around the country are essentially becoming test subjects in an unscientific and unethical experiment.
â€œItâ€™s one thing when states were forcing abortion providers to give information that was inaccurate about the risks associated with abortion,â€ Grossman said. â€œThis takes it to a whole new level.â€
A California doctor claims abortion medication can be â€œreversedâ€ with progesterone
Typically, a medication abortion works like this: The pregnant patient takes a pill, called mifepristone, meant to stop the pregnancy from progressing. Then, up to 48 hours later, the patient takes a second pill, misoprostol, that induces contractions and causes the uterus to empty. Mifepristone has been FDA-approved since 2000, and the procedure works to end a pregnancy about 95-99 percent of the time.
But in 2012, Dr. George Delgado, a family medicine physician in San Diego who identifies as pro-life, announced that he had developed a method to reverse the process, according to NPR. If patients changed their minds about the abortion after taking mifepristone but before taking misoprostol, he said, taking progesterone could help the pregnancy continue.
In a paper published that year, he said that of six patients who had received progesterone injections after taking mifepristone, four were able to continue their pregnancies.
When his research came to the attention of anti-abortion advocates, states around the country started passing laws requiring doctors to tell patients that medication abortions could be reversed. The first, Arkansas, passed its law in 2015, and such laws are now on the books in at least eight states, though courts have blocked enforcement in some. Five states â€” including Arkansas, which expanded its requirements â€” have passed laws this year alone, according to HuffPost.
Ohio could become the sixth â€” the bill passed the state Senate last Wednesday and now heads to the House, where Republicans have a majority. The stateâ€™s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, has signed abortion restrictions in the past, including a ban on the procedure after about six weeksâ€™ gestation, which has been blocked in court.
Abortion â€œreversalâ€ isnâ€™t backed up by evidence
Abortion opponents and groups identifying as pro-life argue that abortion reversal laws are necessary to make patients aware of their options.
â€œWomen should be given full, informed consent when they are considering an abortion,â€ Ingrid Skop, the chairman-elect of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told Vox.
â€œBecause the abortion pill regimen can be reversed,â€ she said, â€œthey should be given that information.â€
But many medical experts say thereâ€™s no evidence that progesterone does anything to reverse abortion. In a 2017 statement, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Delgadoâ€™s 2012 paper, involving just a handful of patients, was â€œnot scientific evidence that progesterone resulted in the continuation of those pregnancies.â€
As the group noted, mifepristone on its own does not always work to end a pregnancy, with up to half of patients who take mifepristone alone remaining pregnant. Thatâ€™s why mifepristone is prescribed with misoprostol to complete an abortion. So itâ€™s possible that Delgadoâ€™s patients who remained pregnant would have done so regardless of whether they received progesterone.
In 2018, Delgado published another paper, this time looking at the effect of progesterone on 547 patients who took it after taking mifepristone. He found that in 48 percent of cases, the patient went on to have a live birth, with the rate going up to 64 percent if the progesterone was administered by injection.
Critics, however, point out that this paper was not published in a mainstream scientific journal but rather in Issues in Law and Medicine, a journal that has featured anti-abortion legal analysis as well as articles promoting the debunked theory of a link between vaccines and autism, as Rewire.News reports.
And according to Grossman, the design of the research may have inflated the success rate of the treatment. Some providers involved only prescribed progesterone after an ultrasound confirmed that the pregnancy was continuing, meaning that people for whom mifepristone didnâ€™t work well to begin with may be overrepresented in the data.
In addition, Grossman said, itâ€™s not clear from the paper whether patients were informed that the treatment was experimental. Delgado has not responded to Voxâ€™s request for comment, but he told NPR that before his 2018 paper, he told patients that abortion â€œreversalâ€ was a â€œnovel treatment.â€ Now, he says, â€œwe have a substantial amount of data. There is no alternative. And itâ€™s been proven to be safe,â€ so, â€œwhy not give it a chance?â€
Progesterone is sometimes prescribed during pregnancy for other reasons, like to prevent premature labor in the second and third trimesters, Grossman said. But thereâ€™s no data on whether itâ€™s safe to give after mifepristone or to take throughout pregnancy, as â€œreversalâ€ patients are sometimes advised to do.
â€œThe impact on patients of mifepristone combined with high doses of progesterone is virtually unstudied,â€ Kathryn Eggleston, medical director of the sole abortion clinic in North Dakota, wrote in an affidavit obtained by HuffPost. Researchers do not know, she said, whether the combination could cause birth defects, for example.
Moreover, as Grossman noted, the prescription of an unproven treatment to pregnant women has disturbing echoes in Americaâ€™s past. â€œWe know that abortion patients are more likely to be women of color and low-income women,â€ he said, and these are â€œpopulations that have had research performed on them that was clearly unethical.â€ For example, in the 19th century, Dr. J. Marion Sims conducted gynecological research, including operations without anesthesia, on enslaved women.
However, there are researchers working on a study of abortion â€œreversalâ€ designed to meet ethical and scientific standards. Mitchell Creinin, an OB-GYN and professor at the University of California Davis, is conducting a controlled study of progesterone treatment that has been approved by an institutional review board, according to NPR. The results should be available next year.
For now, though, abortion providers say laws like the one proposed in Ohio will hamper their ability to ethically care for pregnant people.
â€œAbortion reversal is unproven, unscientific, and potentially unsafe,â€ Tam Nickerson-Scott, clinic operations director at Preterm, Ohioâ€™s largest abortion provider, told Vox. â€œWe certainly donâ€™t want to give out false information to our patients.â€
Crisis pregnancy centers are offering an unproven treatment to pregnant people
Itâ€™s not clear how many people are currently being prescribed abortion reversal in the United States. But Skop, the AAPLOG chair, believes it is â€œvery commonâ€ and says that most â€œpregnancy resource centersâ€ â€” facilities that offer counseling with an anti-abortion bent, also called crisis pregnancy centers â€” offer the procedure. Obria, an anti-abortion group with facilities around the country that recently received a federal family planning grant from the Trump administration, advertises the procedure on its website.
Itâ€™s also not clear how patients who do get progesterone treatment pay for the medication. Unproven treatments are typically not covered by insurance, Grossman noted. Skop said that patients sometimes pay for progesterone out of pocket and that sometimes pregnancy centers may cover the cost.
Meanwhile, one of the biggest questions around abortion reversal is how many people really want to undo their abortions once theyâ€™ve started. Some say the number is significant. â€œWomen do regret their abortions,â€ said Skop. â€œIâ€™ve been practicing for 23 years, and Iâ€™m also the board chairman of a pregnancy resource center, and we see it frequently.â€
However, research shows that most patients are actually quite sure about their decisions to have an abortion. One recent study found that, on average, abortion patients were as or more sure of their decision to have an abortion than people facing other medical procedures, such as knee surgery. Another found that 95 percent of abortion patients did not regret the procedure.
But itâ€™s possible that abortion reversal laws could actually lead to more regretted abortions. In her affidavit, Eggleston, the North Dakota provider, wrote that abortion reversal laws could encourage people to get medication abortions before they are ready to do so, by giving them the mistaken impression that the procedure can be easily reversed if they change their mind.
For Nickerson-Scott, meanwhile, the Ohio bill â€œjust causes more hurdlesâ€ in a state where patients already have to go through a 24-hour waiting period and a total of three doctorsâ€™ appointments to complete a medication abortion. Instead, Ohio patients deserve â€œautonomy over their bodies,â€ she said. â€œWe have to trust people that they are the expert of their lives.â€
â€œI have never heard anyone who has come through our doors and who has told me that they have regretted their abortion,â€ Nickerson-Scott said. â€œWhat I do hear is, â€˜Thank you for being here.â€™â€"

"The nationâ€™s most powerful gun rights organization was dramatically outspent in Virginia in 2019 by gun control organizations, helping Democrats gain control of the state legislature for the first time in more than two decades.
According to the Virginia Public Access Project, the National Rifle Association spent $350,269 this cycle to help pro-gun rights candidates beat back Democrats who were running on a gun control platform, one that became particularly poignant after a mass shooting in Virginia Beach on May 31 left 12 people dead. (An NRA spokesperson cautioned that total spending numbers for the organization will not be available until later this month.)
But gun control groups spent far more, hoping to help get Democratic candidates into office who could push forward a package of proposals aimed at stemming gun violence, including background checks on all firearms sales and a ban on so-called â€œassault weapons.â€ Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund and Everytown for Gun Safety Victory Fund (backed in part by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg) report that they spent $2.5 million in Virginia, making the group the biggest outside donor in the race â€” and Giffords PAC, named for former Rep. Gabby Giffords, spent $300,000 on a digital ad campaign alone.
Democrats didnâ€™t win either the House of Delegates or Senate seat for Virginia Beach, but across the state, gun control was the top issue for voters and for Democratic candidates, according to one poll, with several candidates running explicitly on vows to â€œtake on the NRAâ€ to pass gun control legislation. According to Everytown, that focus (and money) resulted in at least three flipped seats that helped Democrats take control of the legislature. Gov. Ralph Northam said Wednesday that he now hopes to be able to pass a slate of gun control measures, and â€œbecause of that Virginia will be safer.â€
The gun control push in Virginia comes as the NRA is perhaps in its weakest position in years, the result of lawsuits and an investigation by New York State officials that has put the organizationâ€™s finances under a microscope. In draft remarks to reporters, Everytown CEO John Feinblatt said Wednesday, â€œNRA is a paper tiger.â€
He added, â€œThe NRA may be based in Fairfax, Virginia, but we outspent them in Virginia by 8-1. In other words, the NRA couldnâ€™t defend its own backyard.â€
Gun control groups pushed hard in Virginia after yet another mass shooting
On May 31, 2019, a public utilities employee walked into a Virginia Beach Municipal Center and shot more than a dozen people both inside and outside the building, killing 12 and injuring four others before dying in a firefight with police. In a press conference after the shooting, Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer described the attack as â€œthe most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.â€
In response, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called a special session of the Virginia legislature and put forth eight proposals aimed at tightening the stateâ€™s gun laws, including a ban on silencers and so-called â€œassault weapons,â€ limiting handgun purchases, and creating a Extreme Risk Protective Order so that law enforcement could take firearms from people deemed to be potential threats (a proposal the NRA voiced support for in March 2018.)

But as my colleague Catherine Kim reported earlier this year:
When the legislature convened, the GOP shut down the meeting in less than two hours. The group refused to address gun control, saying that not enough research had been conducted on the appropriate legislative direction prior to the â€œprematureâ€ session, and suggested Virginia do what it did after the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, when then-Gov. Tim Kaine, commissioned a blue-ribbon panel to study mental health and gun control. The legislature ultimately passed some of the panelâ€™s recommendations.
Virginia has comparatively loose gun laws â€” the state permits open carry and does not require a permit to purchase or have a rifle, shotgun, or handgun, but it does regulate gun shows. The Giffords Law Center, which supports gun control measures, gave the state a â€œDâ€ rating for its existing laws. (Itâ€™s worth noting that Guns and Ammo Magazine, which supports a maximalist interpretation of gun rights, ranked the state No. 31 in the country, noting efforts by Democrats to pass gun control legislation.) And the majority of Virginia Republicans in the legislature received â€œAâ€ grades from the NRA.
The Republican-controlled legislature ultimately took no votes on either the measures proposed by Northam or those put forward by other Virginia lawmakers, a decision Northam called â€œshameful and disappointing,â€ particularly since the legislature would not be reporting back to work until November 18 â€” several weeks after the election.
In response, gun control organizations made Virginia a priority, particularly as all 140 legislative seats in the increasingly blue state were up for grabs this cycle. That â€” plus recent redistricting due to unconstitutional racial gerrymandering of congressional districts â€” made flipping both the Virginia House and Senate a real possibility. In his remarks, Feinblatt said, â€œThereâ€™s no question about it: What happened in Virginia Beach â€” and most importantly, what didnâ€™t happen afterwards â€” set the stage for this election.â€
The NRA lost big in its home state
The NRA argued that, in this race, it emphasized donor contact and get-out-the-vote efforts rather than big donations. In comments to the Washington Post in September, NRA spokesperson Catherine Mortensen said in part, â€œThe Bloomberg and Everytown/Moms Demand lobbyists may outspend the NRA, but they will never outwork us.â€
But that wasnâ€™t the case just two years ago, when the gun rights group spent more than $2 million in the state, including a $750,000 advertising buy aimed at lifting Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie. That was a race with statewide offices at stake, not legislative ones, but itâ€™s still a good indication of how much the NRA cared about defending gun rights in the state: $2 million was bigger than the NRAâ€™s in-state spending in any of the three previous cycles, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.
As Iâ€™ve been reporting, the NRA â€” still powered by its 5 million members and a close relationship with the White House â€” has been struggling both politically and financially. The group was largely unable to get much of its legislative agenda through Congress while Republicans held total control in 2017 and 2018, and revenue drops resulted in less available cash to spend in the 2018 midterms.

The NRAâ€™s revenue from membership dues â€” a one-year membership costs $45 â€” has dropped 21 percent since 2016, from $163 million to $128 million, according to the nonpartisan transparency organization OpenSecrets. Other donations to the NRA dropped too, from $128 million in 2016 to $98 million in 2017. That revenue drop has led to cost-cutting measures across the organization, from raising the cost of dues to dropping free coffee and water at its Fairfax, Virginia, headquarters to major layoffs at the groupâ€™s media outlet, NRATV.
But most importantly, the revenue drop dramatically impacted how involved the NRA got in the 2018 midterm elections. The group got involved in about half the races in 2018 that it did during the previous midterm cycle, and the amount it spent dropped as well â€” from $25 million in 2014 to less than half that this cycle.
That revenue drop came as the result of massive spending in the 2016 election to get Donald Trump in the White House. And the challenges facing the organization go far beyond revenue. Coupled with a federal investigation into the groupâ€™s ties with Russian entities, the NRA has faced the loss of one of the groupâ€™s top lobbyists, Chris Cox; a lawsuit filed against New York State over an insurance program aimed at helping NRA members who are involved in self-defense shootings; and another series of lawsuits filed against the NRAâ€™s former advertising and public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen.
Those lawsuits have centered on a series allegations of financial mismanagement and fraud leveled against Ackerman McQueen by the NRA, and allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of funds against the NRA by Ackerman McQueen.
As I reported a few weeks ago:
The lawsuits have already proven deeply embarrassing to both the NRA and to Ackerman McQueen, and cost both entities millions in court costs. For Ackerman, the NRA was once the firmâ€™s most prominent and lucrative client; now the firm is facing a lawsuit that could cost it millions. And for the NRA, the allegations â€” high-spending executives, accusations of sexual harassment, and an overall lack of oversight â€” have damaged the groupâ€™s reputation among some gun rights supporters. Even President Donald Trump has urged the NRA to â€œget its act together,â€ and the allegations against LaPierre have riled prominent members of NRAâ€™s leadership.
If Tuesdayâ€™s results in Virginia are any indication, however, Americaâ€™s largest gun lobby did not â€œget its act together.â€ In a statement on the election, the NRA argued that Virginians would ultimately reject gun-control candidates and concluded, â€œAs the battle continues, so does the NRAâ€™s defense of the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.â€
But the lawsuits, investigations, and loss of funding have all been a massive distraction for the NRA, and gun control organizations are taking advantage. In Virginia, those organizations have helped shift the balance of power in the state legislature and, with it, hope to push for gun control legislation in a state that houses the countryâ€™s biggest gun rights group."
"The facts of HernÃ¡ndez v. Mesa are simply horrific.
Sergio HernÃ¡ndez, a 15-year-old Mexican boy, was playing at the United States-Mexico border near El Paso, Texas. Just inside of the American side of this border is a fence, and HernÃ¡ndez and his friends were allegedly playing a game where theyâ€™d cross the border, touch the fence, and then ran back. At some point, Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa arrived and detained one of HernÃ¡ndezâ€™s friends, while HernÃ¡ndez fled to the Mexican side of the border.
What happened next is contested. The government claims that HernÃ¡ndez and some others threw rocks at Mesa. HernÃ¡ndezâ€™s family claims that he was â€œunarmed and unthreatening.â€ In any event, it is uncontested that Mesa drew his gun and fired. A bullet struck HernÃ¡ndez in his face, killing him.
The question facing the Supreme Court in HernÃ¡ndez is whether, even if Mesa killed HernÃ¡ndez in cold blood, Mesa is immune from a lawsuit brought by HernÃ¡ndezâ€™s family. Regardless of who is telling the truth, the Supreme Court must assume at this early stage of litigation that the familyâ€™s version of the facts are correct, because the issue before the Court is whether the family may successfully sue Mesa if they prove that the facts are what they claim.
Yet, if the Courtâ€™s recent precedents in similar cases are any sign, it is very likely that Mesa will prevail. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in HernÃ¡ndez on Tuesday.
In its 1971 decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the Court permitted federal lawsuits against law enforcement officers who violate the Constitution. But it has spent the better part of the last four decades tearing down that decision. With five hardline conservatives now entrenched on the Supreme Court, HernÃ¡ndez could transform Bivens into an empty shell.
The result would be that many constitutional violations by federal law enforcement would go unredressed. Victims of federal agents who violate the Constitution may no longer be able to sue those agents.
The Supreme Court will decide whether great power comes with great responsibility
Although the Bill of Rights places a bevy of restrictions on law enforcement officers, including the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s ban on â€œunreasonable searches and seizures,â€ the Constitution is silent on whether individual officers may be sued if they violate them. A federal law permits suits against state law enforcement officers who violate â€œany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,â€ but there is no such statute that explicitly authorizes suits against federal agents.
Bivens held that the right to sue federal law enforcement is nonetheless implicit in the Constitution. â€œPower,â€ Justice William Brennan wrote for the Court in Bivens, â€œdoes not disappear like a magic gift when it is wrongfully used.â€ A law enforcement agent who acts unlawfully â€œin the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.â€ And thus the Constitution must offer a remedy to victims of rogue federal agents.
Brennanâ€™s opinion, in other words, rests on something comic book fans will recognize as the Spider-Man rule â€” with great power comes great responsibility. If the federal government gives someone the power that comes from a badge and a gun, and that federal agent unconstitutionally abuses that power, then the agent may be held accountable for their actions by compensating their victim.
Not long after the Supreme Court handed down Bivens, however, the Court took a sharp right turn â€” and itâ€™s steadily moved rightward ever since. The Supreme Court has â€œconsistently refused to extend Bivens to any new context or new category of defendants,â€ according to its decision in Ziglar v. Abbasi (2017), and itâ€™s â€œrefused to do so for the past 30 years.â€
The conservative narrative regarding Bivens is that Brennanâ€™s opinion is a relic of a bygone age. â€œIn the mid-20th century, the Court followed a different approach to recognizing implied causes of action than it follows now,â€ Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the Court in Abbasi (â€œcause of actionâ€ is a legal term referring a type of lawsuit that plaintiffs are permitted to bring). During what Kennedy describes as an â€œancien regime,â€ â€œthe Court assumed it to be a proper judicial function to â€˜provide such remedies as are necessary to make effectiveâ€ a statuteâ€™s purpose.â€™â€ Thus, the Supreme Court would routinely â€œimply causes of action not explicit in the statutory text itself.â€
As the Court moved rightward, however, â€œthe arguments for recognizing implied causes of action for damages began to lose their force.â€ Under this new, more conservative understanding, â€œit is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles for a court to determine that it has the authority, under the judicial power, to create and enforce a cause of action for damages against federal officials in order to remedy a constitutional violation.â€ While the Court has not explicitly overruled Bivens, it strenuously avoids applying it to new contexts, and any attempt to do so is now â€œdisfavoredâ€ by the Supreme Court.
To understand the values underlying this shift away from Bivens, read Judge Edith Jonesâ€™s opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in HernÃ¡ndez, the decision now being reviewed by the Supreme Court. If Border Patrol agents fear lawsuits for possibly violating the Constitution, Jones writes, they may â€œhesitate in making split second decision.â€ And such hesitation â€œcould undermine the Border Patrolâ€™s ability to perform duties essential to national security.â€
If someone like Jesus Mesa has to think twice before firing their gun at a 15-year-old boy, that could undercut the Border Patrolâ€™s ability to prevent â€œthe illegal entry of terrorists, terrorist weapons, persons, and contraband.â€
Jones, in other words, argues for a kind of anti-Spider-Man rule. With great power must come the ability to use it â€” lest that power fail to protect us from terrorists.
And it is likely that there are five men on the Supreme Court who agree with Jones. The Courtâ€™s conservative majority spent the last four decades undercutting Bivens. And the current Court is more conservative than any Supreme Court in three generations.
Can Bivens be saved?
The thrust of the conservative case against Bivens is that Brennanâ€™s decision was the product of a less responsible era â€” and an anomalous one at that. As Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in Correctional Services Corporation v. Malesko (2001), Bivens â€œrecognized for the first time an implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizenâ€™s constitutional rights.â€ The key words here are â€œfor the first time.â€
Bivens, at least according to its opponents, was a departure from how the law ordinarily operates. Thus, rolling it back means restoring the law to the way it always should have been.
Lawyers for the HernÃ¡ndez family push back hard against this narrative, claiming that it is ahistorical, and that Brennanâ€™s opinion merely brought greater coherence to a long line of cases holding that government actors may be sued when they act outside the law. The familyâ€™s brief recounts a long list of older Supreme Court decisions, some stretching back to the earliest days of the Republic, including Little v. Barreme (1804), which held that a Navy officer who unlawfully seized a neutral ship â€œmust pay such damages as are legally awarded against him, and Wise v. Withers (1806), which held that a federal official was liable as a trespasser after he â€œentered the plaintiffâ€™s home to collect a fine that had been (improperly) imposed by a court-martial.â€
The brief spends several pages naming pre-Bivens cases, some of them quite old, where the Court held that a federal officer could be sued for stepping outside the law. As the Supreme Court held in Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Commerce Corp. (1949), â€œthe principle that an agent is liable for his own torts is an ancient one and applies even to certain acts of public officers or public instrumentalities.â€
The narrative pushed by the HernÃ¡ndez familyâ€™s brief, in other words, is that Bivens was not an anomaly at all. Rather, it merely brought an added degree of coherence to the ancient doctrine that government agents may be sued for their illegal actions. Before Bivens, the brief argues, federal officers were often held â€œto account under state law.â€ Bivens assured that these officers would, as Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote in a separate opinion, be held to account â€œaccording to uniform rules of federal law.â€
Thus, under this narrative, Bivens was a modest opinion. Rather than creating a new kind of lawsuit out of nothing, it simply held that the law governing federal officials who violate the Constitution should be uniform across all 50 states.
The implications of this narrative is that a Supreme Court decision cutting too deep into the right to sue federal law enforcement officers who violate the Constitution would itself be a departure from ancient legal principles â€” and that this is especially true in a case such as HernÃ¡ndez, where the HernÃ¡ndez family has no way to seek redress for their injury unless they can bring a Bivens suit.
The HernÃ¡ndez family effectively accuses judicial conservatives of committing the very sin that those conservatives lay at the feet of Justice Brennan â€” the sin of ignoring settled legal principles to advance a political agenda.
Will that be enough to convince the Court to rule in the HernÃ¡ndez familyâ€™s favor? Itâ€™s doubtful. The conservative assault on Bivens has marched steadily forward for nearly four decades. It is on the cusp of victory. And the current slate of justices is more conservative than any Supreme Court since the 1930s.
It is likely, in other words, that federal law enforcement will gain a level of legal immunity that they havenâ€™t enjoyed for a very long time â€” perhaps ever. And this broad new immunity will have a profound impact far away from the border as well.
As the HernÃ¡ndez family notes in its brief, â€œsince Abbasi, the Third Circuit has held that Bivens remedies are unavailable against rogue Transportation Security Administration officers, and the Fourth Circuit has foreclosed Bivens claims against rogue Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.â€
Thus, the brave new world imagined by Judge Jones is already upon us. When the Supreme Court decides HernÃ¡ndez, it will likely only seal the deal.

"The Equal Rights Amendment is closer than itâ€™s ever been to becoming a reality after Democrats took control of both the House and Senate in Virginia on Tuesday. But even if the state ratifies the ERA, thereâ€™s still a looming legal debate over whether it can actually be enshrined in the United States Constitution.
The ERA, an amendment that guarantees equal rights regardless of sex, passed Congress on a bipartisan basis in 1972 and requires 38 states to ratify it in order to become part of the Constitution. Thirty-five states rapidly did, the last being Indiana in 1977, but then its momentum was halted when it became a culture war battleground.
It took 40 years for a 36th state â€” Nevada â€” to ratify the ERA in 2017, and then Illinois became the 37th state in 2018.
That brings the country within one state of meeting the bar. And Democrats in Virginia, who took control of both stateâ€™s legislative bodies on Tuesday, have said they plan to ratify the ERA, which would make Virginia the 38th and final state. â€œOne thing we are going to need to do right away is pass the Equal Rights Amendment in Virginia,â€ state Senate Democratic leader Dick Saslaw told supporters on Tuesday, according to CNN. â€œItâ€™s high time we include the women of this country in the Constitution of the United States.â€
Virginiaâ€™s ratification doesnâ€™t directly translate to the ERA finally making it into the Constitution â€” itâ€™s decades past the deadline Congress set for that to happen. The ERAâ€™s supporters say thereâ€™s a legal workaround, so we may soon find out whether it will work.
The Equal Rights Amendment had a lot of momentum behind it in the 1970s, and then it just sort of petered out
The Equal Rights Amendment dates back to the 1920s and came about after the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. It was first introduced by suffragist leader Alice Paul in 1923, and has three simple parts:
Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.
Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.
Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.
The amendment gained momentum in the 1960s and â€™70s, culminating with passage in the US Senate and the House of Representatives in 1972, which put it on track to become what would have been the 27th Amendment in the Constitution. It was sent to the states for ratification and put on a seven-year deadline.
Support was, initially, bipartisan and broad. In the first year after the amendment was passed, 22 states ratified it.
But opposition began to emerge, led by anti-feminist conservative leader Phyllis Schlafly, who argued the ERA would erase legal differences between men and women and would lead to an America where men wouldnâ€™t be required to support their wives, anyone could walk into any bathroom, women could be drafted, and same-sex marriage would be legalized. Schlafly died in 2016 at the age of 92.
â€œSince the women are the ones who bear the babies, and thereâ€™s nothing we can do about that, our laws and customs then make it the financial obligation of the husband to provide the support,â€ Schlafly said in 1973. â€œIt is his obligation and his sole obligation. And this is exactly and precisely what we will lose if the Equal Rights Amendment is passed.â€
Schlaflyâ€™s line of attack caught on, as did others â€” that the ERAâ€™s passage would expand abortion rights, that it would infringe on statesâ€™ rights, that it would be costly to businesses. Indiana became the 35th state to ratify the ERA in 1977. Then its momentum stalled.
The ERA has gotten new life in recent years
After lying dormant for decades, the ERA has begun to gain momentum in recent years. Nevada ratified it in 2017, Illinois in 2018, and now Virginia appears to be on the cusp of doing so.
Activists point to a number of factors contributing to the amendmentâ€™s revival, including the #MeToo movement, the backlash to Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency and Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 loss, and the number of women who have entered into the political arena as of late. During the 2019 State of the Union address, many Democratic women in Congress wore pins that read â€œERA Yes.â€
â€œThereâ€™s been a lot more interest and a lot more attention in the news media about some of the wrongs against women and the inequalities that we face,â€ Roberta Madden, the co-president of the ERA-NC Alliance in North Carolina, told me last year. â€œThatâ€™s focused the attention in a way that it hasnâ€™t before.â€
The 2016 documentary Equal Means Equal renewed attention on the issue as well.
Virginia got close to ratifying the ERA last year, but the GOP-controlled legislature ultimately rejected it. A House committee refused to take it up, and a Senate panel defeated it 9 to 5. Men cast all of the â€œnoâ€ votes. With Democrats in control, hopes are high that next time around will be different.
The ERA missed its deadline. Supporters argue it could still get another chance.
A 38th state ratifying the ERA wouldnâ€™t be the end of it. Itâ€™s 37 years past the deadline Congress set for it to become a constitutional amendment: Congress originally set a 1979 deadline, and when that date hit, the amendment only had 35 ratifications. Congress extended the deadline to 1982, but it missed that as well.
Still, there are some potential workarounds.
A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service said Congress could just vote to change the previous deadline.
Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) introduced legislation in 2017 that would remove the ratification deadline for the ERA. â€œIf Congress, by majority vote, said that the deadline was â€™82, then Congress by majority vote could say that the deadline is many years from now,â€ Jane Mansbridge, a Harvard professor and the author of Why We Lost the ERA, said in a 2018 interview with the Harvard Kennedy School PolicyCast.
Supporters of the ERA also point to the â€œMadison Amendment.â€ In 1789, James Madison first proposed that Congress shouldnâ€™t be allowed to give itself a raise â€” any pay increases wouldnâ€™t take effect until the next congressional term began. Six states had ratified the amendment by 1792. Then the effort stalled for 190 years. In 1982, an undergraduate student, Gregory Watson, figured out that the amendment could still be ratified and started what would eventually become a successful grassroots campaign to ratify, in 1992, the 27th Amendment.
Some Republicans at the state level have supported the ERA, and its supporters hope that many of the myths and misconceptions about it have dissipated. It was, at least initially, a bipartisan issue in the 1970s, and it could be again.
In 2014, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said at the National Press Club that if she could choose any amendment to add to the US Constitution, it would be the Equal Rights Amendment. â€œI think we have achieved that through legislation, but legislation can be repealed, it can be altered,â€ Ginsburg continued. â€œSo I would like my granddaughters, when they pick up the Constitution, to see that notion â€” that women and men are persons of equal stature â€” Iâ€™d like them to see that is a basic principle of our society.â€"
"A group of 27 countries met in Paris this month to raise $9.8 billion for the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program that routes money from wealthier countries to poorer ones to combat climate change.
But climate activists said it was a disappointing haul for a program critical to meeting the goals of the Paris climate accord â€” where countries agreed to limit warming this century to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an aspirational limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius.
â€œSeveral European countries set the bar high and threw real money on the table. This is a good start but in no way adequate to meet the needs on the ground,â€ said Wendel Trio, director of the Climate Action Network, in a statement. â€œCountries who pledged below their fair share and failed to live up to their obligations must urgently top up their contributions.â€
The fundraising came just before the United States, the second-largest emitter in the world, announced its intent to file the formal paperwork to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, making it the only country in the world to back out of the deal.
Hitting the Paris targets requires the whole world to take action, but not every country has the resources to do so. And motivating every country requires addressing the fundamental injustice of climate change, that the nations that contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most. Many less-developed countries are also counting on cheap energy from fossil fuels to grow their economies and are reluctant to commit to caps on greenhouse gases. Rather, countries like India and China argue that the biggest historical emitters should be making the most aggressive reductions and financing the transition to clean energy in poorer areas.

Programs like the GCF are intended to commit countries that have benefited the most from burning fossil fuels to use their wealth to aid countries that have fewer resources â€” and that stand to face climate-change consequences like worsening extreme weather and rising seas.
This can take the form of grants, loans, and loan guarantees for projects like building seawalls or deploying renewable energy. While the amount of money proffered so far disappointed campaigners, both donors and recipients say they are focusing on strategy that could offer the most bang for the buck: using nature to mitigate and adapt to warming.
Nature-based solutions were a major theme during the United Nations Climate Action Summit, an international meeting in September to prod countries to do more to fight climate change. Though the summit failed to deliver the commitments for big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres wanted when he convened the event, countries pledged more money to preserve forests, restore wetlands, and deploy sustainable agriculture practices in developing countries.
Protecting pristine nature or allowing it to recover from human development are essential tactics for fighting climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported earlier this year that destructive patterns of land use account for 23 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Of this, deforestation and forest degradation account for 17 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. That means stopping these losses and reversing them would take a massive bite out of humanityâ€™s contributions to climate change.
However, natural climate solutions are not as simple as planting more trees; these tactics require rigorous accounting and monitoring on the ground, adding to their cost and complexity. Nature also canâ€™t simply compensate for all the greenhouse gases we emit, so drastic reductions in emissions in tandem are still essential. And when they involve wealthy countries deciding what to do with land in developing countries, these projects raise thorny political issues around social justice, national sovereignty, and which country gets to claim credit for emissions reductions.
Yet even with these difficulties, donor countries say that international climate financing for nature preservation and restoration is essential and are counting on these programs to meet their own targets to curb emissions. Countries like France, Sweden, South Korea, and the United Kingdom pledged to increase funding for these efforts during the climate summit and are nudging other countries to do so as well.
The details of these international financing programs are due to be nailed down at the next major UN climate meeting in December in Madrid, where countries will delve into the specifics of how they intend to meet their own targets and how efforts to help developing countries will count toward their own climate change goals.
Preserving and restoring nature can be a powerful way to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects
The worldâ€™s forests, wetlands, prairies, and mangroves provide many services to humanity. Theyâ€™re habitats for iconic and valuable plants and animals. They serve as buffers against severe weather. Theyâ€™re uniquely beautiful.
These ecosystems also take in and store a vast quantity of carbon. That makes preserving and restoring these systems a powerful tool in limiting climate change. Recent studies have found that restoring forests alone can compensate for a vast amount of human-caused emissions. Conservation efforts can also yield huge economic returns, ranging from creating new tourist attractions to blunting the costly impacts of warming for the most vulnerable.
And in developing countries, home to some of the most valuable and pristine natural systems â€” like tropical rainforests â€” the stakes are high. These ecosystems punch above their weight in absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, and they face some of the toughest economic pressures for deforestation.
These factors are a big reason why donor countries like the United Kingdom are so interested in ecosystem conservation as a method to combat climate change targeted in these regions. Beyond setting one of the most aggressive decarbonization targets in the world for itself â€” net-zero emissions by 2050 â€” the UK announced at the climate action summit that it would double its contributions to international climate financing, pledging at least Â£11.6 billion ($14.9 billion) over the next five years, with Â£1.44 billion ($1.85 billion) for the GCF.
â€œWe are putting much, much more emphasis on investing in nature-based solutions to tackling climate change,â€ said Zac Goldsmith, minister of state for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the United Kingdom. â€œAnd the reason for that is that you get more solutions. Youâ€™re not just tackling climate change. Youâ€™re talking about biodiversity issues and tackling poverty issues.â€
Using nature to deal with climate change takes many forms
The UNâ€™s Green Climate Fund is a key way to fund nature-based climate solutions in developing countries. Through its various programs, the fund deploys grants, loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments. It was initially established in 2010 and raised $10 billion in its first round of funding in 2014. Projects funded through the GCF include renewable energy microgrids in Mali and seawalls in Tuvalu.
â€œWe have a particular focus on the least developed countries and small island developing states and African countries â€” the most vulnerable countries [to climate change],â€ said Simon Wilson, communications coordinator for the GCF. â€œWe have projects ranging from Bhutan, which is a country with about over half of its territory is actually protected areas â€” we have projects that support their efforts in protecting the forests â€” through to countries like Morocco, where weâ€™re doing things like supporting farmers to develop new crops, regenerative crops for example, which are more climate resilient but at the same time prevent deforestation in other areas.â€

The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) is another climate financing mechanism for developing countries, focused specifically on reducing deforestation. Rather than donations, this program functions on a credit system, where one country can offset a quantity of its own emissions by restoring a section of forest in another country. This is an increasingly important tactic for countries that want to make deep cuts in their contributions to climate change but have exhausted their easiest options for curbing emissions.
And itâ€™s not just national governments supporting these programs. Businesses are also buying into nature restoration programs. Last month, the California Air Resources Board adopted the stateâ€™s Tropical Forest Standard. This allows California to buy up sections of tropical forests to offset its greenhouse gas emissions.
Getting and proving results from ecosystem restoration is hard
While the potential for using nature to fight climate change is immense, itâ€™s proven difficult in practice to implement. Planting trees, restoring grasslands, and protecting coastlines arenâ€™t a get-out-of-jail-free card for global warming.
A big issue is verification. Lisa Song at ProPublica has extensively reported on how carbon offsets in the form of forest preservation have failed to deliver the promised results:
In case after case, I found that carbon credits hadnâ€™t offset the amount of pollution they were supposed to, or they had brought gains that were quickly reversed or that couldnâ€™t be accurately measured to begin with. Ultimately, the polluters got a guilt-free pass to keep emitting COâ‚‚, but the forest preservation that was supposed to balance the ledger either never came or didnâ€™t last.
In many of the most remote and pristine parts of the world, itâ€™s difficult to monitor just how much carbon an ecosystem is absorbing. These areas also require ongoing protection and maintenance from people on the ground to thwart illegal logging, poaching, and extraction.
Many of these offset programs also presume that a preserved or restored natural area will stand indefinitely, but as the recent rise in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon shows, that wonâ€™t hold up if political winds shift away from conservation. And paying someone not to cut down a forest only works until someone comes by willing to pay more.

Another concern is the accounting problem of additionality, linking the cause and effect of a potential donation and conservation effort. That means making sure that an acre of rainforest or a stretch of coastal wetlands is preserved as a direct result of a given funding effort. If a credit, grant, or investment goes to secure an ecosystem that wasnâ€™t facing any threat to begin with, it isnâ€™t leading to an additional reduction in emissions. The same is true for purchasing credits for restoration efforts within a country that were already underway.
However, establishing that a program is additional requires evaluating a counterfactual â€” that a particular nature preserve or restoration effort would not have happened were it not for this purchase â€” and many initiatives have struggled to demonstrate that this is true for their interventions.
But the biggest hurdle for using natural solutions to fight climate change might be the politics. Having one country induce a change in another is already a fraught endeavor. Add in wealth inequities between countries, pressures for economic development, and national sovereignty concerns, and these funding programs can end up producing mediocre results.
â€œThe Green Climate Fund just has not worked very well,â€ said Thomas Lovejoy, a biologist and senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation. â€œThere has been a lot of pushing and pulling and politics in it.â€
One of these debates is over which country gets to claim the emissions reduction from a restored natural system on their balance sheet: the country selling the credit or the country buying it. The concern about double counting emissions reductions remains one of the biggest outstanding issues of the Paris Agreement, and signatories are still trying to come up with an equitable way to account for this.

Some countries are also strongly opposed to the idea of another country buying up a swath of territory and declaring it off-limits for development. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, speaking at the UN General Assembly last month, decried the very idea that other countries could have an interest in protecting the Amazon rainforest.
â€œIt is a fallacy to say that the Amazon is the heritage of humankind, and a misconception, as confirmed by scientists, to say that our Amazonian forests are the lungs of the world,â€ said Bolsonaro. â€œUsing these fallacies, certain countries instead of helping, embarked on the media lies and behaved in a disrespectful manner and with a colonialist spirit. They even called into question that which we hold as the most sacred value: our own sovereignty.â€
Donor countries have labored to thread this needle â€” between a global imperative to combat climate change with political concerns in countries that are home to some of the most valuable natural tools to limit warming. Itâ€™s a delicate process, and the stakes are immense.
â€œItâ€™s not for a country like the UK to come pile-in on another country and demand that they do particular things,â€ said the UKâ€™s Goldsmith. â€œBut then equally, the Amazon is a global asset. Thereâ€™s no escaping that. If the Amazon were to be destroyed tomorrow, the whole world would feel the reverberations in a very, very, very frightening way.â€
But while itâ€™s difficult to get this right, it isnâ€™t impossible. And with the window rapidly closing to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the world needs all options on the table, including funding to protect and regenerate natural systems that take in and store carbon. Thatâ€™s why many countries are still putting money into these programs.
â€œYou can come to these kinds of things and throw up a lot of objections and questions and at least half of them, Iâ€™m sure, are justified,â€ Lovejoy said. â€œBut theyâ€™re all resolvable in the end. We all need a better future, and if we can get some revenue flowing into making that possible, letâ€™s go for it.â€
But domestic politics could still undermine international efforts to finance climate change responses. Spain is now hosting the December UN climate conference because the Chilean government backed out after widespread unrest. This was only after Brazil declined to host the summit, shortly after a new government was elected in 2018. Amid the disruption, the conference will test just how committed countries are to working together to keep nature whole.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the UKâ€™s pledge total for international climate financing."
"Itâ€™s not Election Day 2020 yet, but on Tuesday we got the next best thing.
Voters all over the country headed to the polls to decide local and state elections. The headline-grabbing contest was Democrat Andy Beshear beating Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin in the Kentucky governorâ€™s race â€” a state President Donald Trump won by a whopping 30 percent in 2016. Some caveats: Bevin was among the most unpopular governors in the country, and other Republican leaders in the state outperformed him on Tuesday.
But Beshearâ€™s win was still a big loss for Trump, who campaigned in Kentucky just a day before the election, explicitly tying Bevinâ€™s race to his own reputation. The results also showed that Democrats in Kentucky were fired up â€” Beshear outperformed the 2015 Democratic gubernatorial candidate in many areas of the state.
The other huge story was Virginiaâ€™s state legislature elections, where Democrats flipped both the state House and Senate, ensuring a trifecta with Gov. Ralph Northam (D) already in the governorâ€™s mansion.
Virginia has been trending blue for years, but the fact that Democrats generated so much enthusiasm in an off-year where state legislature elections were the biggest thing on the ballot means the party is organized and enthusiastic, even for traditionally sleepier races.
Many of the questions going forward are going to be what this all means for Trump and Republicans in 2020. Itâ€™s not good news for them, for sure. If we learned one thing from Tuesday, itâ€™s that Democrats are fired up â€” even in redder states.
But thereâ€™s a lot of other impacts that extend far beyond Trump.
Loser: Donald Trump
Headlining a Lexington rally for Bevin on Monday night, Trump beseeched Kentucky voters to reelect the Republican governor he was supporting.
â€œIf you lose, theyâ€™re going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world,â€ Trump said. â€œYou canâ€™t let that happen to me!â€

Maybe â€” just this once â€” Trump shouldnâ€™t have phrased it in such stark terms, because Bevin losing is exactly what happened. Itâ€™s worth stressing that Bevin was incredibly unpopular on his own for saying inflammatory things about Kentuckyâ€™s teachers and threatening to cut Medicaid expansion.
But beyond the optics of a Trump ally losing in Trump country, thereâ€™s one other worrying sign for Republicans in Tuesdayâ€™s results: The 2018 trend of the suburbs rebelling against the president and his party is continuing. Bevin also performed poorer than expected in the traditionally Democratic Appalachian coal counties that went for Trump in 2016. Now, this doesnâ€™t necessarily mean Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell â€” up for reelection in Kentucky next year â€” is doomed. Nor does it mean Democrats will magically have a landslide in the state in 2020.
But Trump wanted to project strength going into an election year when heâ€™ll be on the ballot, and Bevinâ€™s loss has to hurt, badly.

Winner: Democratic organization and enthusiasm
Virginia and Kentucky demonstrated one clear thing: Democrats were fired up. No matter what caveats exist in each state, thatâ€™s great news for the Democratic Party heading into 2020.
Beyond his turnout wins, Beshearâ€™s message could give the national party hope. He ran primarily on health care and education â€” vowing to protect Medicaid and boost funding for teachers â€” a strategy Democrats could replicate in other Trump-friendly states and regions like West Virginia, another state that has seen teachers strikes.
Democrats also won their enthusiasm test in Virginia. A caveat here â€” Virginia has been trending more and more blue every year, so winning was not a huge surprise. However, Democrats were looking for signs of enthusiasm, and they got them in Virginia. Anecdotally, turnout was up significantly in the state. Thatâ€™s important especially because Virginia had no governorâ€™s race or US Senate contest on the ballot, presenting both Democrats and Republicans with a unique opportunity to show how strong the party apparatus was.

â€œIt shows you the relative strength of the parties at this point in time without anybody at the top of the ticket,â€ Republican strategist John Feehery told Vox recently. â€œIf you take away any personalities, it just gives you a glimpse with a natural setting of what the political barometer is.â€
The political barometer in Virginia, at least, was very good for Democrats. In the last week leading up to Election Day, Democrats and grassroots activists told Vox they were seeing signs of more enthusiasm for voting than usual.
â€œI think the intensity going in is so strong,â€ said Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a group aiming to increase the diversity of the Virginia electorate by encouraging minorities and immigrants to vote.
That intensity lasted, showing that Democrats arenâ€™t just laser focused on beating Trump in 2020. Theyâ€™re also organizing for races up and down the ballot â€” and that won them total control in Virginiaâ€™s legislature for the first time in a generation.
â€” Ella Nilsen
Winner: Medicaid expansion
In Kentucky, Mississippi, and Virginia, Medicaid expansion â€” arguably one of the most effective and life-saving provisions in the Affordable Care Act â€” was on the line.
For context: The Affordable Care Act initially expanded Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low income people, to everyone making less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line. But a 2012 Supreme Court ruling weakened the policy, allowing states to reject the expanded program. As of 2019, 36 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Medicaid expansion and 14 have not.
Weâ€™ve seen a wealth of research showing that expanding Medicaid has not only vastly increased access to health insurance, but also improved health outcomes. About 13.6 million adults gained Medicaid coverage under Obamacare. One recent study found that by the fourth year of Medicaid expansion, mortality rates in states that expanded the program were 0.2 percentage points lower than in states that did not.
On Tuesday, voters largely reaffirmed their interest in increasing health care access in their states.
In Kentucky, Beshear beat Bevin, who threatened to end Medicaid expansion in his push to implement work requirements, premiums, and co-payments for the stateâ€™s most vulnerable population. As Dylan Scott explained for Vox, thereâ€™s a lot of evidence that most Medicaid recipients do work, and many could still lose their coverage because the requirements arenâ€™t structured to address the irregularities of low income work. Ending Medicaid expansion in Kentucky could have stripped health insurance from around 400,000 people.
Virginiaâ€™s Democratic governor managed to pass Medicaid expansion, but it has had eligibility limitations because of the stateâ€™s Republican statehouse. But on Tuesday, Democrats flipped the state Senate and House, ensuring the program would be protected in the future and giving Democrats the chance to get rid of those limitations.

Winner: Teachers in Kentucky
When Kentuckyâ€™s Republican governor Matt Bevin went after state pensions in 2018, teachers across the state took to the streets in protest. And when Bevin responded by calling them â€œignorantâ€ and â€œthugs,â€ Kentucky teachers rallied around the phrase â€œRemember in Novemberâ€ to make education a top priority for voters. It wasnâ€™t enough to flip the stateâ€™s seats in Congress in the 2018 midterms, five out of six of which are still held by Republicans.
But on Tuesday, they did remember for the governorâ€™s race.
Kentuckyâ€™s underfunded pension system, one that since 2000 has accumulated $43 billion in debt, was at the center of the governorâ€™s race. During his first term, Bevin pushed a reform that cut pensions for new teachers and funding for public schools, resulting in massive teacher protests. Earlier this year, Kentucky teachers called in sick en masse, shutting down every public school in the state.

And Bevin didnâ€™t try to endear himself to teachers; he called them â€œselfishâ€ and said kids were likely exposed to sexual assault because teachers were protesting instead of staying in the classrooms. He eventually apologized, but not without saying teachers were acting like â€œthugs.â€
Beshear made education a central part of his campaign for governor. His platform on education for the state gives every teacher an immediate $2,000 across-the-board pay raise and ensures teachers arenâ€™t paid less than $40,000. He is also proposing new funding streams for the pension system â€” proposals Bevin attacked as unfeasible.
It should be said that even with Beshear in the governorâ€™s mansion, he will face a challenge in the state legislature that remains controlled by Republicans. Nevertheless, Kentuckians voting out Bevin is a huge victory for teachers after a year of protests.

Loser: the NRA
Virginia voters on Tuesday helped Democrats take the state legislature out of Republican hands. In doing so, voters also handed a major victory to gun control advocates in the state â€” and a major defeat to the National Rifle Association, also headquartered in Virginia.
Gun control became an especially relevant issue in Virginia this year with the May shooting at Virginia Beach, in which a gunman killed 12 people. That led Democrats to try â€” and fail â€” to pass a new slew of gun control measures. But the topic has stuck in the publicâ€™s mind: A poll in October from the Washington Post and Schar School found that three in four voters rate gun policy as a â€œvery importantâ€ issue in relation to their ballots, making it the top issue overall.
The advocacy group Giffords Law Center gives Virginia a D for its gun laws and ranks the state 22 out of 50 for the strength of its laws. Virginia does not, for example, have universal background checks, a â€œred flagâ€ law that lets courts take away weapons from people deemed dangerous, or an assault weapons ban.

Democrats have been trying to change that, with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam pushing for stronger gun laws since his election last year. But after Northam called for a session to consider his proposals earlier this year, the Republican-controlled legislature quickly voted along party lines to adjourn the legislature until after the elections.
So gun control advocates hoped to bank on the Virginia elections to flip the legislature and, subsequently, get stricter gun laws passed. According to NPR, gun control groups outspent the NRA in the state by about 10 to 1 as of October.
Now, gun control groups have a potential majority in the state legislature, and the NRA no longer does. That could lead to big changes in Virginiaâ€™s gun laws.

Loser: Republican gerrymandering in Virginia
Part of the reason Republicans hung onto the Virginia state legislature for so long was gerrymandering. With Democratsâ€™ win on Tuesday, Republicans can no longer draw the maps to their advantage â€” in either state House or US House districts.
The party in control of Virginiaâ€™s House of Delegates doesnâ€™t just have a huge hand in crafting policy; itâ€™ll also be responsible for drawing Virginiaâ€™s new congressional maps in 2021 after the 2020 census. And with Tuesdayâ€™s win, state Democrats become the big winners of the future here â€” with huge implications for the stateâ€™s congressional delegation.
Given the stateâ€™s history with gerrymandering, that process will be closely watched. Virginiaâ€™s old maps were drawn by House Republicans in 2011; packing black voters into districts to dilute their vote. And that was noticeable even during Democratsâ€™ big wins in 2017; even though Democrats won the overall vote by about 9 points in House of Delegates races, gerrymandered districts made it so Republicans still controlled the chamber â€” barely.
A lot has happened since then. In 2018, a district court in Virginia ruled the old maps an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, and new maps fairer to Democrats were drawn at the beginning of the year (these maps may have also helped put them over the top in Tuesdayâ€™s election). To solidify that, the US Supreme Court upheld the lower court ruling this summer.
But the process of redrawing is about to start all over again, and the House of Delegates wields the pen.
â€œWhether or not weâ€™ll have fair maps for the next decade remains to be seen,â€ Tram Nguyen, the co-director of New Virginia Majority, told Vox recently.
Democrats got their chance on Tuesday night.

Winner: Voting reform
Ranked-choice voting advocates scored a big win Tuesday, when New York City overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that made it the most populous city to adopt the reform.
Under ranked-choice voting, voters rank their top five candidates in order of preference, rather than simply picking one candidate. Itâ€™s a set-up that pushes candidates to engage with a broader swath of voters in order to pick up their support and allows voters to support lesser-known candidates without a sense of â€œwastingâ€ their vote.
The past few years have marked significant progress for ranked-choice voting, which is now used in more than 20 cities. The tactic, first employed for a federal election by Maine in 2018, has also garnered prominent backing from the likes of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet.
The New York City ballot measure means local voters will be able to use ranked-choice starting in 2021 for regional elections like City Council. In California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley where the reform has been used, ranked-choice has been found to increase the diversity of the candidates vying for seats, and even that of those who are ultimately elected.
Plus, because New York City has now approved the measure, itâ€™s possible even more cities and states will consider adopting the same when more ballot initiatives are up for a vote next year.

Winner: Equal rights amendment
In addition to boding well for the party going into 2020, Democratsâ€™ sweeping wins in Virginia could also mean crucial momentum for the Equal Rights Amendment.
The ERA, a potential amendment to the Constitution, would codify equal protections for men and women under the law, guaranteeing protections like equal pay. It needs to be ratified by 38 of 50 state legislatures in order to come to fruition. Presently, the ERA has been approved by 37. If Virginia were to vote in favor of the ERA, it would hit the threshold it needs for ratification.

That said, Congress had previously set 1982 as a deadline for this process, which means that lawmakers would have to vote to undo that deadline in order for the amendment to ultimately be ratified. Given the uncertainty around this potential deadline and whether Congress would be willing to take action on it, itâ€™s not yet certain that the measure will advance.
A vote to ratify it from Virginiaâ€™s newly minted state legislature, however, would mark a massive step forward.

"Author and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll filed a lawsuit against President Trump on Monday morning, accusing him of defamation.
Carroll wrote earlier this year that Trump had sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, forcibly penetrating her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store. Trump said he had never met Carroll, despite a photograph published in the same piece that showed the two together, and argued that she was accusing him to boost sales of her book.
â€œEach of these statements was false,â€ Carroll says in her lawsuit. â€œEach of them was defamatory.â€
Carroll argues that Trumpâ€™s statements damaged her reputation, and is seeking a retraction as well as punitive damages. She also says she wants the president to face justice for his words, if not for his actions.
â€œWhile I can no longer hold Donald Trump accountable for assaulting me more than twenty years ago, I can hold him accountable for lying about it and I fully intend to do so,â€ Carroll said in a statement to media on Monday.
The advice columnist is just one of at least 22 women who say Trump has sexually harassed, assaulted, or otherwise violated them. Trump has denied all these allegations, calling all the women liars. And Carroll is not the first to push back by suing â€” Summer Zervos, a former Apprentice contestant, filed a defamation suit against Trump in 2017, also arguing that Trump had damaged her reputation by calling her a liar. On Tuesday, phone records released as part of that case showed that Trump called Zervos on his cell phone around the same time she says he sexually assaulted her, according to the Washington Post.
Insulting the women who come forward with allegations against him has been part of Trumpâ€™s playbook since before his presidency began. Now Carroll has become the latest woman â€” and the best-known â€” to seek legal recourse for those insults. And while they may not be as high-profile as the impeachment inquiry into the presidentâ€™s dealings with Ukraine, these suits could have an impact on Trumpâ€™s bid for reelection.
Trump called Carroll a liar. Now sheâ€™s suing him.
Carrollâ€™s allegation against Trump first became public in June, when she wrote in New York Magazine that in 1995 or 1996, Trump had assaulted her after they ran into each other at a Bergdorf Goodman department store. The encounter began playfully, she wrote, with Trump asking her to try on lingerie for him, and her telling him that maybe he should do so instead. But when she agreed to go with him to a dressing room, she said, that changed.
â€œHe lunges at me, pushes me against the wall, hitting my head quite badly, and puts his mouth against my lips,â€ Carroll wrote. Then, she wrote, he forcefully penetrated her with his penis before she was able to escape.
Trump responded to the allegation by saying that Carroll was lying, and was just trying to sell copies of her upcoming book, from which the New York Magazine story was an excerpt, as Jan Ransom reports at The New York Times. He also said that he had never met Carroll, even though the New York Magazine story included a photograph of the two of them together.
And he said the advice columnist was â€œnot my type,â€ a response heâ€™s employed several times to denigrate women who accuse him of sexual misconduct.
â€œTrump knew that these statements were false,â€ Carroll says in her suit, filed Monday with a New York court. â€œAt a bare minimum, he acted with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity.â€
In the suit, Carroll argues that Trumpâ€™s comments caused her emotional pain, reputational damage, and â€œsubstantial professional harm.â€
â€œCarroll filed this lawsuit to obtain redress for those injuries and to demonstrate that even a man as powerful as Trump can be held accountable under the law,â€ the suit states.
Her lawsuit could keep the allegations against him in the public eye leading up to 2020
Carroll joins Summer Zervos in filing a defamation against Trump for insults levied after an allegation of sexual misconduct. Zervos says that Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007, kissing her without her consent, touching her breast, and pressing his genitals against her when she met him for a meal at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She spoke out publicly in 2016, after the Access Hollywood tape was released, showing Trump bragging about his ability to grab women â€œby the pussy.â€
But after Zervos and others came forward with allegations, Trump said â€œevery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.â€ He also specifically denied Zervosâ€™s allegation and his campaign released a statement by her cousin arguing that she had made it for personal gain.
Zervos sued Trump for defamation in 2017 and her case has been working its way through the courts ever since. The case is currently in discovery, and on Tuesday, phone records released as part of the case showed that Trump called Zervos on his cell phone around the time she says he sexually assaulted her, the Post reports.
Trump had previously of Zervos that he â€œnever met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago.â€ But Trumpâ€™s private calendar, also released in the case, shows that he checked into the Beverly Hills Hotel on December 21, 2007. His phone records, released Tuesday, also show a three-minute phone call he made to Zervos that day.
Zervosâ€™s lawyer Mariann Wang told the Post the records corroborated Zervosâ€™s account â€œwith a degree of precision that [Zervos] could not have known were she not telling the truth about those interaction.â€ Trumpâ€™s legal team has not yet commented to the Post.
For a time, some believed the discovery process in the Zervos case could lead to Trumpâ€™s impeachment â€” after all, President Clinton was impeached thanks to his statements during a sexual harassment lawsuit against him filed by Paula Jones. But Zervosâ€™s suit and the more than 20 sexual misconduct allegations against Trump have faded from public view somewhat amid an impeachment inquiry dealing with his alleged attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden.
Carrollâ€™s suit could bring those allegations back to the fore, at least to some degree. It also means Trump will potentially be tied up in not one, but two lawsuits having to do with sexual misconduct allegations leading up to his reelection campaign next year.
Of course, many women had already come forward with allegations against Trump by November 2016 â€” and yet he was voted in anyway. Itâ€™s not clear if things will be different in 2020.
But one thing is clear: Carroll is not going to let Americans forget about her story. â€œI am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled,â€ Carroll said in her statement Monday. â€œNo person in this country should be above the law â€” including the President.â€"
"On Tuesday, New York City residents will vote on whether to double the number of Americans who use a new system of voting â€” ranked-choice voting â€” to elect officials.
Technically, Ballot Question 1 amends the City Charter to â€œGive voters the choice of ranking up to five candidates in primary and special elections for Mayor, Public Advocate, Comptroller, Borough President, and City Council beginning in January 2021.â€
But practically, it would be a tremendous lift for a growing electoral reform movement that includes Maine; Sante Fe, New Mexico; Oakland, California; and Memphis, Tennessee. As the biggest city in the nation (population 8.6 million), New York City would add considerably to the users of ranked-choice voting.
As the name suggests, ranked-choice voting lets voters mark their first-choice candidate first, their second-choice candidate second, their third-choice candidate third, and so on. Each voter has only one vote but can indicate their backup choices: If one candidate has an outright majority of first-place rankings, that candidate wins, just like a traditional election.

But if no candidate has a majority in the first round, the candidate in last place is eliminated. Voters who had ranked that candidate first have their votes transferred to the candidate they ranked second. This process continues until a single candidate gathers a majority.

Most expect New Yorkers to approve ranked-choice voting on Election Day. A wide range of groups and local leaders have endorsed the reform, and it has faced little opposition. New York City has often been on the forefront of good government reforms. Its small-donor campaign finance matching system was the first in the nation, and a model for the campaign finance proposal in HR 1.
Supporters argue that ranked-choice voting can reduce polarization and divisive campaigning by changing the incentives. Instead of just competing to be votersâ€™ first choice, candidates are also competing to be votersâ€™ second, third, and sometimes fourth choices, encouraging candidates to make wider appeals. Ranked-choice voting also tends to encourage a more diverse candidate pool, and leaves voters feeling happier about the process, both because their vote is more likely to matter and because they can vote for their favorite candidate without worrying about playing spoiler.
Vox is covering the results live, here.
Ranked choice voting, explained
New York City may become the most populous place in the US yet to adopt ranked-choice voting, but itâ€™s hardly a pioneer.
Twenty cities in the United States have already adopted ranked-choice voting. In 2018, Maine became the first state to adopt it for federal elections. That catapulted the reform to a national spotlight, with presidential candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet now championing it. Australia has used ranked-choice voting for 101 years, and Ireland has used it for 98 years.
Studies have shown that in places that have adopted it, ranked-choice voting has made politics a little less nasty. Candidates spent less time attacking each other, as compared to similar cities that didnâ€™t adopt ranked-choice voting. Voters in cities with the system reported being more satisfied with local campaigns as a result (again, as compared to similar cities).

Ranked-choice voting has also increased the share of racial minority, female, and female minority candidates running compared to similar cities. The scholars who have studied this most closely believe more minority candidates ran because under ranked-choice voting, such candidates could reach out to other communities where they might not be the natural first choice and ask for second-choice votes.
The researchers believe women were more likely to run because under traditional winner-take-all elections, â€œwomen were deterred from running for office by â€¦ negative campaigning.â€ But with less negative campaigning and more cooperative campaigning, women are more likely to run. Theyâ€™re also more likely to win, scholar Sarah John and her colleagues concluded.
Under ranked-choice systems, voters donâ€™t have to try to figure out whether to support the candidate with the best chance of winning or the candidate they like best but fear canâ€™t win. They can vote sincerely for their favorite candidate on their first choice, and then select back-up choices if their preferred candidates donâ€™t do well. This also allows voters to express their full range of preferences, sending clearer signals than the traditional approach to voting. And in the end, more voters are likely to wind up voting for a winner. Voters prefer this kind of â€œpreferentialâ€ voting because they consider it fairer.
No voting system is perfect. Critics of ranked-choice say the task of having to rank multiple candidates unfairly overwhelms low-information voters, and that the added complexity hits low-income minorities hardest. The editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle last year called the process â€” in place for more than 15 years â€” â€œa baffling experience for many voters,â€ and decried a plan by two San Francisco mayoral candidates to defeat another, London Breed, by â€œgamingâ€ the ranked-choice system.
However, surveys have shown no difference in understanding of ranked-choice voting between white and nonwhite voters, and more than 90 percent of voters who have used the system describe it as simple. Some studies show turnout declines among minority voters. But most likely, when properly accounting for other factors, turnout has probably remained stable, with no declines in poorer precincts.
Americans are showing greater interest in alternatives to our voting system
While some cities with ranked-choice voting have used it to combine primary and general elections or general and run-off elections (saving taxpayers money), New York City would be unusual in applying ranked-choice voting only to the primary election and not to the general election.
However, in a heavily Democratic city like New York City, the deciding election is often the Democratic primary. Because of this, the primary often generates a crowded field, which means that a candidate can win with a mere plurality â€” not a majority â€” of votes under the current rules.
According to one analysis, in the last three election cycles, almost two-thirds of multi-candidate city primary contests (64 percent) did not generate a majority winner. And in almost a third of those elections (30 percent), the winning candidate got less than 40 percent of the vote. In other words, under the current rules, candidates preferred by far less than half of their constituents get to represent all of their constituents.
Under ranked-choice voting, outcomes like this canâ€™t happen. The winning candidate needs to earn true majority support â€” a plurality does not make a victory. And if no candidate gets a majority of first-preference votes, thatâ€™s when the rankings kick in, and candidates are eliminated and their preferences redistributed until one candidate has a winning majority. This ensures that candidates need to build broad appeal. A candidate who doubles down on an intense but ultimately narrow group of supporters cannot win.
If New York City adopts ranked-choice voting, it will join Eastpointe, Michigan, a Detroit suburb, as a fellow 2019 adoptee. Eastpointe agreed to switch to ranked-choice voting in June as a remedy for Voting Rights Act violations. The Department of Justice approved the new voting system as a way to help the cityâ€™s minority voters better elect their candidates of choice. According to the American Community Survey, the white population of Eastpointe is 48 percent, and the black population is 46 percent. Yet it wasnâ€™t until 2017 that the city elected its first black city council member, Monique Owens. This year, she was elected the cityâ€™s first black mayor.

Thereâ€™s more to come. 2020 is shaping up to be a big year for ranked-choice voting. Four states will use it in the Democratic primary â€” Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming. And Maine voters will use it for the first time in the general election for president. And both Alaska and Massachusetts will likely vote on ballot measures in 2020 to adopt ranked-choice voting statewide.
So ranked-choice voting is catching on. If New Yorkers vote themselves into the ranks, it will be yet another sign of the movementâ€™s momentum â€” and a growing desire among Americans to improve our political institutions.
Correction: An earlier version of this piece stated that the white population of Eastpointe, Michigan was 42 percent. According to the American Community Survey, it is actually 48 percent. We regret the error.

"Alicia Fleming had worked as a server at restaurants in Massachusetts for a decade and a half. She enjoyed the work, but after she had her son at the age of 32, she found it impossible to stay in the job.
â€œThe restaurant is looking at their bottom dollar,â€ Fleming said, â€œand wonâ€™t schedule you unless they absolutely need you. And then you donâ€™t know until a few days before whether or not youâ€™re even going to be asked to work.â€
The result was that â€” as a single parent without close family nearby â€” Fleming was often scrambling to find childcare. When she wasnâ€™t able to do so on short notice, sheâ€™d have to miss a shift. Her income fluctuated from week to week, and even though she was still employed at the restaurant, she was struggling to make ends meet.
Flemingâ€™s experience of an erratic work schedule is common, especially in sectors like restaurants and retail, where workers are often scheduled to work with only a few days or less of notice, are asked to stay late, or are sent home early from a shift. The result is a hectic life with volatile income, in which itâ€™s difficult to plan ahead for child care, doctorâ€™s appointments, or another part-time job (a necessity for many who are not offered full-time hours).
The number of people affected by unpredictable schedules is considerable: Over 9 million people work in food service and 16 million in retail, with estimates of one-third (and at least half of early career workers) receiving less than one week notice on schedules.
Policymakers are starting to pay attention to this problem. Over the past three years, Oregon and a wave of cities including Seattle, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York City have passed â€œfair workweekâ€ legislation that aims to make schedules more predictable (or compensate workers when they are unpredictable). The laws require that certain companies â€” most often, large retail and food service companies employing several hundred people or more â€” take steps such as posting schedules two weeks in advance, compensating workers if there are last-minute scheduling changes, and allowing sufficient rest time between shifts.
On November 5, Rep. Rosa DeLauro announced that she and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are re-introducing the Schedules That Work Act legislation, which calls for protections including two weeksâ€™ notice on schedules (with compensation for changes) for employees in food service, cleaning, hospitality, warehouse, and retail occupations.
Companies have pushed back against the new laws and, in some cases, have failed to comply with them. Meanwhile, advocates have argued that the costs to companies of giving more advance notice on schedules are minimal, and that following the new laws may actually improve profitability.
For workers, these laws are of huge importance. Both firsthand accounts and recent systematic research suggest that unpredictable scheduling is extremely stressful for workers and their families. Regardless of industry, people should have the ability to balance their family and work lives, and to plan ahead. By requiring advance notice (and compensation for last-minute changes), fair workweek scheduling can significantly raise quality of life for millions of people.
The toll that â€œjust-in-timeâ€ scheduling takes on workers
For the last several decades, many companies have shifted to â€œjust-in-timeâ€ scheduling, in which managers schedule shifts with little advance notice. A national survey in 2014 showed that 41 percent of early career workers with hourly wages reported seven days or fewer notice on their schedules. The rates in the food service and retail sectors are even higher, as is the rate for workers of color.
Workers often talk about the strain that involuntary unpredictable scheduling puts on their lives. Alicia Fleming recalls trying to make her shifts at the restaurant while scheduling child care last-minute as an incredibly stressful experience. â€œIt felt like all the time, I would think about the money I could make [if I could make the shifts], and what that could do for us, and then be really intent on trying to find somebody for child care,â€ she told me. (After nearly a year of searching, she managed to find a job with regular hours in office administration, and now works as an organizer for Massachusetts Jobs with Justice, a non-profit that advocates for worker rights.)
Recent large-scale surveys also show evidence of the toll that unpredictable scheduling takes on workers. Researchers Daniel Schneider at the University of California Berkeley and Kristen Harknett at the University of California San Francisco started The Shift Project in 2016 to survey workers at the biggest retail and food employers in the country. (The study is ongoing â€” as of this month, the authors said they have surveyed nearly 100,000 workers at almost 140 companies.)
In an article published this year, they write that of workers with high levels of scheduling instability â€” including short notice for shifts, canceled shifts, and â€œclopeningâ€ shifts (in which they work late until close, and then are back at work a few hours later at the storeâ€™s opening) â€” 70 percent reported psychological distress, compared to about 40 percent with more predictable schedules (the authors controlled for demographics and other differences like hourly wage in their analysis).
Unpredictable and unstable schedules also contribute to income volatility. In the US Financial Diaries, a research study tracking the incomes and expenses of hundreds of low- and moderate-income US households over the course of a year, researchers Jonathan Morduch at New York University and Rachel Schneider found that on average, households were making at least 25 percent above or below average monthly income for five months out of the year.
Volatile incomes can compound financial problems: a 2017 survey from the Federal Reserve Boardâ€™s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs showed that 40 percent of American families would have trouble coming up with $400 if needed in an emergency. The survey also showed that to come up with such a payment, some have to resort to selling assets or taking out high-interest loans.
How â€œfair workweekâ€ laws aim to make work more predictable
Fair workweek laws aim to make work more predictable for workers. Where there are scheduling changes with little notice, the laws often require companies to compensate them. Chicago is the latest major city to adopt a fair workweek statute, joining a handful of other cities and one state, Oregon. Other states, including Washington, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, are considering statewide legislation.
The laws most often apply to retail and restaurant employers with at least several hundred employees â€” though Chicago was the first city to also include health care workers. The laws vary to an extent, but most require employers to post schedules at least two weeks in advance, with compensation to workers if there are changes after that from the employerâ€™s side.
Some also require companies to offer workers additional shifts if they want to work more hours before hiring new employees, and to give good-faith estimates of minimum hours. Finally, some specify that workers be allowed to swap shifts with one another to increase flexibility, or to give input into their shift times, and require a minimum rest break between shifts to prevent employers from requiring workers to do â€œclopenings.â€
Most of the laws went into effect within the last year or two, or will go into effect in the next couple of years. At the federal level, the Schedules that Work Act, first introduced in 2015, has similar rules, including a requirement to give schedules two weeks in advance for employees of retail, cleaning, and food service companies (with compensation if shifts are changed last minute).
Erin, a 35-year-old in Seattle (who asked to be identified by first name only), has worked since 2014 as a server and then a barista with a large catering company, and said that the impact of the fair workweek law (or â€œsecure schedulingâ€ law as itâ€™s known there) in Seattle was dramatic. Before the law went into effect in 2017, they told me, managers often gave little notice. â€œI was getting text messages the night before as to when I would be going into work the next day.â€ This last-minute scheduling was stressful and chaotic, and they said that it was difficult to sleep sometimes, not knowing whether to go to work hours later.
After the law changed, the company shifted to giving a two-week notice on schedules as required, and offering extra compensation if any changes took place on shorter notice than that. â€œStress levels went down [in the workplace], and it was a palpable shift,â€ Erin said.
Advocacy groups in the state including Working Washington are now pushing for statewide legislation, and earlier this year Erin testified in the Washington State Legislature about the importance of the legislation. For Erin, who commutes an hour to Seattle for the job, it would be preferable to find a job closer to home â€” but until the secure scheduling law is statewide, looking for a job outside of Seattle is too risky: â€œI really wouldnâ€™t want to go back to an unpredictable schedule,â€ they said.
Research studies about the impacts of the new laws are starting to emerge. Anna Gassman-Pines at Duke University and Elizabeth Ananat at Columbia University conducted a small study of parents of young children in Emeryville, CA, in which they compared predictability of schedules before and after the 2017 fair workweek law (using companies that were not covered by the law as a control group). Workers at covered companies reported that their schedules improved â€” with a 35 percent reduction in instability (such as cancelled shifts or changed hours) â€” as did their sleep quality and levels of stress, compared to no change for workers in the uncovered companies. (Similar studies in Seattle and New York City are underway, though results are not yet publicly available.)
A fight to get companies to follow the new laws
One of the big questions is how well companies will comply with the new laws. Rachel Deutsch at the Fair Workweek Initiative â€” a collaborative project led by the non-profits Center for Popular Democracy (for which Deutsch works as supervising attorney of worker justice), CPD Action, and United for Respect â€” told me that itâ€™s too early to draw any firm conclusions. â€œOne [reason] is that with any new law, there is a gradual adjustment of employment practices,â€ she said.
Susan Lambert, a researcher at the University of Chicago who has long studied scheduling practices and management decisions, said that a big hurdle is that managers have to learn what the new law entails and how to follow it, and this can take time. But another issue, she told me, is the incentives that many companies now have in place for managers: companies give frontline managers budgets for labor hours, along with projected sales numbers â€” and the way that managers often try to ensure that they are meeting these metrics is by last-minute adjustments to employeesâ€™ schedules.
But there are big problems with this model, Lambert said, not just for workers but also for companies themselves. Unpredictability leads to higher employee turnover, she said, which can be costly â€” but, she said, â€œcompanies donâ€™t hold managers responsible for turnover.â€
Not only that, but companies would also likely have better sales if they treated employees better, Lambert said. (Researcher Zeynep Ton also argues as much in her book The Good Jobs Strategy.) Lambert and colleagues recently conducted a study at Gap stores â€” in stores that randomly encouraged managers to make scheduling more predictable and stable, productivity went up by 5 percent and sales increased by 7 percent.
Lambert and Deutsch say that changing the model at retail and restaurant chains will take both an internal change within companies as well as government enforcement. But government enforcement agencies often rely on workers at companies to file complaints about violations, they said, putting a big burden on workers who are often already in precarious situations.
In New York City, in spite of the risk of retaliation from their employer, some fast food workers have boldly stepped forward to report on companies that have failed to comply with the 2017 fair workweek law.
Jeremy Espinal, a 20-year-old college student in NYC, told me that he and his coworkers experienced unpredictable and last-minute schedules at Chipotle (without any compensation for scheduling changes, as the law requires) since he started working there in early 2018. Espinal described how unpredictable schedules made it difficult for him to continue with his college degree, and made life difficult for his coworkers with children and additional part-time jobs.
In May 2019, with the support of a local union 32BJ SEIU (which also supported workers in pushing for the $15 per hour minimum wage and the fair workweek law itself), Espinal led a group of 20 of his coworkers to sign a petition which they delivered to a manager at their store.
Chipotle workers at over a dozen restaurants also lodged complaints with the city, which filed a lawsuit against the company in September. Now the city is seeking $1 million in restitution to workers at five Chipotle locations, plus fines (and another 11 Chipotle branches in NYC are still under investigation).
Laurie Schalow, Chipotleâ€™s chief reputation officer, commented by email: â€œWith respect to the Fair Workweek Law, Chipotle has been working cooperatively with the city to ensure we have systems and processes in place to comply with the law, so we believe the filing of charges was unnecessary. Regardless, we will continue to cooperate with the city and we are addressing any prior noncompliance concerns.â€
As more and more cities adopt these laws, the prospects for workers certainly seem to be improving. But as Espinal notes, the fight isnâ€™t over. â€œIâ€™m going to keep organizing,â€ he said.

"On November 5, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood has a good shot at becoming the stateâ€™s first Democratic governor in 16 years â€” as long as a Jim Crow-era electoral system doesnâ€™t get in his way.
Neither Hood nor his Republican opponent, current Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, has ever lost a statewide election â€” Hood was first elected as Mississippiâ€™s attorney general in 2003; in that same election, Reeves became the stateâ€™s treasurer.
The race is expected to be very, very close. Early polls showed Hood with a slight advantage, one that fell from 6 percentage points last December to 2 percentage points in February. The latest Mason-Dixon poll, taken by phone in October, found Reeves ahead by 3 percentage points. In late September, the Cook Political Report marked the race as leaning Republican.

But the race has always been an uphill battle for Hood, for a few reasons. One is a basic political reality: Mississippi tends to be fairly Republican. The state is currently controlled by Republicans, including Reeves, and President Donald Trump won the state by more than 17 percentage points in 2016.
Hoodâ€™s greatest challenge, however, is institutional: a Jim Crow era constitution designed to, in the words of one of Mississippiâ€™s Reconstruction era governors, â€œeliminate the n****r from politics.â€
Hood isnâ€™t black â€” both candidates are middle-aged white men â€” but the laws that were put in place are meant to put a high bar for winning statewide office.
As Voxâ€™s Ian Millhiser has explained, that constitution says that to win statewide office in Mississippi, a candidate must both win the popular vote and the majority of the stateâ€™s House of Representative districts. If no candidate wins both, the stateâ€™s House of Representatives chooses who will fill the role. A lawsuit has been filed challenging that system, but a ruling on it isnâ€™t expected until after the 2019 election.
The stakes of the race are quite high, particularly with respect to Medicaid. Hood is for enacting a Medicaid expansion that would â€” by his campaignâ€™s estimate â€” lead to almost 100,000 Mississippians gaining insurance. Reeves, however, has said he staunchly opposes any expansion â€œon philosophical grounds.â€
Education, economic growth, and infrastructure have also been fiercely debated topics, but both candidates have worked to nationalize the race. Reeves claims, â€œThe Democrats are out-of-control and Jim Hood is completely with them.â€ Hood, on the other hand, has rejected any ties to progressives in DC, saying, â€œThe crazies on both extremes of our parties have been driving the agenda, and people are sick of it.â€
The specter of these politicians â€” particularly Trump â€” looms large, and Dallas Breen, executive director of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University believes the national attention the race has received in recent weeks could be behind the polling shift in Reeveâ€™s favor, especially â€œthe attention that the president is giving to the state.â€
But while the race currently favors Reeves by the slimmest of margins, Hood is as strong a challenger as the Democrats have put up in nearly a generation. So the race really could go either way. Vox is covering the results live, here.
Hood is a strong candidate because he seems a lot like a Republican
Tate Reeves claims Jim Hood is â€œa liberal Democrat, he has been for 16 years, he continues to be.â€
While it is true Hoodâ€™s tenure as attorney general has been marked by work that has been celebrated by liberals, like the reopening of civil rights cases and suing large corporations, itâ€™s quite a stretch to call him a â€œliberal Democrat.â€

Over the course of his career, the attorney general has leaned heavily into his conservative image â€” he makes his faith known, citing the Bible; talks about his guns; and has defended both his stateâ€™s abortion law that bans the procedure as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, and its ban on adoption by members of the LGBTQ community.
â€œI reload guns. Iâ€™m pro-life. People have seen my record for 16 years, so it gives a comfort level to Republicans to cross over,â€ he said in September.
Many Republicans did indeed cross over to vote for him in previous elections. Seven out of eight statewide officials are Republicans in Mississippi â€” the only one who is not is Jim Hood, which has led to his nickname as the â€œlast Democrat in Dixie.â€
During the 2015 attorney generalâ€™s race, Hoodâ€™s opponent Mike Hurst told Reuters, â€œA lot of folks are unaware that he is a Democrat. ... He has done a great job, I think personally, of fooling the Mississippi voters into thinking that he is conservative.â€
Positioning himself as a conservative has been a successful strategy for Hood, but it is also one that has left some of his fellow Democrats out in the cold, particularly during this election cycle.
Mississippian Anna McInarnay, who describes herself as a liberal, lamented to the Wall Street Journal, â€œOur choices are between a conservative and a somewhat conservative.â€
Reeves, of course, hopes that most people donâ€™t share McInarnayâ€™s view. To further the case for a Gov. Reeves, he has endeavored to convince voters that he is the raceâ€™s only true conservative when it comes to the economy.
Reeves sometimes refers to himself as Mississippiâ€™s â€œfiscal watchdog,â€ and he has used his tenure as lieutenant governor to push for lower taxes.
Reeves â€” and all Mississippi lieutenant governors â€” are able to directly influence policy through powers granted in lawsuits brought in the late 1980s and early 1990s that gave lieutenant governors not just the power to preside over the Senate as Mississippiâ€™s constitution outlines, but to appoint committee chairs and members and to assign bills to committees for review.
Reeves has used that power, appointing committee chairs and ushering in a law that fulfilled a campaign promise to lower taxes, 2016â€™s Taxpayer Pay Raise Act.
Ahead of that billâ€™s passage, Reeves argued, â€œWe need to put tax policy in place thatâ€™s going to encourage and incentivize long-term job growth.â€
In the gubernatorial campaign, he has used it to tie himself to President Trump, tweeting, â€œI believe in low taxes. I agree with Donald Trump that tax cuts are good for the economy.â€
Critics of the bill â€” as well as the roughly 50 other tax cuts that have been rolled out under Reevesâ€™ tenure â€” argue that like the presidentâ€™s signature tax cut, the Mississippi cuts benefit businesses more than citizens and that a loss of revenue has put strain on the stateâ€™s finances.
Reeves told Mississippi Today â€œall of these cuts generate more economic activity in Mississippi. More economic activity leads to better jobs, more taxpayers, and ultimately, more revenue collected.â€
This where Reeves and Hoodâ€™s conservatism diverges, to some degree. Hood also wants to cut taxes, but wants to do so for consumer goods, most notably groceries. Reeves, on the other hand, believes lowering taxes that affect businesses is more useful.
What clearly makes Hood a Democrat, however, is Medicaid.
The fate of a Mississippi Medicaid expansion is in votersâ€™ hands
Mississippi is one of the 14 states that has refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Those statesâ€™ decision to reject the expansion has had very real consequences, as Voxâ€™s Matthew Yglesias has written:
A recent study from four researchers â€” University of Michigan economist Sarah Miller; University of California, Los Angeles public health scholar Laura Wherry; National Institutes of Healthâ€™s Sean Altekruse; and Norman Johnson with the US Census Bureau â€” estimates that failure to expand Medicaid leads to about 15,600 extra deaths per year just among people ages 55-64.
But Republican leaders in Mississippi have argued that the cost sharing proposed under Obamacare is too risky to accept.
Essentially, the ACA asks states that expand Medicaid (but that didnâ€™t do so before 2016) to pay a percentage of the costs created by that expansion. Any state that joins in 2020 or after will be asked to pay 10 percent; the federal government is meant to pay the other 90 percent.
But state lawmakers opposed to that agreement in Mississippi and elsewhere have argued the federal government may change its mind, and if it starts paying less, states will be left with huge health care costs they can ill afford. (Republicans at the federal level have tried to do just that, so the fear isnâ€™t completely without merit.)
And Reeves has little interest in changing that position, as he has made very clear.
â€œI am opposed to Obamacare expansion in Mississippi. I am opposed to Obamacare expansion in Mississippi. I am opposed to Obamacare expansion in Mississippi,â€ he said during a January luncheon.
In June, Reeves told the Clarion Ledger, â€œI donâ€™t believe the expansion is nearly as good a financial deal as some would make it out to be.â€
And he has summed up his position on Medicaid and similar programs as â€œMississippians believe the way to a better future is not through handouts or bailouts but through hard work and more freedom.â€
Hood takes the opposing view, and has framed rejecting the expansion as saying â€œnoâ€ to free money. â€œWe shouldnâ€™t leave hundreds of millions of federal dollars on the table,â€ he said during his announcement speech.
On his campaign site, Hood claims, â€œIn Mississippi, around 300,000 adults would benefit from reforming Medicaidâ€”nearly 100,000 of those individuals live in poverty without health insurance.â€

He has often mentioned an emergency room that closed in Houston, Mississippi, and has acknowledged that a number of hospitals, particularly those in rural parts of the state are facing difficult times â€” Reevesâ€™s primary opponent, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller, put the number in danger of closing at 31. Expanding Medicaid, Hood said, would â€œkeep those hospitals open, because those are the best paying jobs in most rural communities like mine.â€
Hood has not specifically outlined a plan for paying for the expansion, which a 2015 Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning study found would cost the state between $100 and $150 million per year (should the federal funding commitment remain at 90 percent). He has, however, said he has positive feelings about a plan drafted by a group of Mississippi hospitals that suggests paying for the expansion through hospital and patient fees.
If Reeves becomes governor there will be no Medicaid expansion. But it isnâ€™t clear whether there would be one under a Hood administration, either.
He would try, but given that the House and Senate are both Republican controlled (and they are expected to remain so following the election), Breen told Vox an expansion would be a â€œtough sell.â€
It wouldnâ€™t necessarily be a nonstarter, however: â€œI would think there would at least be discussion on it,â€ Breen said. â€œI think youâ€™d have a very deliberate process.â€
Who is going to win?
Voters clearly like both Hood and Reeves â€” theyâ€™ve each been elected, often by large margins, four times. They are known quantities. The question is which voters like better for governor, and itâ€™s a difficult question to answer.
â€œIf itâ€™s about policy, Jimâ€™s in trouble. If itâ€™s about personality, Tateâ€™s in trouble,â€ a Republican strategist told the Cook Political Report.
The race has been about policy â€” particularly Medicaid â€” and it has been about personality, but it has also been about avoiding a situation in which the House of Representatives decides the governor. Hood has reason to be concerned about that happening because the House is full of Republicans; Reeves because most of those lawmakers have said theyâ€™ll vote as their district did.
Like other Democratic victories in the South, black voters will an important element of this effort. The state is 38 percent black, so Hood would obviously need a coalition that spans ethnicity to win, because the support of black voters will only go so far. But those voters become even more of a factor when considering the 122 House districts in Mississippi.
Breen told Vox 39 of those districts are majority minority. All of those districts, and five others, are traditionally Democratic strongholds. Hood would need every one, but winning all of those would bring him to 44 districts. He needs at least 62, a difficult feat, but perhaps doable if he is able to repeat the sorts of performances he has put on during past elections.
And those Republican districts are not necessarily locks for Reeves, either, according to Breen, who said there are still a fair number of undecided voters and Republicans who still wish former Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller had defeated Reeves in the GOP gubernatorial runoff. Who those Waller supporters choose to vote for could have a major impact on the election.
Less than a week out from voting, Breen said, â€œThereâ€™s a population of people trying to decide what the next step is for them.â€
Overall, Reeves has leaned into Donald Trumpâ€™s popularity, telling supporters at a rally hosted by Donald Trump Jr., â€œWeâ€™re gonna run this state like Donald J. Trump is running America.â€ Donald Jr. promised Reeves â€œwill fight for the MAGA agenda,â€ and both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have stumped for Reeves in person by election day.

Breen said all this presidential attention has energized Democrats as well: â€œComing down for a rally in north Mississippi at the end of the week, I think thatâ€™s getting some people who may not have gone to the polls to show some interest â€” or some excitement â€” towards going to the polls, in both directions.â€
Voters have also been asked to contend with a number of scandals brought up by each side. Both Reeves and Hood have faced questions about the use of blackface at their college fraternities. No pictures exist of either man directly partaking in the racist ritual, and Hood told voters at a town hall heâ€™d never wear blackface because, â€œWhen I go hunting, I donâ€™t even like to wear a mask.â€
There have also been accusations of abuse of power â€” Hood claiming Reeves used his office to try to get a road built directly from his subdevelopment to a shopping center; Reeves claiming Hood wasted taxpayer money investigating the effort.
None of these scandals have affected the race much, according to Breen. Voters, he said, are focused more on Medicaid, infrastructure, and education. Both sides are accusing the other of wrongdoing only as a desperate measure, he said, because this has not been â€œan easy election for one side or the other.â€
â€œThis one has a unique feel to it,â€ Breen said. â€œI think itâ€™s going to be close.â€"
"Kentucky Republican Matt Bevin has the distinct reputation of being among the countryâ€™s most unpopular governors. On November 5, 2019, Bevin is up for reelection, and the race is a total toss-up.
Democrats are banking on Kentuckyâ€™s Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear to unseat him. Earlier this year Beshear, who has out-fundraised and out-spent Bevin, led in the polls, but going into Election Day the two are in a dead heat; a mid-October Mason Dixon Line poll showed 46 percent of likely voters backing Bevin, and 46 percent backing Beshear.
In many ways, this race shouldnâ€™t be this close. Republicans have supermajorities in both of Kentuckyâ€™s state legislative chambers, and President Donald Trumpâ€™s popularity in the state is unwavering. (He won the state by 30 points.) Itâ€™s home to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and all but one of the stateâ€™s six House members are Republicans. Democrats had a high profile loss in the state just last year, when top recruit Marine Lt. Col. Amy McGrath failed to unseat Rep. Andy Barr. (McGrath is now challenging McConnell in 2020.)

But in the last four years, Bevin, who won handily by 9 points in 2015, has picked political fights that many voters may carry with with them to the polls. The Republican governor is fighting to push people off Medicaid and cut back teachersâ€™ pensions. Bevin famously said protesting teachers had a â€œthug mentality,â€ were â€œselfish,â€ and â€œignorant.â€
â€œWhat Bevin has done is that he has gotten into these personal wars with average people,â€ Jessica Taylor, an editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said. â€œHeâ€™s just someone who doesnâ€™t play well with others.â€
Bevinâ€™s threat to end Medicaid expansion in the state could throw hundreds of thousands of people off their health care, heâ€™s already signed restrictive abortion bills and pushed for serious budget cuts in a state home to some of the United Statesâ€™ poorest people.
Republicans know Bevin is at risk of losing. Trump held a rally in Kentucky the night before Election Day, and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for the governor on the ground. Meanwhile, Beshear, who has spent the last four years fighting Bevin from within the stateâ€™s executive branch as attorney general, is hoping voters will ditch their national political allegiances in an off-year election.

Vox is covering the results live, here.
The race is being cast as a referendum on Trump; can a Democrat win in a deep-red state one year from a presidential election? But Kentuckyâ€™s governorâ€™s race is better described as a test of Trumpâ€™s influence over Republicans. Is love for Trump enough to overpower a strong distaste for a state leader?
Republicans want this race to be about Trump
Trump is popular in Kentucky. Bevin is not. Republicans know this: If Bevin wins it will be because his push to make the race about Trump was successful.
â€œThe basic contours are pretty simple, Republicans want to nationalize the race, make Bevin into Trump and make Andy Beshear into your standard radical Democrat,â€ Scott Jennings, a Kentucky Republican strategist and commentator said. If the governorâ€™s race becomes â€œa shirts versus skins exerciseâ€ about Trump, Jennings said, then Republicans have more people on their team.
Bevin is leaning into that strategy, explicitly. He talks about Trump on the campaign trail. Trump is prominently featured in his campaign ads â€” ads focused on the â€œthreatâ€ of illegal immigration. Trump himself is coming to Kentucky to campaign for Bevin the day for Tuesdayâ€™s election, to energize the base to get to the polls.
Itâ€™s easy to see how this could work. Particularly as Democrats escalate their impeachment inquiry, turning Bevin into Trumpâ€™s Kentucky defender is likely to rally Republicans in a state where the presidentâ€™s approval rating has been consistently high.
But Kentucky also has a strong Democratic history that Beshear is a part of. Beshearâ€™s father, Steve Beshear, served two four-year terms as governor ( from 2007 through 2015). Even as President Barack Obamaâ€™s status in the state tanked, the Beshear name remained in Kentuckiansâ€™ good graces.

â€œIf who occupies the White House was going to determine who occupies the governorâ€™s mansion in Frankfort, the state has pretty well disproved that,â€ says Matt Erwin, a Democratic strategist that worked on Adam Edelenâ€™s gubernatorial campaign, who lost to Beshear in the primary, running to his left. â€œItâ€™s definitely a factor, but itâ€™s not the only factor.â€
But Andy Beshear is not his father, who was seen as a natural, homespun, retail politician. Interviews with Republican and Democratic strategists and neutral observers pegged Beshear as â€œcerebral,â€ â€œmilquetoast,â€ and â€œnot a very compellingâ€ candidate. That said, Beshear has shown he has a formidable fundraising operation, and has so far kept his campaign away from the national spotlight.
Beshearâ€™s message isnâ€™t about Washington, DC, or Trump, but about Bevin. In the gubernatorial debates Beshear emphasized Bevin calling teachers names. His ads have been about the opioid crisis and health care. Heâ€™s responded to Bevinâ€™s ads about immigration by citing his endorsement from the Fraternal Order of the Police. And that all seems to have Republicans worried.
â€œBevin clearly knows this race is close,â€ Al Cross, a University of Kentucky professor and political commentator, said. â€œHeâ€™s bringing in Trump to close the sale. You donâ€™t pull out stops like this if you think youâ€™ve got it wrapped up.â€
The stakes are high for Democrats
Kentucky Democrats, like Beshear, hold some statewide seats. The stateâ€™s secretary of state, Alison Grimes, is also a Democrat, though she is not running for reelection. Her father was convicted of illegally funneling her money for her 2014 run against McConnell, and she herself came under scrutiny for breaching state employeeâ€™s voting privacy.
But Democrats have been overshadowed by a staunchly conservative state legislature with supermajorities in both chambers, and a powerful Republican-heavy congressional delegation.
Under Bevinâ€™s leadership, the state has passed conservative labor laws, like a â€œright to workâ€ policy to undercut unions, and a repeal of the prevailing wage, which guaranteed public works employees base salaries. He has allowed charter schools to come to Kentucky while proposing cuts to public school. And heâ€™s also signed several anti-abortion laws, like requiring ultrasounds and showing patients pictures of fetuses before performing an abortion.
Democrats see this race as a must-win situation.

â€œWe are a poor, largely rural state that in far too many places is too sick and too lacking in education and opportunity to keep doubling down on policies and programs that arenâ€™t going to give us a chance to succeed in the future,â€ Erwin, the Kentucky Democratic strategist, said. â€œWe have to say we can look at Kansas and say those policies donâ€™t work. ... This state will not survive a failed political science experiment where we see what happens if we shrink government.â€
That said, even if Beshear is to win, he would still face an uphill battle in a state that gives the legislature power to override vetoes with a simple majority.
Will a 2018 messaging redux work in Kentucky?
The messaging wars in Kentucky are familiar. According to an analysis from NBC, 86 percent of all ad spending the Kentucky gubernatorial race has been focused on health care and immigration â€” a rehashing of the 2018 midterms.
Bevin is using the same script Republicans used nationwide last year: fear-mongering images of the MS-13 gang members and migrants climbing over a wall, he is labeling Beshear as a â€œpro-illegals liberalâ€ and himself â€œpro-Trump.â€
Beshear, meanwhile, has emphasized the reasons Kentuckians really donâ€™t like Bevin. Much of that comes down to Kentuckyâ€™s vastly underfunded pension system, one that since 2000 has accumulated $43 billion in debt. Bevin pushed a reform that cut pensions for new teachers and funding for public schools, resulting in big teacher protests. Earlier this year, Kentucky teachers called in sick en masse shutting down every single public school in the state.
In response, Bevin called teachers â€œignorantâ€ and â€œselfish,â€ and said kids were likely exposed to sexual assault because teachers were protesting instead of staying in the classrooms, a comment he eventually apologized for, but not without saying teachers were acting like â€œthugs.â€ Beshear is promising teachers raises, and new funding streams for the pension system â€” proposals Bevin attacks as unfeasible.
Democrats have also been focusing on health care, namely claiming that Bevin is â€œtrying to take health care awayâ€ from families. Beshearâ€™s father expanded Medicaid in Kentucky as governor under the Affordable Care Act to roughly 400,000 people. Itâ€™s been an incredibly popular program, covering 1.2 million people in the state.
Bevin has threatened to end Medicaid expansion in his push to implement work requirements, premiums, and co-payments for the stateâ€™s most vulnerable population. As Dylan Scott explained for Vox, thereâ€™s a lot of evidence that most Medicaid recipients do work, and many could still lose their coverage because the requirements arenâ€™t structured to address the irregularities of low-income work.
Beshearâ€™s ads have been on preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, and affordability.
This messaging war helped House Democrats sweep the majority in the 2018 midterms, and unseated Republican leaders in states like Wisconsin, Arizona, and Michigan, where a weakening of traditionally conservative suburban pockets delivered Democrats wins.
But that formula didnâ€™t play out as well in Kentucky. Democrat Amy McGrath failed to unseat a House Republican in Lexington, Kentucky. And while Democrats in the state see potential in some of the suburbs around Louisville, where Kentucky House Republicans in Jefferson County lost two of their five seats, Republicans easily held on to their strong majorities in the state legislature in 2018.
It comes down to turnout: Will Republicans stay home with Bevin on the ballot, and will Democrats be energized to oust an unpopular Republican?
â€œBoth parties think they are going to win; both parties wouldnâ€™t bet the farm on it, but turnout projections are all over the board,â€ Jennings said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Steve Beshear served three terms as governor. He served two, and one term as lieutenant governor in the 1980s. We regret the error."
"Dozens of Iraqi protesters rushed the Iranian consulate on Sunday in the city of Karbala, where they tried to scale and set fire to the outer walls.
The protesters brought Iraqi flags to hang on the consulate, according to reports. It was a symbol of defiance against Tehran, as protesters reject Iranâ€™s growing influence in Iraqi politics. That frustration, and disillusionment over the Iraqi political system, is fueling the months-long protests in cities like Baghdad and Nasiriyah and other majority-Shia cities in the south of Iraq.
At least three people were killed in Karbala, reportedly by security forces, as demonstrators stormed the consulate building. And in Baghdad, Iraqâ€™s capital, at least five people died after clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces. Reports say security forces opened fire on the demonstrators, who tried to charge into Baghdadâ€™s Green Zone, where the government buildings are headquartered.
The unrest in Iraq began in early October, with Iraqis protesting the lack of job opportunities and high unemployment, and what they saw as the governmentâ€™s inability to deliver basic services, like electricity, and repair badly damaged infrastructure. These socioeconomic grievances morphed into larger anti-corruption protests. Anger over the Iraqi governmentâ€™s incompetence and lack of accountability has also fueled Iraqisâ€™ anger toward Iran, which demonstrators feel has outsized control over Iraqâ€™s politicians and domestic affairs.
The Iraqi protests are now entering their second month, and have intensified in the past two weeks. At least 250 Iraqi protesters have been killed, and many blame the government and the security forces (some of which also have ties to Iran) for the violence. Protesters are now demanding a sweeping overhaul of the countryâ€™s political system, which has been in place since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. Their frustration is trained on political elites, whom they see benefiting from the system at the expense of ordinary Iraqis.
Iraqi President Barham Salih has said he will draft a new electoral law designed to take away some of the power from political factions, and when passed, will allow for new elections. He has also said Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi would resign once a replacement is selected, but itâ€™s not clear if he actually will step aside, or whether Iran will let him. And even if he does, it might do little to remedy the frustration thatâ€™s spilled over in these weeks of protest.
The unrest in Iraq looks unlikely to stop anytime soon. â€œItâ€™s really a fork in the road,â€ Bilal Wahab, an Iraqi politics expert and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies, said of the protests. The pressure of the protests could force the government to make political reforms. â€œOr theyâ€™re going to say â€” especially if Iranâ€™s influence were to gain the upper hand here â€” letâ€™s do it the Iran way and letâ€™s crackdown on the protesters,â€ he added.
The protests, then, are unlikely to fade quietly. But whether protesters will achieve their demands also remains uncertain.
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what sparked the protests in Iraq, whatâ€™s happening now, and what could happen next.
How the Iraqi protests began
On October 1, Iraqi anti-government protests erupted in Baghdad. Protesters were drawn to the streets over high unemployment, lack of basic services, and the countryâ€™s crumbling and damaged infrastructure, much of which still hasnâ€™t been rebuilt in the 16 years since the US-led invasion and in the two years after the Iraqi government declared the Islamic State defeated.
The demonstrators â€” which, at first, were largely young and male â€” blamed the Iraqi government for these failures.
Though the protests erupted quickly, the discontent with the Iraqi government has been percolating for years. Demonstrations against the government had happened over the past few years but didnâ€™t really materialize into a sustained protest movement.
But a few things may have helped ignite the most recent uprising. PhD and Masterâ€™s students had spent weeks peacefully protesting unemployment and lack of job opportunities outside some of Baghdadâ€™s government buildings, and video of demonstrators being dispersed by water cannons in late September drew a lot of attention to the governmentâ€™s heavy-handed tactics.
Then, the Iraqi government announced in late September that it was demoting a popular Iraqi military leader. Staff Lieutenant General Abdulwahab al-Saadi was a leader in Iraqâ€™s Counter-Terrorism Service, which helped retake Mosul from ISIS and defeat the terror group in the country. Saadi is a broadly popular figure in Iraq for his role in defeating the terror group, and his unjustified demotion â€” to an underwhelming desk job in Iraqâ€™s defense ministry â€” was seen as a huge insult.
Many speculated that Iran was the reason he was sidelined, since Saadi worked closely with the US (and Saudi Arabia). The diminishing of a national hero infuriated Iraqis. In the early days of the protests, demonstrators held up posters of Saadi and supporters protested on Twitter with the hashtag â€œwe are all Saadi.â€
As the protests escalated that first week of October, Iraqi security forces cracked down aggressively; dozens of protesters were killed and scores injured. Security services used water cannons, tear gas, and live ammunition to clear the demonstrators. Authorities also instituted an internet blackout in certain regions to prevent people from organizing on social media and imposed a curfew in Baghdad to keep people off the streets.
â€œWe want the very basic rights: Electricity, water, employment, and medicine, and nothing else,â€ Mohammed Jassim, a protester, told the Associated Press after the October 1 demonstrations. â€œBut this government is shooting at the crowd.â€
The crackdown intensified and broadened the protests beyond Baghdad. In the first week of protests, about 150 were killed and thousands wounded. The aggressive response of the security forces â€” and the governmentâ€™s deflection of blame for any role in it â€” personified the frustration that the Iraqi government was both corrupt and wholly indifferent to its citizensâ€™ demands. And the outrage turned from simple anti-government protests to calls for reforming the entire Iraqi political system.
â€œThe protestersâ€™ demands became more maximalist, they asked for changing the political system, changing the election laws, having fresh elections, asking the government to resign,â€ Wahab said. â€œSo all of this is brewing, but in parallel to this, the question of brutality, the question of killing protesters, also started to drive a desire, or call for justice.â€
There was a two-week lull in the protests, but they started again in earnest around October 25 and have sustained themselves ever since. Theyâ€™ve also put even more pressure on the Iraqi government â€” and have increasingly challenged Iranâ€™s influence.
People are rejecting Iraqâ€™s political system and Iranâ€™s fingerprints
These protests in Iraq in recent weeks have been some of the largest in years. Demonstrators have flocked to Baghdadâ€™s Tahrir Square and protesters have shut down roads and schools in the city. Over the weekend, demonstrators blocked a highway leading to a critical port near Basra. Dozens and dozens of protesters have been killed since the protests started up again at the end of October.
Most of the protests are raging in Shia-majority towns in the southern part of Iraq. But they are not sectarian demonstrations; instead, this is a show of Iraqi nationalism. â€œWe want a country,â€ is among the slogans protesters chant.
The protesters are demanding the total remaking of the Iraqi government. After the US-led invasion in 2003 and the fall of Saddam Hussein, the US helped create an Iraqi government that worked along sectarian lines to represent the Shia, Sunnis, and Kurds. The government is Shia-led but, at least in the protestersâ€™ eyes now, the current system empowers political factions and makes individual politicians less accountable,
And the political class has benefitted as the rest of Iraq has suffered. Corruption permeates every level of government, and officials largely act with impunity. Political leaders benefit from lucrative patronage networks. According to Haaretz, $450 billion in oil revenues that should have gone back to the state has gone missing, most likely into the pockets of political elites and their cronies.
As Iraqis deal with electricity shortages and cities still in ruins, theyâ€™re directly linking that political corruption with their own worsening situations.
â€œThis is reaction to 16 years of system failure,â€ Fanar Haddad, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told me. â€œThe sense that this is a political system that has cohered that robs the many for the services of the few and those with connections to the few.â€
And then thereâ€™s Iran, which has increased its influence and control over many of the Shia-led political networks in Iraq. Especially as US influenced has waned, Tehranâ€™s clout has grown and demonstrators see politicians and many Shia militia groups as beholden to the Iranian government. In some respects, the grievances against Iranian meddling are a byproduct of the larger frustration with the Iraqi governmentâ€™s incompetence â€” and the sense that Iraqi politicians are beholden to just about everyone else but the Iraqi people.
The Iraqi government is trying to respond. It may be too little, too late.
The Iraqi governmentâ€™s response to the protesters has been disjointed. While Iraqi leaders have met with protesters and even promised to increase funding for certain services, the harsh responses of the security forces and internet blackouts have diminished some of the Iraqi governmentâ€™s commitments.
When the protests began in early October, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said that the protesters had legitimate concerns but that there was no â€œmagical formulaâ€ to solving Iraqâ€™s problems. He did issue a reform plan that included more subsidies to the poor and educational and job training, according to Al Jazeera.
But after the protests resumed in late October, the Iraqi government is under even more pressure. On October 31, Iraqi President Barham Salih, in a televised address, promised electoral reforms that would make the government more representative and break up some of those political factions tied to Iran. Salih also promised other judicial and governmental reforms, saying that once they were passed, heâ€™d call for new elections.
Salih also said that Mahdi, the prime minister, would resign â€” at least until a replacement is agreed upon. The prime minister has the most power in Iraq, and the office is traditionally held by a Shia. Mahdi was chosen as a compromise candidate from competing Shia factions last year after a deadlocked election but wasnâ€™t directly elected. Some of those powerful Shia factions that first backed him for the job have also turned against him and have been calling for his ouster in the wake of the unrest.
But then, according to reports, Iran intervened, asking those factions to stop trying to push him out. Reuters said the intervention came directly from Qassem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guardsâ€™ Quds Force, which backs militias in Iraq and other places across the region.
Mahdi, speaking on Sunday, told the protesters to cease the unrest, which is hurting the economy. But he didnâ€™t mention anything about his possible resignation.
Mahdiâ€™s resignation might be a win for the protesters, and if Iran really did intervene, itâ€™s only like to enrage the demonstrators more, who are directly challenging this type of influence.
At the same time, the electoral reforms and new elections the Iraqi government are promising are long-term solutions. The Iraqi protesters, fed up and furious, want immediate and sweeping change, including the removal of the current political class and changes to the constitution.
â€œThey donâ€™t realize that this time itâ€™s a revolution,â€ a protester told the Washington Post. â€œAnd we will stay here until we get rid of all of them â€” Abdul Mahdi, Salih, and the whole parliament.â€
And thatâ€™s the dilemma in Iraq, that â€œfork in the roadâ€ itâ€™s now facing. Whether the Iraqi government can actually put forward â€” and implement â€” solutions that will appease protesters and address their demands, or if it will instead become even more aggressive in trying to break up these protests."
"xIn the almost three years since President Donald Trump took office, the US asylum system has almost become unrecognizable.
The administration has built up, layer by layer, a series of impediments in Central America, at the border, in detention centers, and in the immigration courts that have made obtaining asylum nearly impossible.
The changes have been made quietly and have never been able to inspire the kind of public outrage sparked by Trumpâ€™s travel ban in January 2017 â€” when thousands of people flooded airports to stand up for people barred from entering the US â€” or the outrage toward the â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy that led to family separation in spring 2018.
Trump ultimately backed down on separating families in immigration detention. But the policy was only one piece of a much broader, concerted effort to stymie asylum seekers orchestrated by White House senior adviser Stephen Miller â€” who, despite retreating from public view while Trump has been in office, has been instrumental in implementing policies that immigration restrictionists have long sought.

â€œMy mantra has persistently been presenting aliens with multiple unsolvable dilemmas to impact their calculus for choosing to make the arduous journey to begin with,â€ he told US Customs and Border Protection officials in a memo first reported by NBC.
Migrants have the right to pursue asylum in the US if they have â€œcredible fearâ€ of persecution in their home countries on account of their race, religion, nationality, political opinions, or membership in a â€œparticular social group,â€ such as a tribe or ethnic group. Once they are granted asylum, they can obtain social services through refugee resettlement agencies and apply for a green card one year later.
Historically, most asylum seekers apprehended while trying to cross the southern border would have been placed into deportation proceedings, but released into the US while awaiting a decision on their immigration cases. Under the Trump administration, that changed dramatically.
â€œWhat we have seen, unlike any other administration, is a series of measures that are interlocking,â€ Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Instituteâ€™s office at New York University School of Law, said. â€œWhen you look at the combination of these interlocking mechanisms, we have essentially revised â€” some people would say gutted â€” our modern asylum system as we know it.â€
Trump promised on the campaign trail to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. While that plan hasnâ€™t exactly come to fruition, Trumpâ€™s policies are, with the cooperation of Central American countries, targeting asylum seekers well before they reach the southern border, and achieving the same effect.
â€œMexico together with other Central American countries have built a wall for the president,â€ Chishti said. â€œItâ€™s just not on the border.â€
Here are seven ways the Trump administration has made it all but impossible to seek asylum in the US.
1) The Trump administration wants to send migrants back to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador
Over 978,000 migrants have arrived at the southern border over the past year. They are mostly coming from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, where rampant crime, violence, and corruption is driving hundreds of thousands to flee. In those countries, migrants are commonly robbed, kidnapped for ransom, raped, tortured, and killed.
El Salvador has the highest homicide rate in the world. Honduras is fifth, Guatemala is 16th, and Mexico is 19th, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Each country has rampant government corruption and high rates of violence against women and LGBTQ individuals, and remain hotspots for international criminal gang activity. The US State Department has issued travel warnings for US citizens in all four countries.
The administration has nevertheless sought to send migrants back to those countries.
It issued a sweeping rule in July that prevents migrants from being granted asylum if they passed through any country other than their own before arriving in the US â€” meaning asylum seekers showing up at the southern border who are from any country but Mexico are effectively ineligible for asylum (although some migrants would still be eligible for other protections that would allow them to stay in the US).
The Supreme Court allowed that rule to temporarily go into effect across the border in September while a lawsuit over the rule makes its way through the courts.

There are limited exceptions to the rule: Those who apply for asylum in another country but are rejected may bring their claims in the US. Victims of human trafficking and migrants who traveled through countries that are not parties to certain international human rights agreements are also exempt. But it effectively shuts out most asylum seekers and, on its own, represents the â€œmost significant change in the modern asylum system since 1980,â€ Chishti said.
The Trump administration has also brokered agreements with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador that could allow the US to return asylum seekers to those countries.
Outgoing Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan â€” who was a vocal supporter of increasing aid to Central America before he became acting secretary â€” has framed these agreements as a way to help the countries develop their asylum systems, including a pledge of $47 million to Guatemala for that purpose and a â€œcommitmentâ€ to help build capacity in El Salvador.
But they also include provisions that could be used to require migrants on their way to the US to seek asylum and other protections in those countries first.
Itâ€™s not clear at this point whether these agreements would actually be used to deport large numbers of asylum seekers showing up at the US border.
Taken together, the Trump administrationâ€™s rule and its agreements with Central American countries can be used to block the overwhelming majority of asylum claims from migrants showing up at the border. The administration has not had to rely on those policies to deport asylum seekers just yet; Trump has made asylum inaccessible for most recent arrivals by other means. But if courts strike those efforts down, the administration may revert to using these policies as another buffer against asylum seekers.
2) Mexico has become the choke point
The journey through Mexico alone is dangerous. As many as half a million migrants annually hitch a ride through the country atop a network of freight trains, known as â€œLa Bestiaâ€ or â€œThe Beast,â€ for days or weeks.
Along the way, they are targeted by criminal gangs and frequently kidnapped. And under Trump, migrants have also had to contend with Mexican authorities.
Mexico has refused to sign a â€œsafe third countryâ€ agreement, which would allow the US to turn away migrants who did not first seek asylum in Mexico. But it has started to cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement, stopping migrants in their tracks before they reach the US border.

Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador promised upon assuming office in December 2018 not to do the USâ€™s â€œdirty workâ€ in solving the Central American migration crisis. He distanced himself from the harsh immigration enforcement policies of his predecessor Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, who initiated an enforcement program in 2014 on Mexicoâ€™s southern border with Guatemala under which some 700,000 migrants were deported; instead, it sought to provide temporary humanitarian visas and work permits to migrants passing through Mexico.
But in June, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods unless LÃ³pez Obrador agreed to drive down the number of migrants arriving at the US southern border. LÃ³pez Obrador did an about-face: He deployed a record 15,000 troops to detain over 31,000 migrants that month and almost 19,000 in July.
Mark Morgan, the acting CBP commissioner, has praised Mexicoâ€™s enforcement efforts, attributing the recent drop in border apprehensions at the US southern border to LÃ³pez Obradorâ€™s administration.
â€œThe partnership between Mexico and the United States concerning this regional crisis is having a dramatic impact,â€ he told reporters on October 8. â€œ[T]he cooperation and partnership we have with Mexico right now really is one for the history books.â€
Mexico has consequently created a bottleneck for asylum seekers. If detained and deported by Mexican authorities, they may never even be able to reach the US border in order to claim asylum.
3) Getting in line at the US-Mexico border doesnâ€™t work anymore
If asylum seekers reach the southern border, they face a choice: either line up at a port of entry and wait to be processed by CBP officers, or try to cross the border without authorization. But the Trump administration has made waiting untenable.
Starting in mid-2018, CBP officials started limiting the number of asylum seekers they processed at ports of entry each day, forcing the others to wait in Mexico, where migrant shelters are at capacity and many have been forced to sleep on the streets.
Mexican immigration authorities keep lists of those who are waiting. The number of names on those lists exceeded 26,000 in August and thereâ€™s no telling how long much longer they will have to remain there before they are processed at the port.

An ongoing lawsuit brought by Al Otro Lado, one of the few legal aid organizations serving migrants in Mexico, argues that the metering policy deprives migrants of access to the US asylum system and is in violation of federal immigration law and their constitutional due process rights. Al Otro Lado has asked a federal court in California to block the policy, but in the meantime, it remains in effect.
There have also been numerous cases of families who were separated after finally being processed at ports of entry, even after a federal court prohibited the practice and despite DHSâ€™s claims to the contrary.
That might make the prospect of crossing the border without authorization a more attractive option. Democratic presidential candidate JuliÃ¡n Castro has argued that it is what caused 25-year-old Oscar Alberto MartÃ­nez RamÃ­rez to attempt to cross the Rio Grande with his 23-month-old daughter Valeria. They drowned; their bodies were discovered on June 24.
â€œThis metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river,â€ Castro said during the first Democratic primary debate in June. â€œOscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim, so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river, and they died because of that.â€
4) There is no guarantee of entry to the US
Even if asylum seekers finally get in front of an immigration agent, they wonâ€™t necessarily be allowed to enter the US.
Previously, both those who waited in line at the border and those who were apprehended between ports of entry would have been held at a CBP processing facility until a border agent determined whether they should be released, transferred to ICE detention, or deported. But now, most are quickly sent back to Mexico under the Trump administrationâ€™s â€œRemain in Mexicoâ€ policy, officially known as the â€œMigrant Protection Protocolsâ€ (MPP).

The policy, which was unveiled in January, applies to both those processed at ports of entry and those apprehended while trying to cross the border without authorization. It allows the government to send migrants with credible asylum claims back to Mexico while they await a final decision on their applications. About 55,000 migrants have been subject to the policy as of October, a CBP spokesperson told Vox. They have been allowed to enter the US only to attend their immigration court hearings, and largely unable to access legal counsel.
McAleenan announced in September that the policy now covers most families arriving at the southern border.
Under its own guidance, DHS is supposed to exempt â€œvulnerable populationsâ€ from the Remain in Mexico policy and allow them to stay in the US, but anecdotally, few migrants have been able to obtain such exemptions. A CBP spokesperson told Vox that the agency does not track the number of exemptions granted.
The advocacy group Human Rights First issued a report earlier this month documenting dozens of cases in which inherently vulnerable immigrants â€” including those with serious health issues and pregnant women â€” and immigrants who were already victims of kidnapping, rape, and assault in Mexico were sent back under MPP.
The Ninth Circuit, however, is considering a case challenging the policy and could block it any day now.
5) Trump has massively expanded the detention of asylum seekers
Immigration agents who process asylum seekers at the border â€” either after they stood in line at a port of entry or after they were caught trying to cross without authorization â€” will usually send them back to Mexico under the Remain in Mexico policy. But as an alternative, authorities can instead choose to detain them at facilities inside the US.
The Trump administration has done so systematically, setting out to indiscriminately prosecute and detain anyone who tries to cross the border without authorization, even if they ask for asylum, under its â€œzero toleranceâ€ policy.
Announced in April 2018, the zero tolerance policy coincided with a shift in the demographics of migrants showing up at the border: Families now make up the majority of those apprehended, rather than single adult males.
As a result, the Trump administration has sent record numbers of asylum-seeking families to immigration detention who typically would have been released under previous administrations. The governmentâ€™s rationale was that the practice of releasing families â€” what Trump has called â€œcatch and releaseâ€ â€” was encouraging migrants to come to the US and that keeping them in detention while their immigration cases were underway would deter further migration.
Itâ€™s not clear whether itâ€™s been an effective deterrent. Even as the administration was filling detention centers to their capacity and obtaining additional funding for more beds in immigration detention, the number of migrants showing up at the border kept rising through April of this year. The overall numbers have since fallen, but for migrants who face genuine danger in their home countries, the change in detention policy isnâ€™t likely to stop them from seeking refuge in the US.
The US does not have enough facilities licensed to detain families on the scale Trump has sought, which in part led his administration to separate over 4,000 immigrant families before a court ordered it to end the practice in July 2018. But the administration is still pursuing a rule that would allow it to put more families in detention and hold them indefinitely, eliminating certain restrictions on the detention of children. A federal court, however, has also blocked that effort for now.
Though the family separations crisis is mostly over, the conditions in detention centers remain substandard and dangerous. Since Trump took office, 12 immigrants have died in CBP custody and another 27 have died in ICE custody, including a 2-year-old suffering from pneumonia and a 7-year-old who went into cardiac arrest from severe dehydration.
Migrants arenâ€™t supposed to be held in CBP facilities for more than 72 hours under the agencyâ€™s own guidelines. But CBP hasnâ€™t complied with those guidelines following the implementation of the zero tolerance policy.
So migrants remain in dangerously overcrowded facilities that were never designed to hold them for days and weeks at a time, sleeping on concrete floors with nothing but mylar blankets. A federal appeals court ruled in August that CBP was obligated to provide basic hygiene items including toothbrushes and soap to children in its custody after a government attorney suggested that those items were nonessential. The conditions in many ICE detention facilities have been found to be similarly inhumane.
6) Asylum seekers arenâ€™t getting a fair day in court
Usually while still detained, most migrants seeking asylum will have to make their case before an immigration judge in what is usually a lengthy process: As of June, migrants with active immigration cases have been waiting an average of almost two years for a decision.
Immigrants typically have a short initial hearing before a judge and a government attorney to learn about their rights and how their case will proceed. They are usually given time to retain a lawyer and prepare their case, which includes gathering documents attesting to experiences that might make them eligible for relief from deportation or protections under the asylum system or international torture agreements.

They then have to wait for another hearing in which they actually argue why they should be permitted to remain in the US before an immigration judge makes a decision on their case.
Immigration judges donâ€™t operate in the federal court system â€” theyâ€™re overseen by the Department of Justice, the same agency that is currently trying to prosecute immigrants for crossing the border without authorization. While the DOJ has traditionally left the immigration courts to operate independently, Trumpâ€™s attorney generals have increasingly intervened, raising concerns that immigrants are being deprived of a fair day in court.
US Attorney General William Barr and his predecessor Jeff Sessions have tried to make it more difficult for victims of gang violence and domestic abuse, LGBTQ individuals, and those whose family members have been persecuted to obtain asylum.
Theyâ€™ve also introduced policy changes that they claimed were designed to whittle down the backlog of cases in the immigration courts, which surpassed 1 million in August, but that have put migrantsâ€™ due process rights at risk.
Most significantly, Sessions established case completion quotas for immigration judges, encouraging them to quickly order immigrants deported and deny their asylum claims. Both Sessions and Barr have also taken away a number of tools that immigration judges have traditionally used to give asylum seekers more time to obtain attorneys or to close deportation cases that werenâ€™t high priority.
All of these changes have sparked renewed support in the advocacy community to make the immigration court system independent of the DOJ.
DHS has also constructed temporary courts â€” which opened last month in tent complexes near CBP ports in Laredo and Brownsville, Texas, â€” to hear cases from migrants affected by Remain in Mexico. Immigrants and their attorneys video conference with judges and DHS attorneys appearing virtually, streamed from brick-and-mortar immigration courts hundreds of miles away.
House Democrats have called for investigations of the temporary courts, raising concerns that they violate migrantsâ€™ due process rights by restricting their access to attorneys and relying on teleconferencing. They also expressed alarm that the public has largely been barred from entering the tent facilities, shrouding their operations in secrecy.
7) Some migrants never set foot in a courtroom at all
The government has the power to put some migrants in whatâ€™s called â€œexpedited removal proceedings,â€ under which they can be deported in a matter of days without seeing a judge or an attorney. It currently applies to individuals who are arrested within 100 miles of a land border within two weeks of their arrival.
But in July, Trump tried to expand who can be subjected to expedited removal, issuing a rule that would have also included immigrants found anywhere in the US if they arrived within the last two years â€” an estimated 20,000 people annually. That rule has been blocked temporarily as part of an ongoing legal challenge, but it could still be revived.
The administration also wants to make it much more difficult for asylum seekers to get work permits during the months or years it takes for their claims to make their way through court. For non-detained asylum seekers who cannot afford to be unemployed and are not eligible for most public benefits, that means they would need to either give up their asylum claims in the US altogether or find under-the-table jobs in the shadow economy.
These incremental, technical changes in the immigration court system collectively have put asylum seekersâ€™ access to justice at risk. But now that most asylum seekers are being pushed back to Mexico and having their hearings at the secretive tent facilities on the border, the problem is nowhere near as visible to the public.
â€œI donâ€™t think the public knows that the modern asylum system has been eroded because this has happened one thing at a time,â€ Chishti said. â€œThere is a certain amount of fatigue in opposition to Trump. Itâ€™s very difficult to maintain the intensity.â€"
"While Donald Trump is attempting to avoid Richard Nixonâ€™s presidential fate, the Trump adviser with Nixonâ€™s face tattooed on his back is going on trial.
The trial of Roger Stone â€” the longtime GOP operative and dirty trickster who was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller â€” will finally kick off in Washington, DC, Tuesday. Day one will be devoted to jury selection, and opening arguments will begin once that wraps up â€” Wednesday at the earliest.
The proceedings will feature ample discussion of Donald Trump and advisers such as Paul Manafort and Steve Bannon, with a focus on just what, exactly, Stone was telling them about those hacked Democratic emails back in 2016.
The charges against Stone allege that he tried to obstruct the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election by lying to the committee about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks and by encouraging another witness to lie for him as well.
Russian intelligence officersâ€™ hacking of leading Democratsâ€™ emails was one of the key planks of the Kremlinâ€™s effort to interfere with the 2016 campaign. Those emails, from the DNC and Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign chair, were eventually posted publicly by WikiLeaks. But one big question Mueller explored was whether any Trump associates were involved in the dissemination of those hacked emails.
That investigation eventually focused on Stone, who had both publicly and privately claimed some advance knowledge about what WikiLeaks was planning. Prosecutors claim senior Trump campaign officials â€œdirectedâ€ Stone â€œto inquireâ€ about future WikiLeaks releases, and have revealed emails showing that Stone indeed tried to get in touch with the groups.
But what, exactly, prosecutors believe truly happened between Stone and WikiLeaks isnâ€™t clear. They didnâ€™t end up charging Stone about anything he actually did in 2016, but rather his alleged attempts to lie about and cover up what happened afterward. And the Mueller reportâ€™s final word on what, if anything, Trumpâ€™s advisers knew about WikiLeaksâ€™s plans was redacted â€” to avoid prejudicing this very trial.
The proceeding is certain to be a sensation. Steve Bannon, the former top White House adviser, is reportedly likely to testify â€” against Stone. Prosecutors have signaled they will discuss several phone numbers for Trump himself, apparently to allege Stone spoke with the president about Wikileaks. Stone, a colorful character, may take the stand in his own defense. And all of this will unfold at a perilous moment for Trump, with unpredictable effects on the Houseâ€™s impeachment inquiry.
Who is Roger Stone?

Stone has had a reputation for political shenanigans since he was a 19-year-old volunteer carrying out dirty tricks to embarrass Richard Nixonâ€™s 1972 Republican primary opponent â€” something that earned Stone a minor role in the Watergate hearings.
As a Republican campaign operative, he worked for Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bob Dole; as a highly paid lobbyist, he worked alongside his friend Paul Manafort for a host of seedy clients. And heâ€™s long been known as a colorful character who rejoices in the dark side of politics: scandals, smears, division, and negativity. Journalists have called him â€œthe state of the art Washington sleazeballâ€ and the â€œboastful black prince of Republican sleaze.â€
Stone also, incredibly enough, spent nearly three decades trying to get Donald Trump for president before Trump actually went through with it. The two met in the mid-1980s, as Trump hired Stone and Manafortâ€™s firm to do lobbying and PR for him. After Trump released his book The Art of the Deal in 1987, Stone urged him to consider running for president the following year, but Trump demurred. In 1999, Stone ran a presidential exploratory committee for Trump â€” but Trump again ended up not officially running.

The two had their ups and downs over the years (â€œRoger is a stone-cold loser,â€ Trump told the New Yorker in 2008, arguing he â€œalways tries taking credit for things he never didâ€). But by 2011, as Trump mused about challenging President Barack Obama, Stone was egging him on again, urging him to spread conspiracy theories about Obamaâ€™s birthplace.
So when Trump finally did launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, Stone was on board as an official campaign adviser. But he didnâ€™t last long. After clashing with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, he left his official role in August 2015.
Yet Stone remained in contact with Trump himself to some extent and continued to try to support Trumpâ€™s candidacy from the outside. And some of those outside efforts landed him at the center of the Mueller investigation, leading to his arrest and indictment this January.
Why was Roger Stone indicted?
The charges allege that Stone attempted to obstruct the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in 2017 because he wanted to hide the truth about what happened between him and WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.
WikiLeaks infamously posted thousands of emails that Russian intelligence officers had hacked from the DNC (in July 2016) and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta (in October 2016), rocking the presidential campaign.
In the midst of all this, Stone was telling top Trump officials that he had some inside knowledge about what WikiLeaks and the groupâ€™s founder Julian Assange were planning next, prosecutors allege. And he was telling one of his associates â€” conservative author Jerome Corsi â€” to try and find out more about what Assange had.
â€œGet to Assangeâ€ at the â€œEcuadorian Embassy in London and get the pending WL emails,â€ Stone emailed Corsi on July 25, 2016. Corsiâ€™s response to Stone, sent about a week later, contains a curious reference to â€œPodestaâ€ â€” even though it was not yet publicly known that Podestaâ€™s emails had been hacked.
Stone then began publicly making ominous predictions about what WikiLeaks was planning. He claimed heâ€™d had â€œsome back-channel communicationâ€ with WikiLeaks and Assange. He tweeted in August that it will soon be â€œPodestaâ€™s time in the barrel.â€ And in the days before the Podesta emails were actually posted by WikiLeaks, Stone exchanged emails and messages with Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon and Bannonâ€™s associates about WikiLeaksâ€™s plans.
Enough of this occurred in public that Stone earned a good deal of scrutiny. Congressional investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 campaign wanted to know if Stone did in fact have inside information about the stolen emails, who he might have gotten that information from, and whether he told anyone in the official Trump campaign.
So prosecutors allege that, when the House Intelligence Committee started asking questions in 2017, Stone lied. Specifically, Stone falsely claimed all of his information about WikiLeaksâ€™s plans came from a single â€œintermediaryâ€: radio host Randy Credico. He also claimed he never asked his intermediary to communicate anything to Assange, said he had no relevant documents to hand over to the committee, and pressured Credico into backing up his false cover story.
For all that, Muellerâ€™s team charged Stone with one count of obstructing an official proceeding, five counts of making false statements, and one count of witness tampering.
What actually happened here?
What did Stone actually know about WikiLeaks? Who did he learn it from? And did he share inside information about this with the Trump campaign?
Those questions have never fully been answered by the government. Muellerâ€™s prosecutors had enough information to feel comfortable charging Stone for lying, but they havenâ€™t publicly laid out any larger explanation about what they feel the truth was.
Such an explanation, however, may be sitting in the Mueller report, covered by black bars.
Recall that Mueller did not end up filing any criminal charges against Trump associates related to the hacking and leaking of emails. The investigation, he said, did not â€œestablishâ€ such a criminal conspiracy.
That is different from claiming Trump associates had no involvement in the email leaks. In fact, there is a section of the report titled â€œTrump Campaign and the Dissemination of Hacked Materials.â€ Itâ€™s 10 pages long, and the only public version of it is heavily redacted. Here are a few tastes.
Most of the redactions in this section were made under the justification that theyâ€™d cause â€œHarmâ€ to an â€œOngoing Matterâ€ â€” and, from context, itâ€™s clear that that ongoing matter is Roger Stoneâ€™s prosecution. (Court rules require that the government not release derogatory information about a defendant before the trial.)
You can see above that the redacted material in this section involves Trump personally. â€œShortly after the call candidate Trump told [deputy campaign manager Rick] Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming,â€ one unredacted bit reads. Itâ€™s likely that Roger Stone was at the other end of that call, but those frustrating redactions prevent us from seeing the full story.
Much of this section discusses Corsi, who Stone had told to â€œget to Assange.â€ But again, itâ€™s mostly redacted.
It is likely that prosecutors trying to make their case at Stoneâ€™s trial will reveal at least some of what is under these redactions. If, for whatever reason they donâ€™t, this material could be released after Stoneâ€™s trial ends. So we do seem to be getting close to learning more about one of the Mueller reportâ€™s biggest missing pieces.

What else should we expect to see at Roger Stoneâ€™s trial?
For one, expect there to be some interesting witnesses. One will likely be Rick Gates, the deputy Trump campaign chair who flipped on his longtime boss Paul Manafort last year, testifying against him at his own trial.
Steve Bannon, the former Trump campaign CEO and White House chief strategist, is also reportedly likely to appear as a government witness against Stone. Bannon seems to have told the government about discussions he and Stone had about WikiLeaks. Because of that, Stone has publicly attacked Bannon, calling him a â€œ#muellerinformantâ€.
Trump himself will also be the subject of ample discussion. One of the false statements charges against Stone focuses on his claim that he never discussed his WikiLeaks intermediary with anyone involved in the Trump campaign. To prove Stone was lying here, prosecutors have signaled they intend to bring up various phone numbers â€” for Trump, Bannon, Gates, Manafort, and others â€” that will make clear Stone was in contact with them at key moments.
And then thereâ€™s the question of whether Stone will testify in his own defense (something Manafort did not do). Earlier this year, Stoneâ€™s attorney Bruce Rogow asserted to the New Yorker that â€œRoger will definitely take the stand in his own defenseâ€ and that â€œit will be key to the case.â€ Such a move is often not advisable for a defendant, but Stone has a good deal of confidence in his talents at obfuscation. The trickster may have one more trick to play â€” though the audience, a Washington, DC, jury, may be a skeptical one."
"Debates about policy often disguise debates about politics. Such is the case with the health care fight raging across the Democratic primary.
Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren revealed her plan to finance Medicare-for-all without raising taxes on the middle class. This kicked off a series of arguments about whether her cost assumptions are realistic and whether her financing decisions are ideal. Sen. Bernie Sanders said one of his proposed approaches is â€œmore progressive.â€ Joe Bidenâ€™s campaign called it â€œa new tax on employers of almost $9 trillion.â€ Pete Buttigieg called her math â€œcontroversial.â€
These are worthwhile arguments, but theyâ€™re downstream from the true disagreement, the one that is shaping all these plans. The fundamental question dividing Warren and Bernie Sanders from the rest of the field, and even from each other, isnâ€™t how you pay for health care reform, itâ€™s how you pass it.
Are you likelier to pass some kind of health reform by arguing for the biggest, boldest, least-compromised plan imaginable? Or does starting that way guarantee total failure and possibly grease Donald Trumpâ€™s path to reelection in 2020?
This, more than anything, is what the Democrats are actually arguing about. Every single Democratic candidate wants to cover every single American with high-quality health insurance. Every one of them believes America would be better off if we had a national health care system along the lines of what we see in Canada and Germany and the Netherlands and Japan. But many of them believe proposing a total overhaul of the entire American health care system makes it likelier that Democrats end up with nothing. The only health care bill that will make anyoneâ€™s life better is the one that actually passes.
What Sanders and Warren have done, skillfully, is to frame this as a difference in ideal policies. They want to cover every single American. The other Democrats donâ€™t. The Biden/Buttigieg/Klobuchar/Bennet/Delaney/Bullock/etc. axis basically regard that as slander. They think their plans will cover more people than Sanders/Warren because their plans can pass, while Sanders/Warren will end up covering nobody because their plans will be ripped apart. Itâ€™s an argument that matters for far more than just health care.
â€œWe canâ€™t create real change for people if we canâ€™t win elections,â€ Biden says.
The case for caution
Hereâ€™s the argument: The American public wants better health care but history has shown, over and over again, that they fear radical change. If you begin with a plan that triggers that fear rather than quelling it and that unifies the entire medical industry and most of corporate America against you, youâ€™ll end in total defeat â€” as happened when Vermont tried to move to single payer in 2014 and when Colorado tried in 2016 and when Bill Clinton proposed a far-reaching overhaul of the health system in 1994.
The American political system is built to make radical change nearly impossible and the history of health reform reflects that truth: grand ambitions get dashed, piecemeal reforms occasionally succeed. ClintonCare failed, but Obamacare, which was far less ambitious, passed. Single-payer has repeatedly failed, but Medicare and Medicaid passed â€” and even they began as more compromised programs than people remember (Medicare, for instance, didnâ€™t cover prescription drugs, while Medicaid covered only a small fraction of those who are eligible today).
The moderates note that every Democrat running for president who represents a purple or red state supports a more incrementalist approach. It seems likely they know something about their own voters. And itâ€™s not just the ones running for president: House Democrats who represent swing districts tend to be cool toward Medicare-for-all, and because of that, Speaker Nancy Pelosi says Medicare-for-all is a nonstarter. Similarly, the key Senate Democrats have made clear what they think can pass, and it stops far short of single payer. Sandersâ€™s Medicare for All bill has 14 co-sponsors, but whatâ€™s become clear throughout the primary is that many of those co-sponsors â€” like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris â€” donâ€™t actually support it as currently written.
So, ask the moderates, what on earth is the point of running for president on an easy-to-demagogue government takeover of American health care that doesnâ€™t even have support among congressional Democrats?
The case for total overhaul
The Sanders/Warren/single-payer supporter rebuttal is threefold. First, as Warren likes to say, â€œyou donâ€™t get what you donâ€™t fight for.â€ Thereâ€™s a long-standing view on the left that Democrats get less because they demand less, and that they end up with uninspiring policy because they spend so much time compromising with themselves. Then they wonder why their supporters donâ€™t show up in the next election.
Second, single-payer supporters believe the central obstacle to single-payer is that politicians and pundits paint it as radical and emphasize public opposition rather than focusing their fire and coverage on the inequities of the current system. In this telling, the opposition to radical reform reflects the rhetorical and political choices of leaders, not a fundamental truth of public opinion or American political institutions. If you can move â€œthe Overton window,â€ you can pass the policy.
Third, both Warren and Sanders believe, to different degrees, in a class mobilization theory of politics: You focus on policies that will inspire your supporters and make clear whoâ€™s side youâ€™re on in the class war. Yes, that has the effect of unifying industry against you, but thatâ€™s a feature, not a bug: Itâ€™s in making clear who your enemies are that you convince your supporters youâ€™re truly on their side.
Itâ€™s not about whether you compromise. Itâ€™s about whether you get to a compromise.
The rhetorical ambition of the Sanders/Warren camp can sometimes make it seem like they reject all compromise. But Warren and Sanders serve in the Senate. Theyâ€™ve watched legislation pass. They know you donâ€™t get everything you want. But they believe that if you start by asking for everything you want, you may end up with 70 percent, while if you start by asking for 70 percent of what you want, youâ€™re going to end up with 40 percent.
The moderates think this mechanical understanding of the cost of legislative compromise is a mistake. The key mistake, in their view, is that it assumes passage and ignores the chance of failure. But in Congress, the likeliest outcome is always failure.
If President Bernie Sanders sends House Democrats his single-payer proposal and what follows is months of Democratic infighting followed by that proposal dying as moderate members refuse to support it, the next step isnâ€™t a 70 percent compromise but the total collapse of the effort â€” the 1994 scenario, in other words. If you start with something that splits your own party and unifies the opposition, youâ€™ll lose before you ever get to the final bargaining rounds. Begin by demanding 100 percent, in other words, and youâ€™re likelier to end with zero percent.
So far, Iâ€™ve grouped Sanders and Warren together, but these questions even split them. Warren, in particular, has designed her financing plan around accepting the idea that anything that can be called a middle-class hike is politically lethal and that Medicare-for-all needs to be financed purely by new taxes on the rich and corporations, even if that means leaving in place a costly and inefficient system of employer-based financing.
Sanders, by contrast, has long believed that Americans will support European-style taxes in return for a European-style social welfare state, and thatâ€™s an argument that Democrats can win if only they make it. As my colleague Matthew Yglesias writes, these differing beliefs have led them to embrace policies that invert their reputations: â€œIn this case, Sanders is the one putting more emphasis on technocratic soundness, while Warren seems more attuned to populist politics.â€
The plans the candidates are proposing reflect their ideas about how politics works, not just what the ideal policy would be. Health care has become the defining fight in the Democratic primary, but the approaches the candidates have taken to the issue speak to their broader ideas about how to campaign and govern."
"â€œYouâ€™re going to think that Iâ€™m incredibly naive,â€ former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators last month. â€œBut I couldnâ€™t imagine all the things that have happened over the last 6 or 7 months. I just couldnâ€™t imagine it.â€
That quote comes from the transcript of Yovanovitchâ€™s closed-door testimony, released on Monday. In it, the former ambassador describes the stunning sequence of events that led to her sudden ouster from her post in April â€” a sequence that started with a smear campaign against her from Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trumpâ€™s personal attorney.
By the end of it, she says, she was told to leave Ukraine on the next plane out for her own â€œsecurity.â€ Officials later clarified to her this wasnâ€™t due to a physical threat but rather because the State Department feared Trump would attack her by tweet unless she was removed immediately.
House Democrats released the transcript Monday, beginning the impeachment inquiryâ€™s transition into a more public-facing phase. They intend to release more transcripts of depositions of other witnesses this week.
Because Yovanovitch was ousted back in April, she canâ€™t shed much light on the key allegations against Trump: that he pressured Ukraineâ€™s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Joe Biden and his son in exchange for a White House meeting and withheld US military aid. All that unfolded after she left Kyiv.
But she did give her side of the story about how things ended up there â€” explaining how US foreign policy seemed to be hijacked by political plots. She explained that at one point she was advised that if she wanted to keep her job, she should tweet that she supports Trump. And she confirmed that an ominous comment about her by Trump â€” â€œsheâ€™s going to go through some thingsâ€ â€” made her feel threatened.
Rumors of a plot
Yovanovitch testified that she first learned that Giuliani had an interest in Ukraine toward the end of last year â€” in November or December. And what she heard was alarming.
â€œBasically, it was people in the Ukrainian Government who said that Mr. Lutsenko, the former prosecutor general, was in communication with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had plans,â€ Yovanovitch said. â€œThey were going to, you know, do things, including to me.â€
At the time, Lutsenko was the prosecutor general â€” the top law enforcement official â€” for the previous Ukrainian presidential administration.
As an apparent effort to win President Trumpâ€™s favor, Lutsenko and Giuliani began discussing the possibility that the Ukrainian prosecutor general could launch investigations into Trumpâ€™s enemies. Heâ€™d investigate Burisma (the Ukrainian natural gas company Hunter Biden sat on the board of) as well as purported Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Per Yovanovitch, Lutsenko asked the US embassy to set up meetings with top US law enforcement officials from the FBI or Justice Department. But Yovanovitch says she objected to that because thatâ€™s not the typical way these things are handled. Instead, she encouraged him to meet with the FBIâ€™s legal attachÃ© in Kyiv. â€œI donâ€™t think he really appreciated it,â€ she told investigators.
In connection with this effort, Lutsenko also began spreading what Yovanovitch says was a completely fabricated story about her â€” that she gave him a list of people she didnâ€™t want him to prosecute. (Lutsenko has since recanted that story.) Rumors also spread that she was a Trump critic. The goal of these rumors seems to have been to push her out of the ambassadorship.
Only gradually, though, did Yovanovitch realize the extent of the smear campaign against her. In February 2019, she said, a senior Ukrainian official â€œtold me I really needed to watch my back.â€
Yovanovitch says that this official, a cabinet minister, explained â€œthat there were two individuals from Floridaâ€ â€” Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman â€” â€œwho were working with Mayor Giuliani, and that they had set up the meetings for Mr. Giuliani with Mr. Lutsenko.â€ Parnas and Fruman â€œwere interested in having a different ambassadorâ€ because â€œthey wanted to have business dealings in Ukraine,â€ she says she was told. (Parnas and Fruman were indicted in the US for campaign finance violations last month.)
The presidentâ€™s allies begin attacking Yovanovitch publicly and the State Department refuses to push back
In March of this year, the campaign against Yovanovitch exploded into public view due to an interview Lutsenko gave to John Solomon of The Hill repeating the unsubstantiated allegation that Yovanovitch had given him a â€œdo not prosecuteâ€ list.
Soon, top Trump allies like Giuliani and Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity were openly attacking Yovanovitch. The presidentâ€™s son Don Jr. also tweeted an article about calls to remove her, writing that the US needs â€œless of these jokers as ambassadors.â€
â€œIf you have the Presidentâ€™s son sayingâ€ that, Yovanovitch testified, â€œit makes it hard to be a credible ambassador.â€ So she asked the State Department whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo could issue a statement defending her.
But Pompeo never did so. Yovanovitch was told this was in part due to fear that any such statement could quickly be â€œunderminedâ€â€” by the president, with â€œa tweet or something.â€
Yovanovitch says she asked US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland for advice on how to handle the situation, and his advice was that she should publicly proclaim her loyalty to President Trump.
Asked again about Sondlandâ€™s advice, Yovanovitch said, â€œHe may not have used the words â€˜support President Trump.â€™â€ But he said, â€œYou know the sorts of things he likes,â€ and recommended she â€œgo out there battling aggressivelyâ€ and â€œpraise him or support him.â€
In another curious move, the State Department seems to have engaged in some diplomacy with Hannity, the Fox News host. Yovanovitch was told that Pompeo or one of his aides â€œwas going to place a call to Mr. Hannity on Fox News to say, you know, what is going on?â€ She said the call was made, and for a time â€œthings kind of simmered down.â€ But not for long.
Yovanovitch was ousted quite suddenly in April
On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidency in a landslide. And just three days after that, Yovanovitch said, she was told she would be removed from her post.
Around 10 pm Kyiv time, Yovanovitch says, she got a call from the State Departmentâ€™s director general, Carol Perez. â€œShe said that she was giving me a heads-up, that things were going wrong, kind of off the track,â€ Yovanovitch said. Perez told her that there was â€œnervousnessâ€ among State Department leadership and in the White House but did not explain further.
About three hours later â€” around 1 am in Kyiv â€” Perez called Yovanovitch back and said she had to leave Ukraine immediately.
Yovanovitch asked if there was concern for her physical security and Perez said that wasnâ€™t the impression she got, but that she should come back to the US immediately.
She did so, and once back in Washington, she asked what had happened. And, she says, State Department official Phil Reeker told her that, essentially, it was Trumpâ€™s decision â€” that Trump had wanted her out for nearly a year, that Pompeo had tried â€œto protectâ€ her but that he â€œwas no longer able to do that.â€
Soon, she spoke to the Deputy Secretary of State, John Sullivan. â€œHe repeated what Phil had already told me, which is that this was coming from President Trumpâ€ and that it was â€œfinal.â€
Yovanovitch added that Sullivan elaborated more on the need for urgency in her departure â€” explaining that the real fear was over â€œsome sort of either public tweet or something else from the White Houseâ€ attacking Yovanovitch. The cryptic demand for her return, he said, was to make sure sheâ€™d be treated with â€œas much respect as possible.â€
Yovanovitch felt threatened by Trump
In September, the White House released the document summarizing Trumpâ€™s July 25 phone call with President Zelensky and Yovanovitch says she was â€œshockedâ€ to learn she was a subject of discussion.
â€œThe former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news, and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just want to let you know that,â€ Trump said. He later added, about Yovanovitch: â€œWell, sheâ€™s going to go through some things.â€
Asked what she interpreted Trumpâ€™s line saying sheâ€™d â€œgo through some thingsâ€ to mean, Yovanovitch said she didnâ€™t really know. But asked if she felt â€œthreatenedâ€ by Trump, she said yes. And she said she even wondered if Trump was hinting that the FBI had launched an investigation into her related to the bogus allegations Giuliani and Lutsenko had circulated.
â€œI just simply donâ€™t know what this could mean,â€ Yovanovitch added, â€œbut it does not leave me in a comfortable position.â€"
"An October 6 column from mild-mannered New York Times columnist David Leonhardt carried the striking headline â€œThe Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You.â€
And it was paired with an even more striking chart suggesting that the top 400 richest people in America pay a lower average tax rate than the middle class or the poor â€” and that this is a new phenomenon. The Times plotted a tax rate curve for every year from 1950 to 2018 (the interactive on their site lets you look through it year by year) and showed that while rates used to slope upward, theyâ€™re now largely flat until reaching the top 99.99 percent, after which they begin to plunge.
Data from UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.
The analysis is based on a new book by French-born UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, The Triumph of Injustice: How the Rich Dodge Taxes and How to Make Them Pay. They want to make the rich pay by levying a wealth tax on large fortunes, exactly the approach now advocated by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders; Saez and Zucman worked as outside advisers to Warren when she crafted her wealth tax proposal.
Leonhardt presented the chart as simply based on â€œnewly released dataâ€ from the book and dedicated the bulk of his column to addressing other issues posed by Saez and Zucmanâ€™s case for higher taxes on the rich. But the chart itself has touched off a weeks-long furor on economics Twitter plus an in-person debate including Saez, Zucman, and Larry Summers, a top economic adviser in both the Clinton and Obama administrations.
The duel over the chart is in part a technical battle, in part an ideological one, and in part a personality-focused clash about Warren. All the key participants in the fight are economists, and the battle is in part a fight about the economics profession and its role in the policymaking process â€” with traditionalists seeing Saez and Zucman as throwing professional good practice out to make a rhetorical point and Saez and Zucman seeing the profession as engaged in a process of mystification to serve the interests of the wealthy.
But beyond the specifics, the debate is also an object lesson in the annoying reality that the distinction between questions of facts and questions of values is not as clear in practice as one might like. Even a seemingly simple question like â€œhow much do different people pay in taxes?â€ doesnâ€™t have a clear-cut and unambiguous answer.
The mysteries of tax incidence
So how much do you pay in taxes?
This starts out looking like a simple question. You add up your income, then you add up how much tax you paid, and then you do a little division and you get a number. Thatâ€™s easy enough to do for federal income and payroll taxes. And, indeed, the Congressional Budget Office regularly computes these numbers and invariably finds that the rich pay a higher share of their income in taxes. But thatâ€™s not the whole story. For one thing, you need to factor in state and local taxes, which tend to hit the middle class harder than the rich.
More importantly, though, you have to determine who really pays specific taxes, what economists call â€œtax incidence.â€
Payroll taxes in the United States, for example, are levied half on employees and half on employers. A standard assumption in the economics literature is that even the taxes formally paid by employers in reality come out of workersâ€™ wages. Sales taxes raise a similar question: Are they paid by customers or by vendors? And there is considerable controversy over who really pays the corporate income tax: shareholders, workers, customers, etc. Estate taxes, similarly, are formally paid by the estates of dead people, but to get a comprehensive view of the tax code, you need to assign them to someone whoâ€™s alive.
Whatâ€™s more, for rich people there is some ambiguity as to how to think about income. For rhetorical purposes, at least, people sometimes talk about increases in share prices as if they are income â€” meaning Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos â€œmakesâ€ thousands of dollars per minute during times when the stock market is going up.
For tax purposes, however, these kinds of capital gains only count as income when stocks are actually sold and investment returns are realized.
Thatâ€™s why inequality charts that count capital gains as income, like this one from Saez, end up showing so much year-to-year instability in the earnings of the top one percent.
A further complicating factor are tax credits liked the Earned Income Tax Credit or the Child Tax Credit that are fully or partially refundable. The way a $100 tax credit works is that you calculate what you owe in income taxes and then subtract $100 from the figure â€” so the credit is a tax cut. But a refundable credit can reduce your tax liability to less than zero, in which case the IRS sends you a â€œrefundâ€ check.
This is a kludgy way to do policy, but Congress in its wisdom has chosen to use wholly or partially refundable credits as a means to help low-income families, and whether you count those refunds as â€œnegative taxesâ€ or government spending can change considerably how these charts look.
Last but by no means least, just as some taxes are levied on corporations, some income accrues to corporations and then just sits on their balance sheet as retained earnings. Itâ€™s normal to just ignore this, but for the sake of completeness, it would be better to consider it. Zucman and Saez do consider it and, in fact, make a whole series of contestable choices about these questions driven in part by an urge to completely account for all income in the economy.
A complete view of national income
Gross domestic product â€” the total of all the value of goods and services produced in a country, or the total value of all income earned in that country â€” is a critical economic statistic. So critical, in fact, that itâ€™s conventional to say â€œthe economyâ€ grew 3 percent when we mean GDP grew 3 percent.
One project that Saez, Zucman, and Thomas Piketty have been involved with is an effort to develop distributive national accounts that would let us know whose income grew 3 percent when overall national income grew by 3 percent.
To make that comprehensive income accounting work, you need to attribute the retained corporate earnings to someone â€” so they add it to the incomes of the (mostly wealthy) people who own the corporations. You also need to make various choices about taxes. They follow the official GDP figures in construing refundable tax credits as government spending â€” equivalent to Medicare mailing a reimbursement to a doctor, Social Security sending a check to a retiree â€” rather than negative taxes. They say that employer-side payroll taxes are paid by workers, that retail sales taxes are paid by consumers, and in that paper they say that corporate income taxes are paid by owners of capital (except for housing).
These are all plausible ways of looking at the situation, but they all make important differences, and making different assumptions changes things. Saez and Zucman made one critical change in their model of how corporate taxes work between the publication of their national accounts paper with Piketty and the release of their book.
The headline fact rests on a bunch of assumptions
Treatment of the corporate income tax is particularly important for this exercise because Congress enacted a big corporate tax cut in 2017.
Prior to that, the Saez/Zucman data shows the top 400 taxpayers paying a lower overall tax rate than the top 0.01 percent or the top 0.1 percent, but a similar rate to the rest of the top 20 percent of the income distribution and a clearly higher rate than the bottom 80 percent.
And this is important because, as first noted by libertarian economic historian Phil Magness, changing how corporate income taxes are handled makes a big difference in terms of assessing what rate the richest Americans are paying in taxes.
The solid orange line represents the tax rates estimated by Saez, Zucman, and Pikettyâ€™s scholarly article, using the assumption that the burden of the corporate income tax is spread across all non-housing capital (including small businesses and such), whereas the dotted line shows the Saez/Zucman bookâ€™s estimates based on the idea that corporate taxes are all paid by corporate shareholders.
Since ownership of corporations is very highly concentrated among the richest people, if you consider a corporate tax rate cut to be a pure tax cut for owners of tax-paying corporations, then you will get the conclusion that the Trump tax cut was an incredible windfall for the top 400 taxpayers.
On the right, itâ€™s popular to argue the exact opposite of this: that the economic burden of the corporate income tax falls largely on workers and that Trumpâ€™s tax changes are a boon to wage growth. There are well-qualified people with a whole range of views about this, though as Saez and Zucman argue in their book, it does seem telling that rich people tend to lobby loudly for corporate income tax cuts and labor unions do not (if corporate tax cuts really do help workers, unions should be the biggest champions for corporate tax cuts).
In any case, the shocking new fact presented in Leonhardtâ€™s column â€” that the very richest people pay a lower tax rate than the middle class â€” is not just a result of policy changes but a result of changes in how Saez and Zucman think we should understand the corporate income tax, changes from their own work just a year prior.
Beyond those modeling issues, the income estimate for the top 400 taxpayers is not a direct measurement; the tax data necessary to estimate their income after Trumpâ€™s tax cuts is not yet available from the IRS. Instead, Saez and Zucman write in a technical appendix that it â€œis based on triangulating publicly available sources and it could be refined in future workâ€ and they offer various hopes that more precise estimation will be possible in the future.
To pile together several controversial assumptions, pair them with an uncertain estimate relating to the wealthiest people, compile that into a striking new fact that becomes the centerpiece of a media rollout aimed simultaneously at promoting a popular book and intervening in a presidential primary campaign â€” all this rubs academic instincts the wrong way and helps explain a fair amount of the scholarly backlash to Saez and Zucman.
From a laypersonâ€™s perspective, perhaps the biggest thing you should know is the point Columbia University economist Wojciech Kopczuk makes in this slide from his presentation on the book: There are a lot of different ways to do these estimates, and they lead to very different conclusions. Work by Gerald Auten of the Treasury Department and David Splinter of Congressâ€™s Joint Committee on Taxation, for example, has reached very different conclusions from the better-known Piketty/Saez/Zucman findings on taxes and inequality (primarily that the increase in inequality has been much less dramatic) and those findings themselves are different from what Saez and Zucman now say.
Government transfers are very important
Meanwhile, the reason this debate is interesting to regular people is that itâ€™s relevant to contemporary politics. But in crucial ways itâ€™s not clear that the fact (or perhaps fake fact) that played such a heavy role in the marketing of the book is all that relevant to policy. You could make the chart of rich peopleâ€™s taxes over time look much â€œbetterâ€ by adopting policies that progressives like Saez and Zucman would strongly oppose, which suggests the chart isnâ€™t a great barometer for policy.
The payroll taxes that finance Social Security are flat for the first $132,900 that a person earns and then the rate drops to zero percent. Whatâ€™s more, the tax falls only on wage income â€” exempting interests, dividends, capital gains, and other forms of income that are earned primarily by the wealthy. Rich people, in other words, uncontroversially pay a much lower share of their income in Social Security taxes than do working-class people. Consequently, if you completely eliminated Social Security, then the American tax code would end up looking more progressive.
This is not, however, a policy view that Saez and Zucman or any other progressive supports.
The main things they are trying to argue for are a crackdown on corporationsâ€™ use of tax avoidance and the creation of a new wealth tax. Those are ideas that, if implemented, would change the shape of the Saez/Zucman tax curve and make it clearly progressive. But the case for or against those ideas really stands or falls on issues that donâ€™t have much to do with the chart.
Everything hinges on a big capital taxation debate
There are a lot of technical and practical differences between dividend and capital gains taxes, wealth taxes, estate taxes, and corporate income taxes, but they are all trying to tax capital, rather than labor or consumption.
Since ownership of capital is highly concentrated, capital taxation is a way of raising revenue from the people who will least miss the money. But there is a long tradition in economics of thinking that taxing capital is a bad idea, except perhaps as an emergency measure to finance a war or stave off an imminent government default crisis.
As with everything in economics, there are a lot of complicated arguments and mathematical models about this, but the basic idea is that financial capital is a representation of real things â€” office buildings, factories, machines, restaurants, inventions â€” that people use to do their jobs and create more value. If you tax capital, youâ€™ll end up with less of that stuff, and the country as a whole will end up a lot poorer.
Zucman and Saez argue that for the purposes of drawing a chart about how much taxes people pay, this kind of secondary economic impact should be ignored â€” just as they ignore the fact that Social Security taxes fund useful benefits.
The key thing, however, is that Zucman and Saez also believe that the traditional argument against capital taxation is wrong. They argue in the book that â€œover the last hundred years, there is no observable correlation between capital taxation and capital accumulationâ€ and that models positing big economic impacts of the kind of taxes they favor are ungrounded in empirical reality. Instead of taxes on the rich, they say, â€œthe more important ... forces are the regulations that affect private savings behavior.â€
These assertions, rather than the chart that served as the anchor of the public debate, are in practice the key arguments of the book. If itâ€™s true that higher taxes on capital significantly reduce economic growth and broadly impoverish everyone, as conservatives believe, then theyâ€™re probably a bad idea regardless of the impact on inequality.
But if thatâ€™s not true and we can finance lots of useful public services by taking money away from people who are indisputably very rich, then thatâ€™s probably a good idea, regardless of exactly how high a tax rate we think theyâ€™re already paying."
"Democrats have a clear theory of how theyâ€™ll make the economy fairer, but do they have a theory for making it grow faster?
Republicans have dominated the narrative on economic growth in recent decades. The right-wing conventional wisdom has been that while government regulations and higher taxes might help save the whales and feed the poor, the real prescription for growing the economy is deregulation, tax cuts, and a pro-market bent. Then â€” voila â€” prosperity. President Donald Trump says â€œwhether you love me or hate me, you have to vote for meâ€ to keep the good times going.
In recent years, progressives have developed a critique of the Republican vision of growth: Even when the GDP numbers are strong, the prosperity isnâ€™t being shared. Income inequality has exploded, wages have stagnated, and the richest Americans are hoarding wealth while everyone else struggles to keep up. In the landscape of supposed trickle-down economics, a lot of people are still waiting on that trickle.
â€œGrowth where a relatively small portion of the population reaps all the gains from that growth, thatâ€™s not the idea of a healthy, fair, or just society,â€ said Darrick Hamilton, the executive director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University. â€œGrowth in and of itself says nothing about morality, common humanity, or sustainability.â€
When it comes to a plan for growing the economy on the left, it gets more complicated. One answer is that an agenda for redistribution is an agenda for growth. Redistribution increases the resources available to most everyone, and what is growth but an increase in material resources?
But a vision aimed more directly at economic growth is forming among progressives as well â€” one that entails restructuring markets to change how they work and who they reward, rather than simply redistributing their benefits after the fact. The argument Democrats are beginning to make is that growth is weaker than it could be because the markets themselves are rigged. To accelerate the economy, youâ€™ve got to unrig the markets.
â€œThe rules of the game make a big difference,â€ said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate economist at Columbia University and author of People, Power, and Profits, a book outlining a vision for progressive capitalism.

What kind of economic growth are we really talking about?
Typically, we measure economic growth by gross domestic product (GDP), which is basically a measure of the goods and services produced in the US during a certain period of time and a sign of the health â€” or lack thereof â€” of the economy. The problem with that metric, many progressives say, is that it tells too basic a story and it misses nuances in the way people live.
â€œMany people implicitly assume that if thereâ€™s growth, then most peopleâ€™s income will grow,â€ said UC Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman in an email. â€œBut this has no reason to be true, and indeed this is not what has happened since 1980: Over the last 40 years, average income per adult has grown 1.4 percent in the US, but for the bottom 50 percent of the income distribution, income has completely stagnated.â€
According to Zucmanâ€™s research with fellow economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, from 1980 to 2014, only the top 10 percent of earners saw their incomes improve above the average for the rest of the country. For the bottom 90 percent, their incomes grew much more slowly.
Thereâ€™s no single explanation for how this has happened but rather a litany of policies and decisions that, over time, have contributed to income stratification in the US. Weâ€™ve implemented tax systems and regulatory regimes that have often benefited corporations and the wealthy and taken a lax attitude toward fostering competition in business, meaning more power has been concentrated in the hands of fewer corporations. Weâ€™ve seen weaker unions, wage stagnation, less innovation, and lower productivity as a result.

The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a think tank based in Washington, DC, has argued that we need to â€œdisaggregate growth.â€ Theyâ€™ve called for a new way of measuring growth thatâ€™s cognizant of inequality, and congressional Democrats have proposed it in legislation. Though the bill has not advanced, the Commerce Department has said the Bureau of Economic Analysis is researching methods to develop such a measure and will publish a prototype in 2020.
More broadly, there is a sense on the left that the concept of growth has to encompass more. â€œGrowth in median income, poverty rates, life expectancy, rates of morbidity, the employment to population ratio among prime-age adults â€” these measures seem equally important to me and by these metrics things have stalled even more than per capita income or are even going backward,â€ said Princeton economist Ilyana Kuziemko.
A progressive vision means teasing out the difference between growth and redistribution â€” and finding where thereâ€™s overlap
Beyond the issue of inequality and figuring out where growth is and isnâ€™t happening, thereâ€™s the question of growth-fostering policies. Redistribution may help lift people out of poverty and make for a fairer society, but the economy ultimately sputters out without growth. You canâ€™t give everyone bigger slices of a pie that isnâ€™t getting bigger itself.
The economic puzzle of the era is that we feel like weâ€™re living a moment of rapid technological change but productivity growth is actually slower than its post-war norm.
Part of the answer, argued Harvard economist Dani Rodrik in an email, is that innovation is being bottled up in a small set of firms â€” largely in metropolitan areas â€” while the rest of the economy falls behind. â€œThe only way to make the economy grow faster is to make sure that the lagging regions, firms, and segments of workers are connected more tightly with the advanced sectors,â€ Rodrik said. â€œWhen that is done, we get both greater equity and more growth.â€
Rodrik wants policies that directly target production, labor markets, and innovation systems, such as labor and antitrust policies that curb corporate concentration and government investments that explicitly target job-creating technologies, not just direct redistribution.
Part of the strategy for growth on the left isnâ€™t just boosting the economy but also removing some of the weights that are slowing it down: the cost of health care, student loan debt, and child poverty. â€œItâ€™s very key, and it makes sense that making sure people have access to education and health and security has really great consequences, because then they roll off and benefit everyone in a growth manner,â€ said Roosevelt Institute fellow Mike Konczal.
Of course, the question of trade-offs is always in the background. The Green New Deal, for example, is not, on its face, a pro-growth plan. But progressives would argue that the effects of climate change arenâ€™t being contemplated in GDP right now, and in the long term the consequences of climate change will be disastrous, both for people and economies. Nothing would do more for our future growth than preventing that catastrophe.

The progressive agenda has critics on the right but also some new allies
Of course, those on the conservative end of the spectrum are less than enthused by the progressive vision for economic growth. While a Republican agenda hasnâ€™t injected the economy with an unprecedented level of prosperity in recent decades, they argue that a Democratic one wonâ€™t do that well, either â€” and that the approach progressives advocate is part of what is weighing the economy down.
Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told me he believes the leftâ€™s focus on inequality is â€œmisplacedâ€ and doesnâ€™t solve the broader problem of productivity.
â€œIf we were to wave a magic wand tomorrow and reduce the income or the wealth of the top 20 percent by 50 percent, inequality would shrink dramatically, but the bottom half of income earners would still have the same skills, they would still have the same labor force participation rate, they would still face the same challenges in the workforce as they do now,â€ he said.
As for the idea that the market environment is so concentrated itâ€™s stifling competition, critics note that the companies that dominate today took down firms that were previously considered to be unstoppable behemoths. Before there was Amazon, there was Walmart. Before there was the Apple iPhone, there was BlackBerry. Before Facebook, MySpace. Before Google, Netscape.
â€œThereâ€™s some whining about the current situation that comes from businesses who are not just losing because theyâ€™re not as efficient as some newer or bigger competitors,â€ said libertarian Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron. â€œBut capitalism is not supposed to be helping the capitalist.â€
There is a growing strain on the right, however, that is converging more with the left in the belief that corporate power and inequality are increasingly problematic and a more active role for government is important. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has emerged as a fierce critic of Big Tech, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) appears to have taken an interest in industrial policy.
â€œThereâ€™s a renewed interest in how you have a more active role of government in promoting key industries,â€ said Nell Abernathy, vice president of strategy and policy for the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank.

Trump gives progressives the opportunity to think bigger on the economy; the question is whether they will take it
Democrats have for decades ceded much of the growth narrative to Republicans, who have over and over again tried to show that their formula works best. Except it doesnâ€™t. Case in point: The GOP just spent $1.5 trillion on a tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy and corporations, and itâ€™s still not creating some giant bump in GDP, let alone addressing income inequality or boosting poor Americans as much as it is the rich.
â€œIn almost every dimension, it slowed growth and increased inequality,â€ Stiglitz said.
But some on the left say that the price tag on the tax cuts is an argument for Democrats to think bigger. The conventional formula for growth hasnâ€™t been working out in the past 40 years, and Democrats who have tried to work incrementally and find consensus with Republicans havenâ€™t brought about much prosperity, either. Why not go for the structural change Elizabeth Warren is promoting? Or Bernie Sandersâ€™s political revolution? Why not embrace aggressive measures and policies that could really change the economy, ideas that arenâ€™t just focused on redistribution but also on growth?
â€œWhat we have demonstrated both from this Trump tax cut and the last Great Recession is the government has the capacity to do big things,â€ Hamilton said."
"Californiaâ€™s Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) is the nationâ€™s largest electric utility. It is also, at the moment, the nationâ€™s least favorite, as the state suffers through a relentless succession of wildfires and blackouts. The latest blackout is over for now. The fires continue.
In a series of posts on Californiaâ€™s mess, I have written about its many causes, some key steps the state can take to reduce its vulnerability, and what I think is the only durable long-term solution: a more localized, distributed energy system.
In this fourth and final post, Iâ€™m going to take a look at a way utilities like PG&E can be restructured to better serve the needs of California communities in the 21st century.
In a nutshell, the state needs utilities that partner with communities to maximize local resilience and self-sufficiency, and whose financial fortunes are tied to their performance in that pursuit.
Power utilities are a notoriously arcane and complex subject â€” be warned, there are lots of acronyms ahead â€” so to get our heads around why and how PG&E must be reformed, letâ€™s start with a little background.
Investor-owned utilities were designed for the 20th century, which is (checks watch) over
The investor-owned utility (IOU) model was designed in the early 20th century to draw private capital into the project of electrifying the country, building out grid infrastructure to reach every American.
As I explained in detail in this post, IOUs make money for shareholders by investing in stuff, mostly grid infrastructure, and receiving a guaranteed rate of return on those investments. The more grid infrastructure is needed, the more they can invest, and the higher their returns.
It was an effective model (more or less) in the 20th century; electricity has reached everyone. But it is the 21st century now, the century of the climate change crisis, and the giant machine that was built to distribute electricity â€” a system of exposed overhead power lines that travel hundreds of miles over land â€” is more and more vulnerable to the rise in extreme weather.
Seemed like a good idea at the time. Shutterstock
The imperative now is to reduce dependence on that increasingly brittle system, to strengthen the resilience and independence of local communities by enabling them to generate, store, and manage more of their own power.
If IOUs make their money from investing in the grid, it follows that it is against the fiduciary obligations of IOU executives to do or approve anything that might result in less grid infrastructure. They can be forced by statute or regulation to invest in X amount of energy efficiency, energy storage, or microgrids, but as long as they are structured the way they are, they will never do more than X. They will not be true partners in decentralizing and decarbonizing the grid.
To put it simply, the public interest and the profit structure of IOUs have slipped out of sync and are now in conflict.
Until recently, most of the action in electricity was on the transmission side
In the 20th century model, electricity is generated at large power plants and fed into high-voltage transmission lines, which carry it over long distances. At various points along the way, power is dumped from the transmission system into local distribution areas via substations, where transformers lower the voltage. Local distribution grids then carry the electricity to customers.
In that model, distribution grids just arenâ€™t that interesting. They, like the customers they serve, are largely passive recipients of energy. Once enough power to meet demand is dumped in and delivered, the utilityâ€™s job is largely taken care of. Most of the action in the electricity system has been on the transmission side.
In many states, including California, the transmission system was â€œderegulatedâ€ in the late 1990s, which meant that wholesale power generation became a competitive market. What were once â€œvertically integratedâ€ utilities, responsible for power generation, transmission, and delivery, were broken apart into three separate functions.
Distribution utilities (like PG&E) run distribution grids and deliver power to customers. Generation companies own power plants and sell into wholesale power markets. And transmission systems are run by regional transmission organizations and independent service operators â€” in Californiaâ€™s case, CAISO.
RTOs and ISOs in North America. FERC
CAISO doesnâ€™t own power plants. It doesnâ€™t own transmission lines, either (PG&E still owns and operates the lines and towers in its territory). Its only function is to oversee wholesale power markets and operate the transmission system. Like all regional transmission organizations and independent service operators, it is required by law to provide â€œfair and open accessâ€ to wholesale markets, which theoretically means that any power generator, no matter the technology, can bid in. CAISO follows a â€œload orderâ€ that prioritizes energy efficiency and demand response first, then renewables, then everything else.
Californiaâ€™s process of electricity deregulation was notoriously disastrous, but over time and with some better rules, wholesale markets have worked out pretty well, in California and in other states. They remain contentious â€” many of the biggest fights in electricity are over the rules that govern them and the way different sources are compensated within them â€” but they are largely a known quantity.
These days, the coolest stuff is happening on the distribution side
Things have been changing recently in the electricity system, shifting more of the action to the distribution side â€” operations in local communities.
The most obvious change is the rise in distributed energy resources, most notably rooftop solar panels. In 2006, there were about 20,000 rooftop solar systems installed in California. This year, that number crossed 1,000,000, and to keep momentum going, the state has mandated that all new home construction include solar.
The growth of rooftop solar is kickstarting a similar cycle of growth in batteries meant to store grid power, either â€œbehind the meter,â€ in customer buildings, or â€œin front of the meter,â€ in the form of community battery banks. A market report from Wood Mackenzie finds that in 2018, California took a decisive lead among US states in both behind-the-meter storage and in overall energy storage, and that lead is expected to grow for the next five years, yielding almost 7 GW total in 2024.
Wood Mackenzie
Some of that energy storage will be in the form of big, grid-scale battery banks hooked directly to power plants, on the transmission system. But the bulk of it will be on the distribution side of the grid.
Solar and batteries will be complemented by smart inverters that can â€œislandâ€ microgrids off from the larger grid, energy management controls and software that help coordinate onsite generation and consumption, â€œsmart appliancesâ€ that can shift their energy usage based on circumstances, and electric vehicles that can exchange energy with the microgrid. (See my previous post for more on distributed energy.)
This is a lot of new energy generation and management at the distribution level, a phenomenon that is only going to expand, and right now it is poorly coordinated, if at all, with PG&Eâ€™s management of the larger grid. It is also poorly coordinated, if at all, with the larger social, economic, and environmental goals of the communities in which it is located. Utilities arenâ€™t helping communities do that kind of planning, and they arenâ€™t sharing the data and information necessary for communities to do it themselves.
Local communities need partners to help them plan around their distribution grids
Whatâ€™s also important to keep in mind is that California has all kinds of ambitious targets: expanding renewable energy, expanding energy storage, increasing electric vehicles, electrifying heating and cooling, increasing housing density, building out public transportation, and above all, radically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
All of these programs and mandates are going to play out at the local level; thatâ€™s where the rubber hits the road. Dealing with these multiple incentives, restrictions, and requirements requires integrated planning, so that all the varying goals and initiatives operating at the local level are working in harmony.
The imperative to electrify heating and transportation means that all these municipal systems are increasingly going to be interconnected by distribution grids. In order to plan properly around state and local goals, municipalities need a partner that can help them plan for, and around, their local distribution grids, ensuring that all these resources are coordinated.
PG&E has no regulatory incentive to be that partner. It is obliged by its charter to provide reliable, low-cost electricity to everyone, which in its eyes involves buying power from the bulk power system and delivering it to customers. Beyond that, it is focused on producing returns for shareholders by, as described earlier, maximizing investment in the grid.

As weâ€™ve seen in the past month, PG&E is failing even at its core obligation of reliably delivering power. But even if it mostly restores service, it has no regulatory mandate (or financial incentive) to go beyond that and help with distribution-level planning. It has no mandate to provide differentiated services to local areas based on their individual circumstances.
This is the basic problem. PG&E has its eyes on the bulk power system â€” buying enough power, cheaply enough, and dumping it into local distribution areas. Whatâ€™s needed is a utility invested in the health and resilience of distribution grids, working to build a bottom-up power system to complement (and relieve pressure on) the current top-down system.
That brings us to a radical plan to reform PG&E.
A distributed utility for a distributed energy system
Lorenzo Kristov, who spent years as a market design principal at CAISO, has a plan to restructure IOUs. I have written about it in some detail, if you want the full wonky details (and some cool illustrations). He, along with the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, has submitted comments to the CPUC laying out why such a plan is necessary and feasible for PG&E.
Here, Iâ€™ll just offer the short version.
Before the transmission system was deregulated in California, utilities served two transmission functions. They managed the system itself, how and where electrons moved on it, and they provided the power that the system distributed.
Afterward, those functions were split. CAISO took over managing the transmission system, making sure it operated an effective, reliable, open-access platform for competitive wholesale power markets. Generation companies took over providing power to those markets.
At the distribution level, those same two functions exist. On one hand, there is the entity that manages the grid: the distribution system operator. On the other hand, there is the entity that sells power to customers: the load-serving entity, or LSE. (I told you to expect acronyms.)
For most customers in PG&E territory, one entity â€” namely PG&E â€” plays both those roles, though the roles are visible on electricity bills as separate grid and energy charges.
From a grid-architecture explainer. Javier Zarracina
Kristov wants those functions formally split, just the way they were in the transmission system. The distribution system operator would manage distribution grids as open-access platforms for local energy markets (Kristov thus calls it an â€œOA-DSOâ€), but own no energy assets and play no role in selling energy to customers. Independent energy companies would take over the role of LSEs, competing to sell energy and energy services to customers.
To be clear, this would be a big, revolutionary change. It would require some serious foresight and planning by California legislators and regulators. (Kristov has some thoughts on safe, incremental ways these reforms could get started.) But the time to make that plan is now, while PG&E is in bankruptcy and fundamental reforms are possible. It is imperative that the company not emerge from bankruptcy with the same anachronistic structure.
Weâ€™ll get into the benefits of this new model in a moment, but first itâ€™s important to note that, though it is a big change, something like this change is inevitable, because the current model is falling apart.
Developments afoot in California have already doomed the conventional utility model
When it deregulated its transmission system, California also briefly deregulated its distribution side. PG&E was to be the distribution system operator on all its distribution grids, but in theory, any customer could choose a different load-serving entity, purchasing power from a third-party electric service provider.
In practice, though, deregulation was poorly done: energy prices spiked, there were a bunch of scams at the retail level, Enron blew up in everyoneâ€™s faces, retail electricity re-regulated, and everyone got spooked by the whole idea of electricity deregulation for a decade. Many remain wary to this day.
Recently, though, things have started moving again on the distribution side, via Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), a law in California (and a few other states) that allows municipalities served by IOUs to become their own load-serving entities, thus taking over procuring and providing power for their citizens, while the utility retains the distribution system operator role. Two or more jurisdictions can also link together and create a Joint Powers Authority that runs a CCA on their collective behalf.
Municipalities typically opt for CCAs because they want cleaner and/or cheaper power than the utility provides, and they can often find both relatively easily. There will be almost 30 CCAs operating in California by 2020; the largest, the Clean Power Alliance, now serves more than 3 million people across 31 communities.
CALCCA
CCAs are becoming so popular in California that they are threatening the IOUs from which they are defecting. (Thatâ€™s why IOUs are trying to hike up â€œexit feesâ€ on communities that choose to form CCAs.)
Last year, the CPUC issued issued a report on CCAs in which it revealed that, between CCAs, rooftop solar, and participants in the stateâ€™s Direct Access program (which allows commercial customers to buy from independent power providers), â€œas much as 25% of IOU retail electric load will be effectively unbundled and served by a non-IOU source or provider sometime later this year. This share is expected to grow quickly over the coming decade.â€
Californiaâ€™s IOUs could end up losing most of their load. Now that San Diego has announced its intention to form a CCA, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) is facing the loss of 40 percent of its total load, which could leave it stranded with big power contracts it no longer needs. (For complicated reasons, there is no way to neatly transfer those contracts to a CCA.)
PG&E expects CCAs to eat 46 percent of its demand this year. By the end of the decade, it could lose almost all its load, with the only communities left buying power directly from them the ones too poor or scattered to form a CCA.
There are complicated issues to work out around how to make this transition equitable, but itâ€™s looking inevitable. SDG&E is already contemplating becoming a pure â€œwiresâ€ company, i.e., a pure distribution service operator. It has already asked state lawmakers for â€œlegislation that would allow us to begin planning a glide path out the energy procurement space.â€ It even floated legislation to that effect.
PG&E faces the same decision and will likely end up on the same glide path. Already, itâ€™s being pushed. In a filing to the CPUC, community-choice groups argued that the utility should become wires-only. In its own filing, PG&E expressed openness to considering the idea, though it said the proposal would â€œpose several challenges and take considerable time to implement.â€ One concern is that under the proposal, PG&E would no longer serve its role as energy provider of last resort, which could leave customers stranded if their energy providers go under (more on that later).
Kevin Stark has a great rundown on all this over at GTM, and he notes one aspect of the dynamic that is relevant to our discussion here:
The [CCA] groups are also asking for local control over a wide range of energy programs from demand response, to energy efficiency measures, to electric vehicle initiatives. Power generation aside, it would be a big lift for the aggregators to assume control of the teams of people that manage these programs and interact with customers and the software that allow them to operate.
This brings us back to the difficulty described in the previous section. Local communities increasingly want to take control of integrated energy planning, but they often lack the capacity to do so, and they do not have a willing partner in their electric utility.
Kristovâ€™s reforms are designed to address precisely those problems, and as such, they are a spur to the spread of CCAs.
You should really read that grid-architecture explainer. Javier Zarracina/Vox
The benefits of an OA-DSO
Kristovâ€™s model is a version of a wires-only utility, but a more sophisticated one that addresses some common concerns.
The idea is that PG&Eâ€™s responsibility for distribution grids would be separated, by regulation, from its role as energy service provider (which would be taken over by local distributed-energy markets) and its role as owner and operator of transmission assets. In each distribution grid, or local group of distribution grids, PG&E would create an open-access distribution service operator â€” an OA-DSO.
An OA-DSO would effectively be a local utility. But while it would plan and operate the local grid and deal with customer communication and billing, it would not own any energy assets or provide any energy services.
Instead, it would oversee local markets for energy services, from electricity to efficiency to resiliency (i.e., backup power in a blackout). Just as regional transmission organizations/independent service operators are required by regulation to provide fair and open access to the transmission system, an OA-DSO would be required to provide fair and open access to the distribution grid, for any third-party entity with energy services to sell.
Crucially, while OA-DSOs would still make money the way current distribution utilities do â€” by investing in grid infrastructure and receiving a guaranteed rate of return â€” that rate of return would be much lower, and much closer to the actual cost of capital. To make up the gap in revenue, an OA-DSO would receive variable compensation based on its achievement of performance metrics: system uptime, energy efficiency, percentage of renewable energy, electrification, customer satisfaction, etc. The metrics can be decided by regulators and local communities.
In the energy-nerd world, this is known as â€œperformance-based regulation,â€ and, yes, they call it PBR. The core feature of performance-based regulation is that it ties IOU profits to quality of service rather than to quantity of investment. It brings the utility profit motive back into alignment with the social, environmental, and economic goals of California communities.
Each OA-DSO a kingdom unto itself. Javier Zarracina/Vox
But thereâ€™s a catch: Even with an OA-DSO present to serve as a partner in distribution-grid planning, many communities donâ€™t yet have a CCA, and still lack the information and capacity to engage meaningfully in that kind of planning.
To address that problem, Kristov is working with the Climate Centerâ€™s Clean Power Exchange to advance an initiative meant to help build local energy-planning capacity. Advanced Community Energy (ACE) would â€œestablish, through legislation, a program to provide funding, technical expertise, best practices and local capacity building for all cities and counties to plan and implement local ACE systems, starting with community microgrids.â€
The planning ACE envisions would bring together â€œlocal government agencies, local residents and stakeholders, especially vulnerable households and disadvantaged neighborhoods, electric distribution utilities [OA-DSOs], and clean energy developers and technology companies.â€
That is the kind of integrated local planning CCA communities want, and ACE legislation would be an enormous boon to them. But the legislation is also meant to reach communities that donâ€™t yet have CCAs and still need to do local distribution planning.
As I warned in my previous post, if the state doesnâ€™t intervene, California is in danger of lurching into a distributed energy system in an unsafe, inequitable way â€” basically, wealthier people will get it first and leave poorer people stranded on a more expensive, less stable grid. ACE is meant to get out ahead of that, to provide every community with the tools to maximize its local resources and plan the future it wants.
Good local planning, with a willing partner in an OA-DSO, can take into account multiple considerations, among them local needs and priorities, equity, state standards and mandates, and service to the larger grid system (local microgrids can help flatten out peaks and valleys in demand, the notorious â€œduck curve,â€ making for a more stable grid).
Each LDAâ€™s local energy will create a â€œduck curveâ€ in demand that microgrids can help smooth out. CAISO
In effect, the OA-DSO + ACE model would encourage each local distribution grid to treat itself like a microgrid, to balance and maximize its own local resources before turning to power from the transmission grid. Just as CAISO must put clean resources first in its wholesale-market load order, the OA-DSO would put clean, local resources first in its retail-market load order. Grid power would be the last resort, not the first.
Notably, the way Kristov has structured his proposal to the CPUC avoids some of the problematic aspects of other wires-only proposals. It seeks to minimize the lift, to target its changes and leave other controversial issues aside.
He is open, for instance, to PG&E keeping its role as power provider of last resort, which would involve maintaining some power-procurement contracts for backup. Unlike some other reformers, his proposal would not require that PG&E divest itself of its transmission assets, only that it be separated by regulation from the DSO function. (The Clean Coalition, a state nonprofit that advocates for local energy, argues that â€œtransmission divestmentâ€ is the only way to force PG&E to focus entirely on distribution grids.)
Finally, the OA-DSO model is agnostic on the question of ownership structure. It could work just as well if PG&E becomes a public utility or a collection of municipal utilities, but crucially, it need not wait on those reforms (which could take many years). It can be implemented now, no matter who ends up owning PG&E.
California can become a model of a more robust and resilient energy system
The best way for California communities to become more resilient in the face of wildfires, blackouts, and god-knows-what-else in the age of climate change is to maximize their local resources through coherent local planning that includes the increasingly important element of distribution-grid planning.
The OA-DSO + ACE model would provide for that kind of planning and spur the growth of a bottom-up energy system.
This distributed energy system would not replace the bulk power system, with its big power plants and long transmission lines. Long-distance grids are fantastically useful machines and will be much-needed for full decarbonization. Thereâ€™s nothing wrong with being interdependent on a larger system, in electricity, trade, or anything else.
But as recent events in California have shown, it is also useful to be able to island off from those larger systems in times of emergency or breakdown â€” to operate independently, at least enough to provide for basic community needs.
Good distribution-level planning will create microgrids within microgrids, each able to island from the level above, so that the system is more modular and less vulnerable to single points of failure. It will tie together solar panels, batteries, heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electric vehicle chargers with smart controls and software. It will bring economic development, jobs, and innovation to local communities. And a bottom-up energy system will complement and ease the pressure on Californiaâ€™s increasingly shaky and vulnerable top-down system.
But it is only possible if utilities become partners in the effort. That will require fundamental change in the regulatory structure now governing PG&E, to bring its financial interests in sync with the social, environmental, and economic interests of California communities.
California legislators, regulators, and bankruptcy courts should not shy away from this kind of reform because it is bold. If the current apocalypse in California is not occasion for boldness, what could be? Now â€” while PG&E is bankrupt, exposed, and open to change â€” is the time to remake it for the 21st century."
"An hour before the Houseâ€™s Thursday vote formally laying out the process of the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the House floor to set the tone: resolute, yet somber.
â€œThis is something that is very solemn,â€ Pelosi said, standing next to a posterboard of the American flag. â€œNobody ... comes to Congress to impeach a president of the United States.â€
The pivotal resolution passed the House 232 to 196. Two moderate Democrats, Reps. Collin Peterson (D-MN) and Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ) voted against the resolution, joining all House Republicans. Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI), who recently left the Republican Party, voted in favor.
Thursdayâ€™s vote showed how far a once-splintered Democratic caucus has come on impeachment. A few months ago, many Democrats including Pelosi didnâ€™t want to broach the subject â€” saying the public clearly didnâ€™t support it. But the explosive revelations that Trump had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, and allegations the president tied that demand to US military aid changed everything.
As evidence has mounted and Trump administration officials has come forward to testify in front of House committees, public support for impeachment has grown, according to polling tracking from FiveThirtyEight.

Democrats on the impeachment committees say the resolution will allow the American public to witness what committee members have seen behind closed doors over the past six weeks. They plan to call career administration officials who have served in both Republican and Democratic administrations as witnesses.
Public hearings are expected to begin in two to three weeks, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA), who sits on one of the committees leading the inquiry, told Vox.
â€œI think there are a number of witnesses here who are incredibly believable,â€ Lynch told Vox outside the House floor Thursday. â€œThereâ€™s a lot there. With the quality of the evidence and the quality of the witnesses, thereâ€™s a substantial body of work here thatâ€™s weâ€™ve produced in the last six weeks.â€
â€œWe still got more interviews to conduct,â€ said Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX), a moderate Republican who sits on the House Intelligence Committee.
For months, as calls for an impeachment inquiry in the House has escalated among Democrats, Pelosi has been a voice of caution, warning impeachment could be too divisive. But on Thursday, Pelosi appeared no longer interested in these concerns.
â€œWe cannot ignore, and we will not ignore when the presidentâ€™s behavior indicates that investigation, that inquiry is necessary,â€ Pelosi said. â€œAs the inquiry proceeds, weâ€™ll decide whether weâ€™ll go forward with impeachment, that decision has not been made.â€
At a press conference before the vote, she closed her remarks with the hint of a smile: â€œI have business on the floor that I have to see to,â€ Pelosi told reporters, on her way to take the Speakerâ€™s chair on the House floor.
The political tide on impeachment has officially changed
For months before the Ukraine scandal broke, Pelosi had been hesitant to wade into a full-blown impeachment inquiry, fearing it could put moderate Democratic lawmakers in danger ahead of the 2020 elections.
But the Ukraine scandal changed everything. The focus on Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry hasnâ€™t faded. Instead, a steady stream of witnesses have come forward to talk to lawmakers, sharing grave concerns around Trumpâ€™s behavior. Thursdayâ€™s vote demonstrated a substantial amount of unity within the Democratic caucus on impeachment.
Just two moderate Democrats ultimately defected, including Van Drew, who was first elected in November. Hours before the vote, another lawmaker who had previously been an impeachment holdout, Rep. Kendra Horn (D-OK), announced she would vote for the resolution.

Van Drew, however, told reporters he viewed the whole exercise as a waste of time. Trump won Van Drewâ€™s district in 2016, and Van Drew flipped the district from Republican to Democrat in a surprisingly tight race in 2018. The former dentist whose district includes Atlantic City, has long been a vocal opponent of the inquiry (earning praise from none other than Trump).
â€œI think this splits the country apart further, it is only about 13 months until an election,â€ the Democrat, wearing a pinstripe suit, told a scrum of reporters. â€œLetâ€™s let the people choose. let them impeach if they want to impeach. I donâ€™t think he will be convicted in the Senate, so we will have [put in] all this time, all this money all this energy all this effort, [for] a failed impeachment, the same president and the same presidential candidates.â€
Aside from Van Drew and fellow anti-impeachment moderate Collin Peterson, whose district Trump carried by 30 points in 2016, the broader caucus was firmly united in the final vote, an outcome that members of the party celebrated. â€œI didnâ€™t think there were any defections, really,â€ House oversight committee member John Sarbanes (D-MD) told Vox. â€œThere was this giant Democratic vote in support of it, I thought that was pretty awesome.â€
â€œEveryone in a vote of this magnitude has to do what they feel is right and whatâ€™s right for their constituents,â€ added Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), the vice-chair of the House Democratic Caucus.
Pelosiâ€™s own caution toward impeachment in the past has now become part of her pitch to the American public: that Democratsâ€™ slow inch toward a formal proceeding was part of a deliberative process. That, however, has not warded off Republicansâ€™ complaints.
This was a procedural vote. Republicans are still complaining about process.
Republicans took the floor one by one Thursday morning to call the investigation into Trump a scam, question Pelosiâ€™s leadership, and peg Democrats as shady, secretive agents desperately rushing to take down a political foe.
â€œTrying to put a ribbon on a sham process doesnâ€™t make it any less of a sham,â€ Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), one of Trumpâ€™s close allies and staunch defenders in the House said on the House floor ahead of the speech.
Republicans have been focused on a provision in the resolution around witnesses. The minority will be allowed to call up their own witnesses, but only if they submit â€œa detailed written justification of the relevanceâ€ of testimony and if either Schiff or a majority vote on the committee gives approval. The measure is one way Democrats are hoping to prevent Republicans from derailing proceedings. Itâ€™s also consistent with how such requests have been handled in prior impeachment probes.
Standing next to a poster with a hammer and sickles, Republican Minority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) called the House Democrats impeachment inquiry â€œ37 Days of Soviet-style impeachment proceedings,â€ to a round of applause from his Republican House colleagues.
â€œMaybe in the Soviet Union you do things like this where only you make the rules,â€ Scalise said. â€œWhere you reject the ability for the perp you are accusing to even be in the room, to question whatâ€™s going on.â€

For weeks Republicans were quick to point out that Democrats began conducting an investigation without voting on an impeachment resolution, skirting a traditional procedural step. Now, that Democrats have voted on the resolution â€” with near unanimity â€” Republicansâ€™ procedural talking points have shifted.
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) argued that the vote itself was indicative of how Democrats were abusing the process. â€œIâ€™m very dismayed by the process, even on the floor, that they wouldnâ€™t recognize the minority,â€ she told Vox. â€œWe need transparency.â€
Whatâ€™s next on impeachment
The resolution the House just passed lays out the procedures around public hearings. But thereâ€™s no set date for when those public hearings will start.
Rep. Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the House Oversight Committee and has been in the closed-door depositions, told Vox he expects public hearings to start in the next two to three weeks. Lawmakers are now headed home for a week of recess, which means they have two weeks to conduct public hearings before the Thanksgiving holiday.
Although many in the Democratic caucus once said they believed impeachment would be wrapped up by the end of the year, itâ€™s not clear if that timeline is achievable. Pelosi, for one, has not put any such timeline out.
Even though Thursdayâ€™s vote was momentous, Pelosi was still treading cautiously on the subject of whether Democrats would ultimately impeach the president.

â€œAs the inquiry proceeds, weâ€™ll decide whether weâ€™ll go forward with impeachment, that decision has not been made,â€ Pelosi told reporters.
More immediately, Lynch said there are still a few remaining details to be ironed out in the coming weeks; the committees conducting the impeachment inquiry want to speak to Trumpâ€™s former National Security Adviser John Bolton, and are still in a â€œtug of warâ€ with the State Department over documents theyâ€™ve requested. But Lynch told Vox he thinks the committees are building a solid case, which theyâ€™re preparing to make public.
â€œIt gives a lot of people plenty to think about,â€ Lynch said. â€œLike Speaker Pelosi, I wonâ€™t get ahead of that process, but the time with witnesses and the time with the evidence has been well-spent, and I think thereâ€™s a case to be made.â€

"Netflix has ruled the streaming video world for years. Now Apple, Disney, and other big companies are trying to change that: Theyâ€™d like to claim some of the time and money you give to Netflix â€” which has nearly 160 million subscribers worldwide â€” and theyâ€™re going to spend billions trying to make it happen.
Which is why youâ€™re hearing a lot right now about Appleâ€™s new streaming service, which launches Friday, and Disneyâ€™s, which launches a couple of weeks after that. And youâ€™ve probably heard about WarnerMediaâ€™s new take on HBO, which will come online in May but got a big debut this week.
Itâ€™s also why you may be confused about all of this. What is all of this stuff? How much do I pay for it? And do I want to watch any of it, anyway?
We hear you, dear reader and fellow binger. And we are here to help. Letâ€™s start explaining the Streaming Wars and why you should care about them.
Big picture first: The good news is that an astonishing amount of new entertainment is coming your way, delivered conveniently over the internet and funded by billions of dollars in spending from some of the biggest companies in the world.
The bad news: Some of the stuff you used to find easily in a few places, like on Netflix, is moving to other services, which will require more work, and eventually more money, to watch.
The other good news, for now: While some of this stuff will cost money, a lot of it will be free â€” or, at least, free for many people â€” because the giant companies that are spending billions on this stuff want to sign up new users as fast as they can as they try to catch up with Netflix. They can worry about charging you money (or more money) later. And if that doesnâ€™t work, theyâ€™ll try showing you ads.
That last point was driven home this week by AT&Tâ€™s WarnerMedia, the company formerly known as Time Warner: In May, WarnerMedia will launch HBO Max, a super-sized version of HBO, which will feature everything thatâ€™s already on HBO plus lots of old shows like Friends and new shows made just for the service. Eventually, WarnerMedia wants to charge more for that service than it does for HBO, which generally costs $15 a month. But for now, WarnerMedia will charge only $15 a month for HBO Max.
That price is part of WarnerMediaâ€™s plan to convert current HBO subscribers into HBO Max customers â€” which should not be a hard sell, considering itâ€™s offering all the new programming on HBO Max at no extra cost, for now. In the words of WarnerMedia CEO John Stankey, the deal is an â€œIQ testâ€ â€” meaning youâ€™re a dummy if you donâ€™t sign up for it. Perhaps his employees will use a slightly softer pitch when starting up their marketing campaign.
Now letâ€™s go through the new players chasing after Netflix:
Appleâ€™s Apple TV+, launching November 1
What is it? For now, itâ€™s a modest selection of big-budget TV shows, including The Morning Show, a fictionalized version of real-life infighting at NBC News that stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell; and See, a sort-of-Game-of-Thrones-looking adventure story starring Jason Momoa.
What does it cost? $5 per month.
What does it really cost? Apple is going to give away year-long subscriptions to the service to anyone who buys certain Apple hardware, most notably new iPhones. Which means many, many millions of people will have Apple TV+ subscriptions over the next year.
Do I want to watch it? The first batch of reviews for Appleâ€™s new shows have not been enthusiastic. But Apple will continue to roll out new shows every month. And, again, you will probably get it for free.
Why is Apple doing this? Because Appleâ€™s hardware sales are slowing, it is looking to generate more revenue from the sale of services, like Apple Music and App store purchases. $5 a month isnâ€™t a lot, but Apple has a lot of iPhone customers, which means that business could grow fairly large fairly quickly. And Apple wants to use Apple TV+ to attract users to its TV app, where it will sell subscriptions to other services, like HBO and Starz, and then take a cut from those transactions.
Disneyâ€™s Disney+, launching November 12
What is it? A very, very large selection of Disneyâ€™s movies and TV shows, including many of its Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar titles, as well older movies and new programs made exclusively for the service, like the Mandalorian, a big-budget Star Wars series.
What does it cost? $7 per month.
What does it really cost? Verizon has a deal with Disney which will give a year of Disney+ free to some of its customers, like those who get â€œunlimitedâ€ wireless data plans. Disney has also been offering discounts to customers who sign up for multi-year subscriptions, and it is offering a discount to customers who already pay for its ESPN+ sports streamer or for Hulu, the TV streaming service Disney recently acquired.
Do I want to watch it? If you are a kid or have a kid, probably. Also if you like Marvel movies, Star Wars movies, and Pixar movies.
Why is Disney doing this? Disney spent years renting its stuff to Netflix, and Netflix used those shows and movies to build a giant service. Now Disney is taking much of that stuff back from Netflix â€” and forgoing a lot of licensing money â€” to build a would-be Netflix rival â€” or, at least, a service that people will pay for in addition to Netflix.
WarnerMediaâ€™s HBO Max, launching May 2020
What is it? The HBO service you already know, plus a grab bag of stuff Warner controls but that you may not realize belongs to Warner. That means sitcoms like Friends and Big Bang Theory, and documentaries from CNN, and animation from its Cartoon Network. Warner is also spending big money to buy other peopleâ€™s stuff, like Viacomâ€™s South Park, and it is making its own programming for the service, like a show based on its DC Comicsâ€™ Green Lantern character.
What does it cost? $15 a month.
What does it really cost? AT&T says it will automatically offer HBO Max for free to the 10 million HBO customers who subscribed to the service through AT&T, plus anyone who signed up for the service directly via its HBO Now site; it will also offer it for free to some other customers who get a bundle of its wireless, broadband, and video services.
AT&T also wants to get HBO subscribers who have subscribed via other distributors, like Comcast or Apple, to transfer over automatically as well. But it will have to negotiate with each distributor for that to happen. You could also go ahead and do the work yourself by canceling your existing HBO subscription and signing up at the HBO Max site.
Do I want to watch it? Warner doesnâ€™t have the same instant brand appeal that Disney has. But Friends and Big Bang Theory are popular shows, and lots of other stuff in the HBO Max bundle will appeal to different audiences, like DC comics fans. And, again, Warner is hoping that it will be able to convert tens of millions of HBO subscribers simply by telling them that they can get the new service and all its additional content for no extra cost. (For now!)
Why is WarnerMedia doing this? AT&T paid more than $85 billion for Time Warner, and it believes it can make one of the worldâ€™s biggest entertainment companies even bigger by distributing much of its stuff over the internet directly to consumers â€” just like Netflix is doing and like Disney wants to do.
Comcastâ€™s Peacock, launching April 2020
What is it? Eventually, it will be a mix of shows that have recently aired on Comcastâ€™s NBCUniversal channels like NBC and Bravo. At the start, it will be older shows that have aired on NBCUniversal channels, like The Office, Saturday Night Live, and 30 Rock, plus NBCUniversal movies like Shrek, Knocked Up, and Meet the Parents â€” and exclusive new shows, like a second reboot of Battlestar Galactica from Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail. Plus ads.
What does it cost? Comcast will give the streaming service away to its 21 million pay TV subscribers. And it wants to give it away to pay TV subscribers on other platforms. It will also sell it directly to customers who donâ€™t have pay TV, though it hasnâ€™t yet announced that price.
What does it really cost? Expect Comcast to find a way to come in at that $5 to $7 range now that Disney and Apple have set their prices so low, but also expect a lot of giveaways, too.
Do I want to watch it? If you are used to watching NBC shows on Hulu (which NBC currently owns a piece of but wonâ€™t in a few years) or Netflix (which NBC has been selling its shows to for years), you probably will, since those shows will be migrating over to Peacock over time. And there are some zealous Battlestar Galactica fans.
Why is Comcast doing this? In part, because it had to: NBC used to use Hulu as its primary streaming distribution outlet for its TV shows, but that is going away as Disney takes control over the service. NBCUniversal thinks there will be a large audience interested in a â€œfreeâ€ service (if that audience gets pay TV) and wonâ€™t mind seeing ads. And the company thinks it can sell ads for the stuff it shows at much higher prices than other free, ad-supported options like YouTube or Facebook.
But wait! Thatâ€™s not all. As the new guys flood into your TV and phone screens, the old guys â€” that is, Netflix and Amazon, which has also been spending billions on streaming over the last few years â€” are retooling too, trying to find new ways to make more shows that appeal to even bigger audiences.
While theyâ€™re not giving their stuff away for free â€” Netflix subscriptions start at $9 a month in the US; Amazon makes its video available to subscribers to its Prime service, which sells for $119 a year â€” they wonâ€™t be able to raise prices anytime soon, because of the competition. This doesnâ€™t seem sustainable in the long term, and weâ€™re probably going to look back at this era as an amazing #content bubble. Enjoy it while it lasts.

"The House of Representatives approved its first resolution related to their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump in a Thursday morning vote.
This vote was not, of course, about whether Trump should be impeached. If that happens, it will come further down the road. Instead, the resolution before the House was a set of procedures proposed by Democratic leaders for how the impeachment inquiry will function going forward. You can read its text here.
The resolution passed by a vote of 232 to 196, almost entirely along party lines. Two Democrats â€” Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN) and Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ) â€” dissented from their party to vote no. Former Republican Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI), who left the party earlier this year, joined Democrats to vote yes. All current Republicans voted no.

This vote can be read as a sign that Democrats are ready to move to a new phase of the inquiry: Theyâ€™re winding down the closed-door depositions theyâ€™ve held in recent weeks and moving instead to hearings that will take place in public.
The resolution also makes clear who will take the lead in this phase: Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It tasks Schiffâ€™s committee with holding these public hearings and eventually writing a report. That report will be handed off to the House Judiciary Committee, which would draft articles of impeachment. But weâ€™re still a ways off from that.
Thursdayâ€™s vote is intriguing politically for two reasons. First, this is a vote that Pelosi has spent all year trying to stave off thanks to fear of putting vulnerable House Democrats from Trump-friendly districts in a tough spot.
Second, and relatedly, Republicans have spent weeks making the lack of this vote a key talking point in their criticisms of Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry. In fact, House rules do not require a vote to start such an inquiry, nor does the Constitution, as Voxâ€™s Ella Nilsen explained. But now that Democrats have decided to hold one anyway, Trumpâ€™s defenders will have to find some other process complaint to gripe about.
Why Pelosi has changed course and agreed to hold this vote isnâ€™t entirely clear, since it really isnâ€™t necessary for her to hold one. She could think Democrats now have the upper hand politically, with polls showing support for the impeachment process. She could want to take one of Republicansâ€™ main talking points off the table. Or she could simply think itâ€™s the right time to move the inquiry to a new phase.
Whatever her reasoning, it has cued up a major moment in political history: Today will be the day lawmakers take their first recorded vote on what will likely be the road to President Trumpâ€™s impeachment.
What House Democratsâ€™ impeachment procedures resolution actually does
Democratsâ€™ resolution is not a resolution to start an impeachment inquiry; the partyâ€™s position is that theyâ€™ve been conducting one for some time already. Instead, the resolution is framed as one â€œdirecting certain committees to continue their ongoing investigationsâ€ as part of an â€œexisting House of Representative inquiry into whether sufficient grounds existâ€ for the impeachment of President Trump. That is: The inquiry already existed and will continue.
The resolution does, however, lay out some specifics about how things will work going forward.

First, it says that open hearings will be held and, interestingly, the committee that will hold those hearings is the House Intelligence Committee, chaired by Schiff. That makes sense, because the whistleblower complaint made its way to Schiff in the first place (his committee oversees the intelligence community). And itâ€™s Schiffâ€™s committee that has been holding closed-door depositions of Trump administration officials for the past month (though members of two other committees, Foreign Relations and Oversight, have also been invited to take part).
Still, the move raised some eyebrows, because traditionally, the Judiciary Committee has taken the lead in impeachment. The gossip in Washington is that Pelosi has not been happy with how that committee, led by Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), has handled its public hearings this year. The resolution does signal a role for the Judiciary Committee eventually, though, as weâ€™ll see in a minute.

Second, the resolution gives some details on how those hearings will be conducted. The interesting part here is that Schiff (and the intelligence committeeâ€™s ranking member Devin Nunes) will each get to question witnesses at the beginning for longer than the traditional five minutes â€” up to 90 minutes in total. They can also designate staff members to do this questioning. This is not typically how congressional hearings are conducted but it would allow witnesses to be questioned for lengthier periods by skilled attorneys (rather than bloviating politicians).
Third, the resolution says that Nunes can ask for his own witnesses to be invited or subpoenaed to testify, but thereâ€™s a catch. Nunes must give â€œa detailed written justification of the relevanceâ€ of each witnessâ€™s testimony and either Schiff or a majority vote on the committee would have to approve it. This is an effort to prevent Republicans from playing political games by demanding that irrelevant witnesses appear.
Finally, the resolution makes clear how this phase of the impeachment inquiry will end: After Schiff has held public hearings, he will write a report laying out his findings and recommendations. Thatâ€™s when the handoff to Nadlerâ€™s Judiciary Committee will occur. The Judiciary Committee will review the report and draft impeachment articles if they deem that necessary (which they almost surely will).
How we got here
Democrats in the House of Representatives have been divided over whether to impeach Trump since their majority was sworn in in January â€” and those divisions have only recently subsided as the Ukraine scandal broke.
Activists and voters in the party have been demanding Trumpâ€™s impeachment for some time now for a variety of reasons: from bigotry to financial corruption to his general conduct in office. But at the beginning of this year, party leaders like Speaker Pelosi were wary of this pressure, for political reasons. Their hard-won majority depended on many members representing districts that had voted for Trump.
On March 4, 2019, Nadler announced that his Judiciary Committee would investigate â€œalleged obstruction of justice, public corruption, and other abuses of power by President Trump, his associates, and members of his Administration.â€ And for the months afterward, this was the Houseâ€™s main probe into the Mueller reportâ€™s findings and potential impeachment.
It was generally expected that, if Democrats decided they did want to seriously explore impeaching Trump, they would take the step of â€œopening a formal impeachment inquiry.â€ That is not something that is required by House rules â€” the Judiciary Committee can draw up and vote on impeachment articles whenever they want â€” but it is something the House did in advance of the impeachment efforts aimed at Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.
But they did not do this, and Nadler and other Judiciary Committee Democrats spent a few awkward months trying to signal to their base voters that they were serious about impeachment even though they continued to avoid the phrase â€œimpeachment inquiry.â€ (Some attempted to argue that they had started such an inquiry months ago.) The reason for these contortions seemed to be that Democratic leaders remained opposed to a formal inquiry.
It took a new scandal to shake things up. News of a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had pressured Ukraineâ€™s president to investigate the Biden family broke in September, and that led Pelosi to end the ambiguity. The speaker announced on September 24 that â€œthe House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.â€

Still, Pelosi showed no inclination to hold a vote of the full House over this. It wasnâ€™t practically necessary, and it would be most uncomfortable for those Democratic members in Trump-supporting districts. It took over a month for her to finally decide that it was indeed time to move forward and get the full House on record voting on this for the first time.
What happens next
Summing up, now that this resolution has been approved by the House, this is how the impeachment inquiry will proceed going forward:
Schiffâ€™s Intelligence Committee will hold public hearings and eventually write a report.
Nadlerâ€™s Judiciary Committee will then review that report and likely draft and vote on articles of impeachment for Trump.
Any articles of impeachment improved by the Judiciary Committee would then go before the full House for the actual vote on whether Trump would be impeached.
If Trump is impeached by the House then the Senate would hold a trial to determine whether to remove him from office.
It isnâ€™t clear how long each of these phases will last. Democrats had at one point hoped to hold their final votes on whether to impeach Trump before Thanksgiving, but that timeline has slipped. For now, they still appear to be aiming to wrap things up in the House before the end of the year."
"At a hearing over an investigation of Missouriâ€™s lone abortion clinic, a state official testified to something that has disturbed reproductive health advocates in the state and beyond: With the help of state medical records, his office had created a spreadsheet tracking patientsâ€™ menstrual periods.
The goal, according to the Kansas City Star, was to investigate â€œfailedâ€ abortions, instances in which the patient needed to return a second time to complete the procedure. The idea was apparently that, by gathering data on patientsâ€™ periods, state officials would know who was still pregnant after a scheduled abortion.
The testimony by Dr. Randall Williams, director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, came on Tuesday as part of a week-long hearing over whether the clinic, Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, will be allowed to keep its license to do abortions.
On Wednesday, the health department issued a statement to media blasting â€œfalse claims that Dr. Randall Williams tracks the menstrual cycles of women seeking abortions at Planned Parenthood.â€ However, the department acknowledged that officials had indeed created a spreadsheet to investigate failed abortions â€” it disputed only that Williams had requested such a spreadsheet.
The health department has held up the clinicâ€™s license over concerns about â€œdeficient practices,â€ and documentation of failed abortions appears to be one of those concerns. In its statement, the department acknowledged that officials used the spreadsheet to identify at least one instance where an abortion failed.
Abortion is â€œnot only very safe, but it works very well,â€ Dr. Kristyn Brandi, a family planning specialist at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, told Vox. But as with any medical procedure, â€œthere is a failure rateâ€ â€” around 1 to 5 percent, depending on the procedure used.
At the St. Louis Clinic, four out of more than 4,000 patients who received abortions remained pregnant after the procedure, according to the data made public at the hearing. Thereâ€™s no reason such a rate â€” less than one in 1,000 â€” should have concerned state officials, Brandi said: â€œIt sounds, actually, like a quite safe facility.â€
Failed abortions have become a focus of abortion opponents around the country in recent months, with President Trump and others claiming that infants are being born alive after abortion attempts and doctors are killing them (which experts say does not happen). But by using the narrative of abortion failure as an excuse to create a spreadsheet with patientsâ€™ periods, the health department is dragging their medical data into a larger effort aimed at shutting the clinic down, Planned Parenthood says.
â€œThe frightening reality is, as the DHSS Director, Randall Williams has access to abortion reports, which in this case included information on menstrual cycles of Missouri women,â€ Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement to Vox. â€œTo boil this down: He abused his power and misused patient information to push a political agenda against abortion.â€
Missouri officials apparently used patientsâ€™ period data to investigate failed abortions
The news of the spreadsheet is just the latest in a conflict between the clinic and state regulators that Planned Parenthood says has been going on since Williams took office in 2017. The health department director had previously not said much publicly about his position on abortion but at the hearings this week, he said he is â€œpro-life,â€ the Star reported on Tuesday.
One of the clinicâ€™s doctors told Vox that after Williams became director, health department officials said they had â€œreinterpretedâ€ state regulations and found the clinic out of compliance.
In particular, the department said that an audit of the clinic this March had found â€œdeficient practicesâ€ and since then officials have declined to renew the clinicâ€™s license to perform abortions. The hearing this week will help determine whether that license can be renewed or whether the clinic will have to stop performing abortions. If so, it would make Missouri the first state without an abortion clinic since Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing Americansâ€™ right to the procedure.
The health department has not been clear about what â€œdeficient practicesâ€ they found but the hearing on Tuesday offered some clues. Williams testified that the state found evidence of a failed abortion for which a required complication report was not filed with the state and decided to launch an investigation into other possible abortions after which a patient remained pregnant, the Star reported.
As part of that investigation, state officials made a spreadsheet including the dates of abortion procedures and the gestational ages of fetuses. The spreadsheet also included the dates of the last menstrual period of the patients, though not the patientsâ€™ names.
The goal appears to have been to use the data about periods to determine which patients, if any, were still pregnant when they went to follow-up appointments, indicating that the first abortion had not been successful. The investigators eventually found four such cases. This finding is what caused the health department to withhold the clinicâ€™s license, according to the Star.
On Wednesday, the health department issued a statement to media disputing reporting by the Star and other publications that Williams himself had sought to track patientsâ€™ periods.
â€œAs part of our initial inspection, a concern came up that DHSS may not be receiving complication reports for all failed surgical abortions, as required by law,â€ the statement read. â€œWithout a directive from Dr. Randall Williams, regulators devised a means to efficiently investigate that concern using legally-obtained information which was required by law and which Planned Parenthood routinely submits.â€
However, as the Star reports, the spreadsheet, obtained by Planned Parenthood through legal discovery, was titled â€œDirectorâ€™s Request.â€
The statement goes on to explain that regulators looked at data on patients who had multiple abortions in the same year, and then â€œthe data was further narrowed to exclude multiple abortions.â€ Presumably, this is where information on patientsâ€™ last menstrual period came in â€” the statement notes that clinics are required to report such data to the state.
However, the health department says that â€œDr. Williams did not possess a spreadsheet of patient information, and although there was no wrong-doing by regulators, the first time he saw the spreadsheet was at the time of his deposition on Oct. 17.â€
Whatever the case, the fact that Missouri state officials were analyzing patientsâ€™ period data has inspired shock and concern among many. â€œState law requires the health department director to be â€˜of recognized character and integrity,â€™â€ Democratic state Rep. Crystal Quade told the Star in a statement. â€œThis unsettling behavior calls into question whether Doctor Williams meets that high standard.â€
Meanwhile, Yamelsie Rodriguez, president of Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, called the news of the spreadsheet â€œdeeply disturbingâ€ in a statement to media. â€œMissouriâ€™s top health official, Randall Williams, scrutinized menstrual cycles of women in this state in order to end abortion access,â€ she said.
The department has long publicly maintained that its investigations of the clinic have been about patient health and safety, and abortion opponents send a similar message.
â€œState officials trying to protect womenâ€™s health have a difficult job because all that we know about negative outcomes of abortion in general or from any specific location are what they choose to tell us,â€ Kristan Hawkins, president of the group Students for Life, told Vox in a statement. She called for a â€œnational abortion reporting lawâ€ to make more data on abortions available.
Others, however, question why state officials would need to keep data on patientsâ€™ menstrual periods.
â€œI donâ€™t know why people would be keeping track of these things other than trying to use public health or regulation to try to manage peopleâ€™s bodies,â€ Brandi said.
Failed abortions are very rare. But theyâ€™ve become a political talking point.
The Missouri health department isnâ€™t the only government office to keep data on patientsâ€™ periods in recent years. Officials from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is charged with caring for unaccompanied, undocumented minor immigrants, kept a spreadsheet of data on pregnant minors, including, in some cases, the dates of their last menstrual periods, according to documents obtained by the progressive group American Bridge. The spreadsheet, reproductive health and immigrantsâ€™ rights advocates say, was part of a larger effort to block these minors from getting abortions.
Scott Lloyd, the former director of ORR, has denied that the office tracked minorsâ€™ periods and said the entries on menstruation on the spreadsheet â€œappear to be early attempts by field staff at dating the gestational age of unborn children in our care.â€
But Rodriguez said in her statement that the Missouri health department spreadsheet â€œshadows the Trump administrationâ€™s history of tracking the periods of refugee girls under the governmentâ€™s care.â€
Missouri officials also arenâ€™t the first to express concern over â€œfailedâ€ abortions. After Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam made confusing comments about an abortion bill in his state earlier this year, President Trump began making the claim that abortion doctors were executing infants after birth. â€œThey wrap the baby beautifully, and then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby,â€ he said at a rally in April.
And in the Senate, Republicans held a vote in February on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would require doctors to provide the same care to a baby born alive after a failed attempt at an abortion that they would provide to any child of the same gestational age. If they failed to comply, they could face five years in prison.
The bill didnâ€™t pass, but its sponsors and other abortion opponents around the country have argued that such laws are necessary to protect babies who â€œare left to dieâ€ after failed abortions.
Others, however, point out that it is already illegal to kill a baby after birth and no abortion law allows that practice. Moreover, doctors say that circumstances in which a living baby is born after a failed attempt at abortion are vanishingly rare.
In general, abortion is very effective, resulting in the end of a pregnancy in 99 percent of cases involving surgical abortion and 95 to 99 percent of cases involving medication, Brandi said. â€œIâ€™m very happy to be able to provide this care that I know works well for the vast majority of patients.â€
Even in cases where the procedure fails, though, itâ€™s extremely unlikely for a baby to be born alive. Most abortions are done in the first trimester of pregnancy, when a fetus cannot survive outside the womb, and only about 1 percent are performed after 20 weeksâ€™ gestation. In the case of Missouri, the health departmentâ€™s concern appears to be not babies born alive but patients who remained pregnant after an abortion procedure. In that case, patients can get a second procedure to make sure the pregnancy is terminated.
â€œWhen Iâ€™m talking to my patients,â€ Brandi said, â€œI do tell them that there is a chanceâ€ that the procedure may not work. She always schedules a follow-up appointment â€œto make sure that everything is going well with them,â€ she said.
And for Brandi, as a doctor who provides abortions, the narrative around failed abortions in Missouri and elsewhere has been â€œheartbreakingâ€ to read, she said.
â€œPeople are trying to use politics to get their message across in a way that makes it seem like doctors who are providing this care, and other medical professions as well, are not doing their job,â€ she said. In reality, â€œWe care incredibly about our patients and want to make sure that the care that we provide is the safest possible and based on medical evidence and not politics.â€"
"Puerto Rican leaders are pushing for statehood again.
Rep. Jenniffer GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n, Puerto Ricoâ€™s sole non-voting member of Congress, introduced a bill Tuesday that would create a path for the US territory to become the 51st state.
The bipartisan Puerto Rican Statehood Admission Act would fund a ballot referendum in Puerto Rico in November 2020, asking voters on the island if they want statehood or not. Itâ€™s a slight variation of previous ballot measures that went nowhere. If the bill passes, it would mark the third time Puerto Ricans have voted on the statehood issue since 2012.
â€œ[The bill] places us on the path towards the political equality we deserve,â€ GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n said on Twitter Tuesday.
Thereâ€™s just one major problem: Like past measures, the result of the vote is not legally binding. So even if a majority of Puerto Ricans voted for statehood, Congress could still decide to do nothing about it. Thatâ€™s happened before. And itâ€™s not like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown any interest in admitting Puerto Rico into the union.
â€œYou just have to call a charade a charade,â€ Julio Ricardo Varela, co-host of the political podcast In the Thick, said on Twitter. His cynicism is shared by many Puerto Ricans in the US who closely follow the islandâ€™s politics.
Puerto Rican leaders are pushing forward anyway. With Democrats in control of the House, thereâ€™s a better chance to pass a statehood bill through the chamber. The island â€” plagued by the devastation of Hurricane Maria and still struggling to rebuild â€” has been a US territory since 1898, but has long suffered from widespread American indifference toward, or ignorance of, Puerto Ricoâ€™s political status.
Even though all Puerto Ricans are US citizens, the 3.4 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico have fewer constitutional rights than anyone living in the 50 states. Americans on the island canâ€™t vote for president in the general election or elect a voting member of Congress, making it easy for congressional leaders to ignore them.
The question of whether or not Puerto Rico should become a state has been the most divisive issue on the island for decades. But Puerto Ricoâ€™s financial crisis, which began in 2006, began to revive support for statehood, and the brutal aftermath of Hurricane Maria has made the matter even more urgent to resolve. The remaining question is whether the White House and Republicans in Congress will uphold Americaâ€™s longstanding promise to let Puerto Ricans decide if they want statehood. The chances seem slim.
Congress has avoided the issue as much as possible
The biggest obstacle for Puerto Rico is that there is no official process for a US territory to become a US state. Political leaders on the island have been asking for a clear path to statehood since the 1960s.
Past presidents have supported statehood for Puerto Rico, if thatâ€™s what the majority of Puerto Ricans wanted. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did. So did Trump, during his presidential campaign. Support for statehood was even enshrined in the Republican Party platform.
Puerto Ricoâ€™s congressional delegates have introduced multiple (failed) bills over the years, which granted Puerto Rico statehood based on the outcome of a popular vote on the island. But there has never been a clear consensus in Puerto Rico on the issue.
In 2016, the pro-statehood political party won control over the islandâ€™s legislature, the governorâ€™s mansion, and the islandâ€™s sole (non-voting) congressional seat. Since then, Puerto Rican leaders have tried various strategies to get lawmakers in Washington to address the issue. Lawmakers have mostly ignored them.
Congress asked Puerto Rico to vote on the statehood issue. It did.
In June 2017, after the pro-statehood party swept into power, Puerto Ricans on the island voted to join the United States as the 51st state. It was the fifth time the island has held a referendum on whether to join the republic. The vast majority voted in favor of statehood: 97 percent â€” the largest number yet.
The problem is that fewer than a quarter of registered voters turned out to the polls. That was mostly the result of a boycott from the anti-statehood political groups, who were upset with the wording of the referendum.
Then-Gov. Ricardo RossellÃ³ was fulfilling his campaign promise to push forward with the statehood process, as part of the pro-statehood party. The second main political party in Puerto Rico is the Popular Democratic Party, which wants to remain a commonwealth. A smaller number of Puerto Ricans want full independence.
The islandâ€™s current economic crisis, which began around 2008, has renewed the effort to gain statehood and helped get RossellÃ³ into office. More federal money would flow to Puerto Rico if it were a state, though it would also increase federal taxes on the people who live there.
After the 2016 election, Jenniffer GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n introduced two House bills that would allow Puerto Rico to become the 51st American state â€” one before Hurricane Maria hit, and the in the summer of 2018.
When GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n introduced a statehood bill in June 2018, she got a group of 53 Republicans and Democrats to co-sponsor it â€” the most yet. The Puerto Rico Admission Act would have created a task force to immediately start the process of transitioning Puerto Rico into a US state, which would have happened by January 1, 2021.
â€œNow is the time,â€ GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n said in a statement, when she introduced the bill in Congress. â€œThe catastrophe left behind by Hurricanes Irma and MarÃ­a unmasked the reality of the unequal treatment of the American living in Puerto Rico.â€
The bill never made it to the House floor for a vote.
Puerto Rican identity is deeply rooted in the question of statehood
The status of Puerto Rico has been the main political issue on the island since the United States annexed it in 1898 at the end of the Spanish-American War. Over the years, Congress has ceded small amounts of autonomy to Puerto Rico, which now operates as a quasi-state. It has an independent elected local government, but without all the power and benefits of being a state â€” including a lack of real representation in Congress.
Puerto Ricans are American citizens, but they donâ€™t pay federal income taxes if they live on the island. They do pay payroll taxes to fund Social Security and Medicare. The island gets limited funding for Medicaid and food stamps. It doesnâ€™t have representation in the Electoral College, so Puerto Ricans canâ€™t vote for president unless they live in the United States.
Over the past 50 years, Washington lawmakers have introduced more than 130 bills to resolve Puerto Ricoâ€™s political status, and none have gone anywhere. The closest Puerto Rico got to changing its status was in 1990, when the House approved a bill that would let Puerto Ricans decide once and for all whether they wanted to become a state. The bill never made it through the Senate.
Itâ€™s obvious why Republicans might not want Puerto Rico to join the union. Puerto Ricans living on the US mainland vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, so adding new seats in the Senate and House could weaken Republican power. Yet the Republican Party has always paid lip service to the idea.
â€œPersonally, I strongly favor statehood,â€ President George H.W. Bush said in his first State of the Union address in 1989. â€œBut I urge the Congress to take the necessary steps to allow the people to decide in a referendum.
That didnâ€™t happen.
Hurricane survivors favor statehood
While there has never been a true consensus on the issue, statehood appears to be the most popular option in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.
Hurricane survivors who live on the island agree that the federal government would have responded differently to the disaster if Puerto Rico were a US state, according to a 2018 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Washington Post.
The survey also shows that hurricane survivors who live in Puerto Rico favor statehood over any alternative. About 48 percent want Puerto Rico to become a state, 26 percent would rather remain a US territory, and 10 percent want full independence. About 16 percent were unsure or declined to answer. The survey included responses from about 1,500 households polled between July and August 2018.
The survey reflects a slight shift in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico, which is something GonzÃ¡lez-ColÃ³n and her pro-statehood allies in Congress are hoping to capitalize on. By giving voters a simple â€œyes or noâ€ option to answer whether they want Puerto Rico to become a state, they are hoping to avoid boycotts that would lead some voters to skip the question.
But even if the referendum shows overwhelming support for Puerto Rico, itâ€™s unclear what comes after that. Just getting enough support for a federally funded ballot measure could be a challenge. Right now, the bill only has 46 co-sponsors in the House â€” far from a majority.

"The first official Game of Thrones spinoff series is finally happening: House of the Dragon, a story exploring the rise of the Targaryen dynasty and set 300 years before the events of Thrones, will receive an initial 10-episode run at HBO. The prequel, which doesnâ€™t have a premiere date, is the first of HBOâ€™s original five pitched spinoffs to make it through to a confirmed series order.
Colony co-creator Ryan Condal created the series with author George R.R. Martin, upon whose Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series the Game of Thrones universe is based. Popular Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik, who directed major battle sequences in essential episodes like â€œHardhomeâ€ and â€œBattle of the Bastards,â€ will direct multiple episodes, including the pilot, and will serve as co-showrunner along with Condal.
The network announced the new series at an investor event for the upcoming streaming platform HBO Max on Tuesday evening, just hours after reports surfaced that HBO had killed development of a different Game of Thrones prequel series. According to a May blog post from Martin, other Game of Thrones TV spinoffs may still be in the works, but the fates of the other series are currently unclear.
That leaves House of the Dragon as Game of Thronesâ€™ fans best chance, at least for now, at seeing more stories from Westeros come to life.
House of the Dragon will follow established Westeros history
House of the Dragon is based on events chronicled in Martinâ€™s historical Westeros companion book Fire and Blood, according to Martinâ€™s post in May. The series, like the book, will largely concern the events that led to the Targaryenâ€™s long reign over Westeros. The timeline sets the story as beginning 300 years prior to the events of Game of Thrones, which means the series will follow the years of Aegon I Targaryenâ€™s steady campaign to conquer all of Westeros, a time that became known as Aegonâ€™s Conquest.
Rumors about the series from earlier this year have also suggested that the storyline could encompass a major historical event that eventually led up to Aegonâ€™s Conquest â€” the â€œDoom of Valyria,â€ a cataclysmic event similar to the destruction of Pompei in our world. Valyria was once the ruling country of Essos, Westerosâ€™s neighbor to the East. But during the Doom, the capital city of Old Valyria was destroyed in a single day by a massive volcanic eruption, followed by subsequent earthquakes that completed the devastation, altered the geography of the continent, and brought about the extinction of most of the regionâ€™s dragons.
In the middle of the destruction, House Targaryen emerged intact â€” and, crucially, saved most of its dragons, giving the clan unexpected power. The series will most likely deal with the political intrigues and clashes with other clans that follow the Targaryenâ€™s rise to prominence.
If House of the Dragon follows Fire and Blood in its entirety, it will also invoke the â€œDance of the Dragons,â€ a fierce dispute over succession similar to the English Wars of the Roses, which divided the Targaryens and ultimately split the country into civil war.
The major advantage to following this storyline is that we already know how it ends â€” at least in Martinâ€™s version.
Weâ€™ll update this article with additional information about the series as we learn more."
"HBO Max is coming in May 2020. Itâ€™s going to cost $14.99 per month, and if youâ€™re an HBO Now subscriber who subscribes directly through HBO or an AT&T cable provider (UVerse or DirecTV), you will be upgraded to HBO Max automatically, at no additional cost.
At least thatâ€™s what I think is going to happen. Thereâ€™s still a lot of obfuscation surrounding who will be getting what when HBO Max launches. But we do know that it will be $14.99 per month, that it will feature a large library of titles from across the WarnerMedia universe, and that it will be the only place where you can stream things like Friends or the films of Studio Ghibli.
At a presentation for investors in Burbank, California, on Tuesday, October 29, WarnerMedia unveiled its shiny new toy, officially entering the ongoing streaming wars by directly pushing back against its chief competitors, notably Disney+ and Netflix. In the extremely controlled screenshots and snippets that Warnerâ€™s team showed off, the thing sure seemed impressive.
A proposed feature that will let two users on the same account combine their viewing preferences to receive tailored recommendations â€” ideal for a couple watching together or a parent and child looking for something theyâ€™ll both enjoy â€” seems like a cool idea if the company can get it to work. And as a fan of the late, lamented FilmStruck streaming service (partly reborn as the Criterion Channel), I love that HBO Max will feature a curated list of classic film titles, refreshed each month by the folks at Turner Classic Movies; itâ€™s not quite FilmStruck, but close enough.
But what I found most interesting about the presentation is what it revealed about how HBO Max is using its incredibly tenuous ties to the HBO brand name. Sure, itâ€™s largely built atop the existing HBO Now infrastructure, but it seems to be targeting one of its biggest competitors by attempting to out-Netflix Netflix. And crucially, it has one big advantage that Netflix doesnâ€™t have: a ready-made distribution network.
HBO Max is coming straight for Netflix
Friends was hugely important to Netflix. But it will only be available on HBO Max soon. Warner Bros. Television
Netflix sees itself as a service for all people, a sort of new version of the old broadcast TV networks, but instead of creating programs designed to draw the largest audience possible, it creates an entire service designed to do just that. Whether youâ€™re 6 or 60, the idea is that Netflix will offer multiple programs that appeal to you.
But Netflix also relies heavily on programming it has licensed from other studios, shows like Friends that are now leaving for the streaming services being launched by their parent studios. (The way these shifts are effectively creating giant walled gardens of mass pop culture is something I find troubling in the abstract, but thatâ€™s neither here nor there for the purposes of this article. I just want to note somewhere that itâ€™s kind of messed up that only a very specific subset of people might be able to conveniently stream Friends in a couple of years.) And the studios that originally licensed their content to Netflix are increasingly identifying new ways to take on the streaming king.

Netflixâ€™s upcoming content crisis, in one chart
Of particular interest are the respective approaches taken by Disney, with its new Disney+ service, and by WarnerMedia, with HBO Max. Disney+ is a targeted streaming service; itâ€™s going to be programming big, mass-market original series from the Marvel and Star Wars universes, but itâ€™s also going to ensure those series are suitable for family audiences. Disney+, in other words, sees a weakness in Netflix â€” creating a programming lineup that appeals to families with kids â€” that is simultaneously a strength of its brand. Disney equals family audiences; ergo, Disney+ does too.
Disneyâ€™s strategy is not quite an end-around that aims to cordon off an entire segment of the market from Netflix â€” which, after all, still programs plenty of family-friendly and kid-centric content. But with its price ($6.99 per month, about half of what it costs to subscribe to Netflix) and its programming strategy, itâ€™s clear that Disney is hyper-focused on this very specific audience. And if you want stuff thatâ€™s more geared toward adults and older teens in your house, well, the bundle that combines Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ costs the same as a Netflix subscription and includes the massive Hulu TV library and sports programming, something Netflix doesnâ€™t offer.
HBO Max, however, is basically just trying to outdo Netflix, without any specific audience in mind. Thereâ€™s no family tier. Thereâ€™s no premium-content-only tier thatâ€™s cheaper (you can still get HBO Now for $14.99 per month, but why would you when it has fewer things to watch?). Thereâ€™s just HBO Max. And it will probably confuse people for a while â€” since itâ€™s not HBO but also not not HBO â€” though it will likely wear down most objections in time. The idea, I think, is that if Netflix loses its popular library content (like Friends, one of the biggest shows in its catalog), then it will start to wither. And the competitors that end up with that popular library content (like HBO Max) will be able to sweep in and convince consumers that a Netflix subscription just isnâ€™t worth the money anymore.
The story of TV in the 2020s may ultimately revolve around telecoms and net neutrality
The HBO Max approach makes sense in theory, but its corporate parentage is what really explains why itâ€™s doing what itâ€™s doing. WarnerMedia is owned by AT&T, and while AT&T might not be the largest internet service provider in the US, it is the second largest American telecom (after Verizon). And it owns both the UVerse and DirecTV cable providers, which means it has a built-in customer base for the HBO Max product. If youâ€™re already an HBO subscriber on UVerse or DirecTV, your subscription will eventually be converted to an HBO Max subscription, and both cable providers will offer bundles featuring HBO Max.
Disney+ and Netflix arenâ€™t part of companies that own telecoms; they depend on the companies that do own telecoms to provide their means of distribution. And if net-neutrality rules are ultimately struck down in court â€” this would allow your internet service provider to charge a higher price for certain kinds of content â€” then bandwidth-hungry streaming content will suddenly become incredibly expensive.
Thatâ€™s no problem if youâ€™re an ISP (like, say, AT&T-owned UVerse) â€” you can offer faster, cheaper access to your own streaming service (like HBO Max) in an attempt to lure subscribers. But Disney+ and Netflix arenâ€™t affiliated with an ISP, so in a post-net-neutrality world, they may end up scrabbling to cut deals with ISPs to keep their subscription costs relatively low.
As a result, the big TV story of the 2020s might turn out to be distribution or the idea that whoever controls the airwaves controls the programming. The current race to lock up all the best movies and TV shows via exclusive deals on various services has created an expectation that the story will be about content, but the biggest shows are largely already spoken for. (HBO Max, for instance, recently closed a deal for South Parkâ€™s entire run.) The question of how you might watch that stuff without paying an arm and a leg, however â€” thatâ€™s still very much up in the air.
And thatâ€™s why I keep looking to the still-waiting-in-the-wings Peacock, from NBCUniversal and its parent company Comcast. (Disclosure: NBCUniversal invested in Vox Media, which owns Vox, in 2015.) So far, Peacock hasnâ€™t generated nearly as much buzz as Disney+ or HBO Max. But it is owned by a company that boasts a massive distribution reach in its 25 million-plus internet subscribers. Peacock, if automatically available to all of those subscribers in a post-net-neutrality world, would be in an enviable position indeed.
Peacock launches in April 2020 â€” one month before HBO Max â€” so its looming presence remains the single biggest puzzle piece we canâ€™t yet account for in the streaming wars. By the time HBO Max launches, its strategy of running straight at Netflix might seem refreshing, or it might seem foolhardy. Weâ€™ll just have to wait and see."
"John Dillingerâ€™s body â€” or that of his unlucky lookalike â€” may soon be unearthed.
Relatives of the infamous Midwestern gangster, who robbed banks and police stations, stole cars, and repeatedly escaped prison, are embroiled in a legal battle to open his casket, which they believe stores the body of an imposter. Dillingerâ€™s niece and nephew say they have evidence that his eye color and fingerprints differ from those of the body inside the grave â€” a notion the FBI, whose agents gunned down the fearsome leader of the Dillinger Gang in 1934, labeled a â€œconspiracy theory.â€
Dillinger isnâ€™t the only historical figure with one foot out of the grave. This month, a Spanish court approved a plan to exhume the remains of former dictator Francisco Franco from a public monument and rebury them in a private cemetery. And members of Dublinâ€™s city council are hatching a plot to dig up and repatriate James Joyceâ€™s remains from Zurich, where the Irish author died.
The very idea of disturbing the dead has been a source of angst and spooky entertainment for much of recorded history. True believers say the â€œcurse of the pharaohsâ€ is responsible for the premature deaths of several members of the team that cracked open King Tutâ€™s tomb. In Mary Shelleyâ€™s classic horror novel Frankenstein, Dr. Frankensteinâ€™s troubles begin when he imbues an assortment of stolen body parts with life. And zombies serve as metaphors for infection, racism, and climate change in books, movies, and TV. Dillingerâ€™s relatives wanted to film the exhumation as part of a macabre History Channel documentary, which has since been scrapped. (The exhumation, however, is plowing ahead; itâ€™s slated for New Yearâ€™s Eve.)
But digging up bones remains taboo, in part because many religions forbid the practice lest it disturb the afterlife. Certain Native American tribes believe moving a personâ€™s remains can unsettle their spirit. Rabbis rarely approve the disinterment of Jews, with rare exceptions for things like reburial in Israel. Islam discourages opening, handling, or reusing graves until there are no traces of the original corpse left. And many Christians believe if someoneâ€™s body is disturbed or destroyed, they cannot be resurrected. (Even so, the Catholic Church announced it would â€œnot oppose the exhumation of Franco.â€)
Exhumations, however, continue across the globe. While no one knows how many are carried out globally each year, forensic experts extract DNA from human remains for criminal investigations, genealogical research, and identification of victims of war; and government agencies can relocate entire cemeteries to make space for a new skyscraper, bigger airports, or hydroelectric dams. And, as in the case of Jimi Hendrix, whose family members moved his remains from a humble grave to a grand memorial in 2002, the living move their dead to new plots, new cemeteries, even new cities.
But what do you find inside?
Corpses typically pass through five stages of decomposition: fresh, when cells begin to burst; bloat, when pent-up gases cause the body to expand and turn from flesh-colored to green to black; active decomposition, in which tissues turn to liquid and maggots eat what they can; advanced decomposition, where hardier bugs tackle tendons; and ultimately, skeletal decay, where bones begin to disintegrate. Even embalming â€” injecting a corpse with preservatives like formaldehyde â€”â€œis only a temporary deterrent,â€ says George Kelder, executive director of the New Jersey State Funeral Directors Association.
Disinterments typically start the same way â€” a backhoe quickly clears the topsoil â€” but each exhumation is unique, depending on the condition of the corpse. â€œYou just donâ€™t know what youâ€™re going to see until youâ€™re there,â€ says Rob Goff, executive director of the Washington State Funeral Directors Association. Cold weather can limit the growth of hungry bacteria. Fatty tissue can form â€œgrave wax,â€ which mummifies the body in a soapy substance. And, in rare cases, an embalmed body may look similar to the day it was buried, even if decades have passed.
Thatâ€™s where hardware comes in. Eco-friendly caskets, like those made from bamboo or cardboard, disintegrate quickly. Wooden caskets, from mahogany to pine, last a bit longer but still erode. In those cases, the disinterment crew will have to collect any human remains and place them in a new, smaller vessel for reburial. But if someone was buried in a metal casket â€” typically steel, copper, or bronze â€” they may be able to move the box directly from one grave to another.
Caskets are rarely placed directly in the ground. Grave liners prevent the earth from collapsing in on the remains, but theyâ€™re not waterproof and offer little protection from the elements. Concrete vaults are pricier, but they can prevent soil, water, and other invaders from seeping in. Concrete vaults also make exhumations easier because the crew can pull the entire vault out of the earth and easily plop it elsewhere. In the event of an exhumation, â€œmost funeral directors are crossing their fingers the body is in a concrete vault,â€ Kelder says.
But in some cases, any evidence of a body has disappeared entirely. â€œI have talked to people who have been involved in disinterments of older cemeteries,â€ says Tanya Marsh, a law professor at Wake Forest University specializing in funeral and cemetery law. â€œThereâ€™s no intact casket, thereâ€™s no intact skeleton. They can find the casket handles because theyâ€™re metal. Itâ€™s just discolored soil.â€ Still, many consider that discolored dirt to be human remains. Since the advent of Roman law, Marsh says, â€œreal estate that contains human remains is never just soil again.â€ So funeral directors will box up the sand and clay and re-inter it as planned.
â€œEach of those remains could fit in a shoebox,â€ Kelder says of these older burials. â€œWe show up with a dignified wooden vessel the size of a shoebox.â€
This inherent unpredictability makes exhumation an emotional process. â€œThe professionals I work with will do it somewhat secretly,â€ Goff says. â€œThatâ€™s a bad word to use, but theyâ€™ll have a lot of vehicles â€” or potentially tents â€” set up because cemeteries are a public place, and the last thing a funeral professional wants to do is put anyone in an uncomfortable position.â€ The same is true for family members. Legally, they can attend a disinterment, but funeral directors often advise them against it.
Working under the cover of darkness contributes to exhumationâ€™s hair-raising reputation. The sordid history of grave robbing doesnâ€™t help, either. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some medical students moonlighted as â€œbody snatchers,â€ digging up freshly buried corpses for anatomy labs. Even today, the FBI has agents tracking down Americans who loot native burial grounds.
But legal disinterment is carefully controlled to ensure respect for human remains. In the United States, when someone is buried, courts presume the person wanted to stay buried unless he or she specified otherwise. Most states require special permits to disinter a body. This allows the court to ensure the chain of custody is transparent, and the wishes of the deceased are represented. â€œThe dead have rights,â€ Marsh says.
Thatâ€™s why Dillingerâ€™s family petitioned the Indiana State Health Department for a permit to exhume the contested corpse. Though they secured the paperwork, Crown Hill Cemetery, where Dillinger is buried, has taken the case to court. â€œWe honor the trust placed in us to protect all individuals in our care, and to protect the interests of those who cannot speak for themselves,â€ the Indianapolis cemeteryâ€™s staff wrote in a statement.
Legal battles aside, the most difficult part of the process is usually the digging. â€œ[They are] the same exact skills that you would need to inter someone that you need to disinter them,â€ says Bree Harvey, vice president of cemetery and visitor services at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Crews of up to six people can work as long as eight hours excavating a grave.
Like every other aspect of dying, it can be costly. At Mount Auburn, Harvey says disinterment fees range from $750 to $5,250, depending on the terrain, age, and style of the grave.

"Sometimes itâ€™s the tiniest spark that lights the biggest fires.
At least, thatâ€™s the case in Chile, where a 4 percent fare hike raising the price of a ride on the capitalâ€™s metro system by 30 pesos, or about $0.04, ignited mass protests on October 18 that have yet to subside.
That day, students in Santiago called for widespread fare evasion on social media using the hashtag #EvasionMasiva. The turnstile-hopping rapidly devolved into larger demonstrations and chaos, with looting in supermarkets, rioting in the streets, and the torching of 22 metro stations.

Soon after midnight, Chileâ€™s center-right president, SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, called for a state of emergency, sending military out onto the streets and installing a curfew in cities across the nation for the first time since the end of the brutal dictatorship of the 1970s and â€™80s.
Since then, escalating protests have left 19 dead, according to figures from the Ministry of Interior and Public Security. Efforts by the government to quell the unrest â€” including shuffling the presidentâ€™s cabinet â€” have failed spectacularly. Demonstrations have grown in size to encompass a raft of issues from dismal pensions to poor public services.
Few foreign experts saw this coming. After all, Chile had transformed into one of Latin Americaâ€™s safest and most stable economies. So how did it happen?
A wealthy success story â€” with massive inequality
Chile has â€” at least from afar â€” been heralded as a regional success story for its solid governance and investor-friendly environment. Its free-market model has driven down poverty from 31 percent in 2000 to 6.4 percent in 2017, according to the World Bank, and made the copper-rich Andean nation the highest-ranked country in Latin America on the United Nations Human Development Index.
Scratch beneath the surface, however, and you find a murkier picture. A recent study by Santiago-based think tank FundaciÃ³n SOL shows that 50 percent of Chilean workers earn less than 400,000 pesos per month (roughly $550), making a small change to public transportation costs a plausible breaking point.

Meanwhile, a UN report from 2017 found that the richest 1 percent of the population earns 33 percent of the nationâ€™s wealth, making Chile the most unequal member of the OECD (an intergovernmental economic organization of largely developed nations).
Julio Pinto, a professor at the University of Santiago who studies social movements, notes that the fruits of Chileâ€™s growth over the past three decades (on the back of the copper boom) have been unevenly distributed.
â€œThe image Chile projects internationally is that of a country that has grown, that has developed, that is in many senses a wealthy country,â€ Pinto says, â€œbut this image is held up on very flimsy pillars.â€

Pinto points to smaller protest movements that have taken place in the country in recent years (seeking better education standards and a fairer pension system) as signals that things have not been going well for the everyday Chilean.
â€œWhatâ€™s really new this time around is that all of these tensions flared up together in an explosion that covered the entire country and almost every social sector with a unison that hasnâ€™t happened before,â€ Pinto says.
â€œWe have gone to the streets to ask for our dignityâ€
Organized crime groups taking advantage of the unrest to loot and break into property dominated headlines in the first week of protests. However, the narrative changed last Friday when more than 1 million Chileans gathered in and around Santiagoâ€™s Plaza Italia for a peaceful demonstration.
Citizens of all social strata banged pots and pans, played music, and carried signs announcing â€œChile despertÃ³â€ (Chile woke up). It was the biggest gathering of any kind in Chilean history, drawing more than 5 percent of the nationâ€™s population.
More than 100,000 protesters joined a symbolic march Sunday along the coast from the beachfront city of ViÃ±a del Mar to the Congress building in neighboring Valparaiso. Similar protests took place across the country Monday and more demonstrations have been called for every day this week.

The movement is growing, but its ultimate goals remain difficult to pin down. Unlike previous demonstrations in Chile, there are no clear leaders vocalizing unified demands. (While fractured opposition political parties have expressed support for the protests, they have not led them.)
But a shared theme among the protesters I spoke to is the restoration of social rights and a systematic change to address rising costs of living and stagnant wages.
â€œThis protest is not about 30 pesos, but 30 years,â€ says Stephanie DÃ­az, a 28-year-old sports teacher from the working-class Quinta Normal neighborhood in Santiago. â€œItâ€™s 30 years since the return to democracy, but we have preserved a constitution made under the dictatorship.â€
Chileâ€™s constitution, which was written into law during the military rule of Augusto Pinochet in 1980, calls for a highly privatized economy. Even water is a privately traded commodity.
In order to keep up with the rising costs of private-sector services, not to mention some of the highest university tuitions in the world, nearly half of Chileâ€™s 9 million-strong workforce is now in debt, according to a report from Chileâ€™s ComisiÃ³n para el Mercado Financiero, a regulator and supervisor of the Chilean financial market.
DÃ­az says she is protesting so that her elders can have a living pension and workers can enjoy better public infrastructure. She wants the everyday needs of citizens to carry more weight in the decisions made by the ruling class.
â€œWe have gone to the streets to ask for our dignity,â€ DÃ­az says, â€œand this will not stop until we get it.â€
A government crackdown revives old ghosts of brutal military rule
When Santiago first erupted into chaos on October 18, a (now confirmed) image circulated on social media showing President PiÃ±era dining at an upmarket pizzeria. For his opponents, it was all the confirmation they needed that the billionaire businessman was completely out of touch with the Chilean reality.
PiÃ±era returned to power last year for a second non-consecutive term with the promise of reviving a slowing economy. And he took a hard-handed approach in the early days of the unrest, saying that Chile was â€œat war with a powerful, implacable enemy.â€ He later apologized and offered a more conciliatory tone, but his impulse decision to send some 20,000 troops out onto the streets had already enraged a large swath of the Chilean population.
Older generations are still grappling with the ghosts of military rule. Many interviewed on local TV news felt they were forced to relive the pain of some of the darkest days in Chileâ€™s history.
Pinochetâ€™s regime left more than 3,000 dead or missing, with tens of thousands more tortured and imprisoned. Chileâ€™s latest unrest has left more than 3,535 people detained, according to Chileâ€™s national institute for human rights, with many more seriously injured or blinded by the pellet guns used (alongside tear gas) to disperse crowds.
The current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is Chileâ€™s ex-president, Michelle Bachelet, a left-leaning politician who was herself tortured during the dictatorship. On Monday, she sent a team of human rights officers to Chile to investigate allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the military.

Ahead of their arrival, PiÃ±era lifted the state of emergency Sunday after gradually removing curfews across the country. Over the past week, he has promised marginally higher taxes on the rich, a boost to the minimum wage, a 20 percent increase in the lowest pensions, and more reasonable costs for medicine.
All of this â€” in addition to the partial reopening of six metro lines and most grocery stores in the capital â€” has restored a semblance of normalcy. But opponents call the new â€œsocial pactâ€ proposed by PiÃ±era a cosmetic change that does little to solve underlying problems. Some 80 percent of Chileans surveyed by Chilean pollster Cadem found the proposed reforms inadequate in a poll published Sunday in the local newspaper La Tercera.
The government has yet to come up with an effective response to the growing list of economic and political demands, including PiÃ±eraâ€™s own resignation. The Cadem poll found that the presidentâ€™s approval rating had plunged to a historic low of just 14 percent, with posters and graffiti scrawled across the capital demanding his resignation.

Pressure is mounting to quell the unrest before Chile welcomes a number of world leaders, President Donald Trump among them, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in mid-November. Even more notables â€” including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg â€” are expected to arrive in Santiago in December for COP 25, the UN Climate Change Conference.
The clock is ticking, but the solutions remain elusive.

"Presidential candidates are going all out to win over working-class Americans as they prepare for the fifth Democratic debate.
Most of the Democratic frontrunners are also releasing detailed policy platforms that promise workers everything theyâ€™ve ever wanted. Paid parental leave â€” yes. A $15 minimum wage â€” check. Paid sick days â€” done.
And for the first time, most candidates are really paying attention to working women and the challenges they face in the workplace, such as lower pay and few accommodations for pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Sure, not every candidate is promising workers major reform. Some candidates are more interested in incremental changes. But even so, the 2020 Democratic primary election is shaping up to provide the most ambitious blueprint to overhaul US labor laws. And with public frustration toward billionaires and CEOs mounting, it seems like a smart campaign strategy.
â€œThis is our moment to dream big,â€ Elizabeth Warren said during her campaign announcement event in Lawrence, Massachusetts, a location she picked because of its role as the birthplace of the US labor movement.
Reading the labor platforms for each of the 12 candidates who participated in the fourth Democratic primary debate this month, two groups emerged: the labor reformers and the labor supporters. The frontrunners fall into the first category â€” Warren, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, as well as JuliÃ¡n Castro and Beto Oâ€™Rourke, have all put out detailed proposals that would shift the balance of power from businesses to workers. Kamala Harrisâ€™s specifically focuses on teachers.
Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang are in the second group; they seem to see themselves more as allies to workers and labor unions, not bringing sweeping change. Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, meanwhile, donâ€™t have much of a plan to offer workers at all.
Pro-worker legislation that 2020 candidates support
Most of the reformers â€” Cory Booker, Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders Castro, and Warren â€”explicitly support the following legislation (additional candidates who support these are noted in parentheses), some of which have already passed the House of Representatives.
The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which would ban â€œright to workâ€ laws that allow employees to opt out of paying union fees in unionized workplaces, even though they get the benefits of collective bargaining. (Biden, Oâ€™Rourke, and Klobuchar support this too.)
The Schedules That Work Act, which guarantees predictable schedules for workers, or extra pay if they have to work irregular schedules.
The Paycheck Fairness Act, which would bar employers from using an employeeâ€™s salary history to determine wages, ensure that workers have the right to discuss wages without retaliation, and require employers to justify any pay discrepancies. (Biden, Oâ€™Rourke and Klobuchar support this too.)
The Family Act, which guarantees up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to workers, funded through a payroll tax on businesses and employees. (Klobuchar supports this too)
The Healthy Families Act, which would require most businesses to provide full-time workers with at least seven days of paid sick leave. (Oâ€™Rourke and Klobuchar support this too.)
The Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act would essentially amend federal labor laws to include domestic workers. But it would also extend new benefits to them, such as guaranteed paid time off, privacy protection, and a written employment contract. (Biden and Klobuchar support this too)
The Raise the Wage Act, which gradually raises the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and indexes future increases to wage growth. It also abolishes the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers. (Oâ€™Rourke and Klobuchar support this too.)
The labor reformersâ€™ platforms
Former Vice President Joe Biden
Biden moved into the labor reformersâ€™ category after he recently released a detailed plan that would increase penalties for labor violations and hold company executives personally liable for interfering in union organizing. Employers who intentionally interfere with unionizing efforts could even face criminal charges. Thatâ€™s a huge change from the status quo. Right now, employers face zero financial and criminal penalties when they illegally try to discourage workers from forming a labor union.
Here are more highlights:
He supports a $15 federal minimum wage, but doesnâ€™t specifically endorse the Raise the Wage Act.
He wants to stiffen penalties against companies that misclassify employees as independent contractors.
Biden promises to let gig workers and other independent contractors unionize.
He wants to give public sector workers the right to unionize under federal law and endorses the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.
He suggests banning noncompete and anti-poaching clauses in employment contracts that make it hard for employees to find better jobs.
He wants to ban mandatory arbitration clauses in job contracts, which require workers to waive their right to sue their employer.
He supports closing the loophole in federal labor laws that excludes farm workers and domestic workers from getting basic labor protections.
Biden promises to create a cabinet-level working group to find ways to boost union membership, such as exploring sectoral bargaining, in which a union negotiates on behalf of workers in an entire industry.
One major difference between Bidenâ€™s latest labor plan and other candidates in this category is that Biden doesnâ€™t endorse a specific universal paid parental leave program or guaranteed paid sick days.
Sen. Cory Booker
Bookerâ€™s labor platform is thin and somewhat vague, which is an argument for placing him in the â€œlabor supportersâ€ category. But his one signature plan is big enough to shift the balance of power in favor of workers in fundamental ways â€” the Worker Dividend Act he sponsored in the Senate.
The bill would curb how companies buy back their own stocks, forcing them to give workers a cut. The Worker Dividend Act would mandate that companies buying their own shares must also pay out to their own employees a sum equal to the lesser of either the total value of the buyback or 50 percent of all profits beyond $250 million.
As Voxâ€™s Matthew Yglesias explains, the bill is â€œa critique of the overall operation of an economic system that people on the left have long argued is systematically broken and stacked against everyone but the very wealthiest Americans.â€
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Somewhat surprisingly, Buttigieg has one of the most comprehensive labor platforms, including more than just a wish list from labor unions. He wants to make sure domestic workers and farmworkers are covered by US labor laws, which closes a huge loophole that allows employers to exploit vulnerable workers. He promises paid parental leave, a $15 minimum hourly wage (indexed to wage growth), and to let Uber drivers and other gig workers unionize. Here are some other highlights:
He wants stronger, multimillion-dollar penalties for large companies that interfere with union elections.
He wants to let McDonaldâ€™s employees and other franchise workers bargain collectively with multiple employers at the same time, also known as sectoral bargaining. (Voxâ€™s Dylan Matthews explained that concept, which is common in Europe.)
He wants to establish a consistent preference in federal government contracting for unionized employers that provide workers with fair pay and benefits.
He backs the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would require businesses to make accommodations for pregnant workers.
Buttigieg also suggests a smart change to temporary visas for foreign workers. High-skilled and low-skilled workers in the US on H-1B or H-2B visas, for example, would no longer be tied to one employer under his proposal. That has been one of the biggest problems with the guest worker programs. Businesses that employ foreign workers end up with too much power over that workforce, making them more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
Former US housing secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro
Castro just released a new labor platform that focuses on the most vulnerable workers in the US economy: farm workers and domestic workers. Castro says he drew inspiration for his plan from his grandmother, Victoria, who earned a living cleaning houses, cooking and babysitting. His proposal would not only grant basic labor protections to both groups of workers, it would also create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented farm workers.
Here are other highlights:
Castro would abolish the current guest worker programs that allow businesses to temporarily import foreign workers during a labor shortage. Employers have a history of abusing these programs and exploiting workers, which Castro points out. In its place, he would create a visa program for farm workers and housekeepers to work in the United States with a path to permanent residency and citizenship.
Castro would invest in affordable housing for farm workers and create a land trust to help them buy small farms.
He wants to guarantee at least seven days of paid sick leave for all workers at large companies, by passing and building on the Healthy Families Act.
He supports at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to be used during pregnancy, new child leave, to care for a sick family member, for recovery from mental or physical illness, or for other family-related reasons.
Castro wants to ban discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity by passing and building on the Equality Act.
He wants to help close the gender pay gap by protecting workers against retaliation for discussing salaries, preventing employers from requiring salary history, and raising the standard of proof for employers to implement pay disparities by passing and building on the Paycheck Fairness Act.
He plans to require corporations to reserve board seats for workers
He wants to prohibit businesses from making employees sign non-disclosure agreements, forced arbitration, and non-compete clauses.
Castro promises to extend collective bargaining rights to government employees and would make it harder for businesses to misclassify employees as independent contractors.
Sen. Kamala Harris
Harris has focused her labor platform on working women and public schoolteachers, in particular. She supports a $15 minimum wage and wants to create stricter penalties for companies that commit wage theft.
Here are more details from her plan to boost wages for teachers:
The average teacher in America would receive a $13,500 raise â€” an increase of about 23 percent to their base pay.
The Department of Education will work with state education agencies to set a base salary goal for beginning teachers in every state. Under Harrisâ€™s plan, states and school districts will increase every teacherâ€™s salary until, at a minimum, they meet the goal.
Americaâ€™s highest-need public schools, which disproportionately serve students of color, will receive funding to increase teacher pay even further.
Harris would also invest billions to â€œelevateâ€ the teaching profession, through teacher and principal residencies and early-career mentoring programs. Half of the funding would go to historically black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve ethnic minorities.
All of this would cost about $315 billion, her campaign says, and would be paid for through an estate tax.
Harris also supports collective bargaining rights for teachers in all states.
Another, non-teacher highlight in her plan:
She wants to require businesses to obtain an equal pay certification that proves theyâ€™re not paying women less than men for doing the same work.
Former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke
Oâ€™Rourke has a massive labor platform that carefully lays out his plan to boost union membership rates.
He wants to guarantee collective bargaining rights for all workers, including government employees, domestic workers, and farmworkers.
Heâ€™s a believer in sectoral bargaining, which makes it easier for workers and their unions to negotiate with multiple employers in an industry.
Oâ€™Rourke wants to strengthen the â€œjoint employerâ€ standard so that corporations canâ€™t use outsourcing and franchising to avoid bargaining with them. Unionized workers would be able to bargain with firms that are not their direct employers but still have power over their working conditions (like McDonaldâ€™s workers who are employed by a franchise, but whose work is heavily controlled by the corporation).
He wants to crack down on the misclassification of gig workers and other workers as independent contractors. Oâ€™Rourke plans to tackle misclassification as one of the top enforcement priorities of his Labor Department, and says he supports turning the â€œABC testâ€ into law, which would presume workers are employees unless their employers can prove otherwise (similar to Californiaâ€™s AB 5 bill).
He wants to establish wage boards in industries with low union membership to deliver immediate wage gains.
Oâ€™Rourke plans to restore the Obama-era overtime rule. The Obama administration proposed raising the salary threshold that entitles workers to overtime pay â€” time and a half for work over 40 hours a week â€” from less than $24,000 to around $50,000. The Trump administration is now seeking to replace the Obama rule with one raising the threshold to less than $36,000.
Sen. Bernie Sanders
Sanders has done perhaps more than any candidate to move Democrats toward more progressive labor policies. He sponsored the Raise the Wage Act and came out with a dramatic labor platform last month.
As Voxâ€™s Tara Golshan explains, rebuilding union membership is central to Sandersâ€™ platform. His plan outlines a series of executive orders and bills that aim to strengthen union membership, punish employers who engage in union-busting practices, and raise wages and benefits.
Hereâ€™s what Sanders is proposing to do, without Congress:
End federal contracts with employers that pay workers less than $15 an hour without benefits, pay executives more than 150 times more than average workers, and hire workers to replace striking workers or outsources jobs.
Put a moratorium on pension cuts.
Much of Sandersâ€™s plan, like many other candidatesâ€™ plans, would require legislation. That includes:
Creation of a sectoral collective bargaining system where boards set minimum standards for an entire industry, including minimum pay and benefits
Giving all government employees the right to unionize
Banning at-will employment, which allows businesses to fire employees at any time and for any reason. This would require companies to fire employees for a â€œjust cause.â€
Requiring companies to begin negotiating with a union within 10 days of receiving a request, setting up a system of both mediation and binding arbitration if employers try to drag their feet on negotiating a first contract.
Repealing the provision in the Taft-Hartley Act that allows states to pass â€œright to workâ€ laws. Twenty-eight states have these laws on the books, allowing workers to opt out of paying union dues, ultimately weakening the union representation.
Codifying the Browning-Ferris joint-employer standard, an Obama-era National Labor Relations Board decision that redefined who technically â€œemploysâ€ US workers by acknowledging an employee can have more than one employer (for example, a temp agency and the company contracting with it could both be one temp workerâ€™s employer), and therefore can participate in collective bargaining.
Making it easier for workers to strike. First, the plan gives federal workers the right to strike. Currently, while federal employees are allowed to form a union, they arenâ€™t allowed to strike. The plan supports a ban on employers permanently replacing striking workers. It also backs workers who want to participate in a secondary boycott to pressure their employers around clients or suppliers.
Sanders just released another big plan that would give employees an ownership stake in the companies where they work. It would also require corporations to reserve 45 percent of their board seats for employees. Read Tara Golshanâ€™s explainer here.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren
So far, Warren has one of the most ambitious labor platforms of all the 2020 candidates. She recently released her plan to overhaul US labor laws, which includes a long list of promises to close every loophole and fix every broken policy that has kept working families from getting ahead in the post-recession economy. Oh, and she wants to give workers new rights too, such as the right for gig workers to unionize.
In many ways, Warrenâ€™s ideas mirror some of Sen. Bernie Sandersâ€™s proposals, like making it easier for workers to go on strike and letting unions bargain on behalf of an entire industry. But Warren also focuses on the minutiae â€” the little tweaks and changes that could make a real difference for working Americans.
Here are the highlights:
One of the big ideas sheâ€™s endorsing is the concept of sectoral bargaining, in which unions bargain not at the company level but at the sector level â€” negotiating for all workers in an entire industry rather than just one company or workplace.
She is also championing one of her signature congressional plans, the Accountable Capitalism Act. It would require billion-dollar corporations to reserve 40 percent of their board seats for employees. Like this, she argues, CEOs would be more likely to make decisions that benefit workers, not just shareholders or the bottom line.
She also wants to extend the right to unionize to more types of workers, such as government employees and low-level company supervisors.
Warren is also tackling the trifecta of terrible corporate policies that have eroded workersâ€™ rights: non-compete clauses, no-poach agreements, and mandatory arbitration.
Not only would Warren push for a national law that would make it much harder for companies to label employees as independent contractors. She says she would also make misclassification a labor violation, instead of a just a tax issue.
One key part of Warrenâ€™s plan involves boosting funding for agencies that enforce worker safety laws and other labor laws. That includes the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Department of Labor Civil Rights Center.
She plans to deny federal contracting opportunities to companies with poor track records on diversity and equal pay, ban contractors from using forced arbitration and noncompete clauses that restrict workersâ€™ rights, and prohibit them from asking applicants for past salary information and criminal histories.
The labor supportersâ€™ platforms
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard
Gabbard hasnâ€™t said much about labor issues in her campaign. I could only find two specific labor policies she supports: the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and the Paycheck Fairness Act, which strengthens remedies for workers who have experienced pay discrimination.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar
Klobuchar has a fairly vague labor platform. Hereâ€™s what is says about workersâ€™ rights on her campaign website:
As the granddaughter of an iron ore miner and the daughter of a union teacher and a union newspaperman, Amy will bring one clear but simple guide to the White House: When unions are strong, our country is strong. As President, sheâ€™ll stand up against attempts to weaken our unions. That means achieving real labor law reform, ensuring free and fair union elections, protecting collective bargaining rights, rolling back Right to Work laws, and making it easier â€” and not harder â€” for workers to join unions.
In June, Klobuchar did release a list of executive actions she would take in her first 100 days as president, which includes many that would make it easier for workers to join labor unions. For example:
She would require federal contractors to pay no less than $15 an hour to their employees
She would reinstate the Obama-era overtime rule, which would expand the number of workers eligible for overtime pay.
Klobuchar will direct the FTC to develop rule that would bar companies from making low-wage workers sign non-compete clauses.
She would direct the Labor Department to stop fighting efforts to make businesses disclose detailed salary information, including employee pay for workers of different races and genders.
Klobuchar supports reinstating an Obama-era standard of the joint-employer rule, which recognizes that employees may have more than one employer that is responsible for their working conditions.
Klobuchar will also restore an a rule rescinded by President Trump requiring companies to publicly disclose when they hire consultants to counter workersâ€™ efforts to unionize.
Tom Steyer
Billionaire Tom Steyer, along with Gabbard, has the weakest labor platform of all the candidates. Itâ€™s not even appropriate to say he has much of a plan. All we know about Steyer is that he wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and has made a vague promise to strengthen labor unions. He also says he supports paid family leave and affordable child care for working parents, but doesnâ€™t give any details about how that would work.
Andrew Yang
Yang is enthusiastic about equal pay and paid time off but makes no mention of labor unions in his platform. Here are the highlights:
He wants to pay federal workers who are performing the same job the same salary.
He wants to work with states to implement salary disclosure laws.
Heâ€™ll require federal contractors to disclose salary information for their employees (they already do this) and will ban companies that donâ€™t follow equal pay rules.
He wants to pilot studies to see if different policies result in more equitable hiring and pay in the federal workforce (however, the pay gap is actually more of a problem in the private sector than in the federal government).
He wants to require employers to offer at least six to nine months of paid family leave.
Yang plans to create a tax refund of up to $1,000 to help cover the cost of moving expenses for any Americans relocating for work.
He wants to reevaluate professional licenses and remove the requirement that federal contracts go to people with licenses that are deemed unnecessary.
Yang promises to work with state licensure boards to increase the mobility of professional licenses from state to state.
He wants to require employers to give full-time workers at least four weeks of paid time off, except for new companies less than nine years old and small companies with fewer than 50 employees."
"When President Donald Trump was displayed on screen at Nationals Park during Game 5 of the World Series Sunday night, he was greeted with a chorus of boos â€” and then, a chant of â€œlock him up.â€
And since then, a debate has broken out among some critical of Trump in the political world. Was â€œlock him upâ€ an acceptable way to taunt this perennially under-investigation president? Or was it a troubling sign of the deterioration of norms about the rule of law and political disagreement?
The context, of course, is that the chant is a variation of the â€œlock her upâ€ chant â€” aimed at Hillary Clinton â€” that has been a mainstay of Trump events since 2016, and that Trump has been much-criticized for encouraging.
So MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski argued Monday morning that the chants were â€œsickeningâ€ when Trump supporters did them â€” and that they were also â€œsickeningâ€ when aimed at Trump himself.
For that, the pair faced a torrent of Twitter criticism, mostly based around the retort that, actually, the two situations are quite different â€” either because of the differences between Trump and Clintonâ€™s scandals, or the differing contexts (a baseball crowd vs. a political rally).
But within that backlash, there was an interesting split among some who argued that the sports fans shouldnâ€™t be taken literally or seriously â€” and others who argued that, no, Trump really has committed serious crimes and he really should be in prison. The divide is a sign of differing viewpoints both on political rhetoric and on criminal prosecutions more generally.
The controversy comes just days after Trumpâ€™s own lawyer argued that, even if Trump murders someone in broad daylight, no charges can be brought against him while he is president. And despite the seemingly trivial setting, the incident does raise questions about how the Democratic Party will handle the issue of potential Trump administration criminality going forward.
How â€œlock her upâ€ became â€œlock him upâ€
The now-infamous â€œlock her upâ€ chant rocketed to national prominence at the Republican National Convention in July 2016.
The immediate context was that, just two weeks earlier, then-FBI Director James Comey had announced that he would recommend no charges against Hillary Clinton after investigating her use of a personal email account for State Department business â€” dashing Republicansâ€™ hopes that Clinton would end up indicted.
But the fuller context is that, for decades, Republican base voters had been told by their politicians and media sources that the Clinton family was guilty of all sorts of nefarious crimes, from kooky mass murder conspiracy theories to supposed financial corruption. And if you become convinced that someone is a criminal, itâ€™s natural to want her imprisoned.
So, in speech after speech at the convention, â€œlock her upâ€ became the favorite chant of the crowd of delegates â€” sometimes egged on by speakers from the stage. After that, the chant became omnipresent at Trump rallies. Trump himself doesnâ€™t lead the chant, but he usually stands by and lets it happen, and has sometimes chimed in with something to the effect of â€œlock her up is right.â€
This struck many commentators as quite disturbing â€” Trump was running for the highest office in the nation on the platform that his opponent should be imprisoned. Furthermore, there was widespread consensus among legal analysts (except for some hardcore Republican partisans) that Clintonâ€™s conduct in the email case wasnâ€™t chargeable. Comey insisted that â€œno reasonable prosecutorâ€ would bring such a case. But Trump responded by simply asserting that this was all the corrupt Obama administration trying to protect Clinton.
After Trump won the presidency, he continued to try and politicize the Justice Department, urging prosecutors to investigate his opponents â€” and many are wary that a recent investigation into the origins of the Russia probe is just that (though Clinton herself remains un-indicted). Instead, itâ€™s been a plethora of Trump associates (from campaign chair Paul Manafort to national security adviser Michael Flynn to lawyer Michael Cohen) who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to crimes.
Additionally, Trumpâ€™s own activities have been scrutinized by special counsel Robert Mueller and prosecutors in the US Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Southern District of New York. But Mueller ended up deciding to take no position on whether Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice â€” in part because the Justice Department had previously held that a sitting president canâ€™t be indicted. And though SDNYâ€™s probe spurred Cohen to say in court that he violated campaign finance law by making hush-money payments at Trumpâ€™s instruction, prosecutors have taken no further action in the case for unclear reasons.
Meanwhile, Trumpâ€™s critics also point to other potentially criminal conduct â€” from sexual assault allegations to apparent corruption involving his business â€” that seems not to have even been seriously investigated by law enforcement.
Into all this comes the World Series crowd
So then, on Sunday night, came the baseball crowd chant that launched a thousand takes:
Naturally, Trump-supporting conservatives werenâ€™t enthused about all this. But a split quickly manifested among Trump critics as well.
For instance, several commentators who focus on legal issues felt rather queasy about seeing this favorite tactic of Trumpâ€™s used against him â€” believing in the importance of due process, and feeling hesitant to argue that anyone be â€œlocked upâ€ before a fair trial.
Others intermingled this due process concern with more of a focus on â€œcivilityâ€ or, as Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) put it, a belief that â€œthe office of the president deserves respect, even when the actions of our president at times donâ€™t.â€
Coons added, â€œIt reminds me of things that happen in countries where rule of law is unknown or unestablished. And sort of whipping up public furor on both sides, I donâ€™t think is constructive or helpful.â€
MSNBCâ€™s Scarborough and Brzezinski voiced similar views. â€œItâ€™s un-American,â€ Scarborough complained. â€œItâ€™s sickening. We are Americans, and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant â€˜lock him upâ€™ to this president or to any president.â€
The interesting split among those who defended the chant
Other Trump critics responded with scorn or derision at those rebukes, seeing them as an attempt to chide baseball fans for not protesting the president properly. But while this second group of critics was united in agreement that the chant was fine, there seems to be an underlying difference in their reasons for coming to that conclusion.
Some commentators, for instance, stressed the particular context here â€” that this was a crowd taunting an incumbent president to his face with his own words, making it more of a form of protest, in contrast to a crowd urging a potential (or actual) president to lock up despised political opponents:
Whatâ€™s seemingly implicit in these arguments is that, in a different context â€” say, a Democratic presidential campaign â€” chants of â€œlock him upâ€ aimed at Trump would indeed be inappropriate.
However, other chant defenders took a different tack, arguing that Trumpâ€™s alleged crimes are indeed far worse than Hillary Clintonâ€™s, and do indeed merit his â€œlocking up.â€
All this would seemingly imply that, yes, Democratic crowds chanting in favor of Trumpâ€™s imprisonment would be perfectly appropriate â€” because he should in fact be charged and imprisoned. (Though there is some variation in what, exactly, these critics think Trump should be imprisoned for â€” as there was for Clintonâ€™s critics.)
Partly, this is a debate about political rhetoric and messaging. Trump made the case that Clinton was corrupt by simply stating that she should be in prison. Now that Democrats are faced with the challenge of convincing voters Trump is corrupt, some wonder, should they really hold back, when they feel his behavior is far more egregious?
Thereâ€™s also a revealing difference in temperament seen in Sen. Coonsâ€™s comments that â€œwhipping up public furorâ€ isnâ€™t â€œhelpful.â€ Those with this viewpoint fear mob justice or the politicization of justice, and prefer that decisions about criminal charges be left in the hands of the professionals. But others believe the pendulum has swung too far toward elite impunity â€” they no longer trust the professionals to properly hold the powerful accountable.
And this debate that may not be purely rhetorical forever. If a Democratic candidate does win next yearâ€™s elections, he or she will get to staff the top levels of the Justice Department in early 2021. That new administration will face a series of choices about whether itâ€™s best to just move on â€” or, perhaps, whether to try and lock some people up.

"Brexit â€” a portmanteau for â€œBritish exitâ€ â€” has generated a lot of very specific lingo.
And those terms to describe and define the United Kingdomâ€™s breakup with the European Union can sometimes make this already complicated process even harder to follow.
Hereâ€™s a handy glossary of Brexit terms, with some links to more in-depth coverage, to help you better understand this slow-moving political divorce ahead of the new January 31, 2020 deadline.
Article 50
This is a section in the European Unionâ€™s Treaty of Lisbon, the international agreement that lays out how the EU functions. Article 50 gives member states the power to leave the bloc.
The United Kingdom triggered Article 50 on March 29, 2017, when then-British Prime Minister Theresa May gave notice to European Council President Donald Tusk that the UK planned to leave the bloc. That kicked off the formal start of EU-UK negotiations and the two-year countdown until the UKâ€™s official exit.
The Article 50 period for the UK was set to expire on March 29, 2019, but the rest of the EU member states agreed to extend it until at least April 12.
May asked for another extension in April, and EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit again, this time until October 31, 2019. Any postponement requires the unanimous agreement of all EU member states.
When Prime Minister Boris Johnson took office in July, he promised to take the UK out of the EU on that date; but he, too, ended up having to seek an extension because of an act of Parliament. The EU has now agreed to delay Brexit until January 31, 2020.
The UK does have the unilateral authority to revoke Article 50 and essentially cancel Brexit, at least according to a December ruling from the European Court of Justice. A petition on the UK Parliamentâ€™s website calling for the revocation of Article 50 reached nearly 6 million signatures in March.
Brexiteer
A term that refers to hardliners, who tend to come from the right-wing of the Conservative Party, who ardently support the UKâ€™s exit from the EU. Brexiteers want the UK to extricate itself from EU institutions and regulations as much as possible.
Brexit deal
This refers to the plan to take the UK out of the EU. Former Prime Minister May and the EU negotiated one last year â€” and Johnson and the EU made some tweaks and delivered a revised version in October.
There are two components: the 585-page withdrawal agreement, which is the legal text that lays out the terms of the breakup, and a shorter political declaration that establishes that the UK and EU will seek to negotiate a yet-to-be-determined future relationship.
The deal provides for a transition period after Brexit, which the UK and the EU will use to negotiate a future partnership. The UK must approve the deal and implement it into UK law through legislation before it can begin those talks on the future UK-EU relationship. So far, that has proven impossible: Parliament has rejected Mayâ€™s full Brexit deal twice, including once in January by a historic 230-vote margin. It also voted down just the withdrawal agreement in March 2019.
Johnson tried to rush the legislation for Brexit deal through Parliament last week, in an attempt to take the UK out of the EU by that October 31 deadline. Though Parliament voted to advance the bill, it rejected Johnsonâ€™s three-day timeline. As a result, the Brexit deal is now stuck in limbo â€” Parliamentâ€™s given the okay to move forward, but itâ€™s not clear when, exactly, that will happen.
(You can read more about the current version of the Brexit deal here.)
Common Market 2.0 (sometimes also known as â€œNorway plusâ€)
This is a very soft Brexit plan favored by some UK members of Parliament (MPs). This plan, which would keep the UK in very close alignment with the EU.
It would likely involve the UK joining the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which is made up of Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland, and Switzerland. EFTA countries have access to the EU single market through the European Economic Area, which means even though these countries arenâ€™t formally part of the EU they all allow for the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor (people) between borders.
EFTA countries have to contribute to the EU budget and follow a lot of EU rules, though theyâ€™re exempt from some regulations. At the same time, these EFTA countries have less leverage when it comes to shaping the EU rules than EU members.
The Common Market 2.0 plan also calls on the UK to remain part of the customs union, or reach some sort of customs union arrangement to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (another EU member state.)
Norway and all the other EFTA countries arenâ€™t part of the EU customs union, however, so thatâ€™s a potential complication with this plan.
Customs union
The European Union customs union promotes frictionless trade between all the 28 current EU member states by removing tariffs and duties and other barriers to trade (like quotas).
Thanks to the customs union, the EU operates as one unit when it comes to trading with the outside world, so all member states impose the same external tariffs when trading with other countries â€” whether itâ€™s the US or China. This prevents individual member states from striking out on their own, and forming independent trade deals â€” something Brexiteers really want to do.
Some countries, such as Turkey, have customs union agreements with the EU that cover certain goods.
European Research Group (ERG)
This term, which refers to a group of hardline Conservatives in the UK is something of a misnomer. Theyâ€™re actually deeply skeptical of the EU, and want to leave it.
Flextension
After Johnson was forced to ask the EU for another Brexit extension in October, the EU agreed to delay Brexit again, this time until January 31, 2020. But the EU said it would be flexible; specifically, if the UK could pass the Brexit deal legislation earlier, then it could opt for an earlier exit date, specifically, on either December 1 or January 1.
Free trade agreement (FTA)
This is the Brexiteersâ€™ favored trade approach to any future EU-UK future relationship.
UK would plan on striking a trade agreement or a series of agreements to reduce trade barriers, which would ideally replace the customs union or single market membership and remove the UK from most of the EU institutions. This is sometimes referred to as a Canada-style Brexit, as the model would be the trade deal the EU has with Canada.
Hard Brexit
This is the scenario favored by hardline Brexiteers.
The UK and the EU would make a clean break of things, and would then try to negotiate some sort of free trade deal. The UK would gain control over things like immigration and borders, but it would also lose the perks of being part of the European Union single market and customs union.
Indicative votes
These are nonbinding votes in the UK Parliament on a series of resolutions that, in the Brexit case, are supposed to show which kinds of Brexit plans can win a majority in the House of Commons.
MPs can vote on as many options as they want, or none at all.
Parliament voted on eight different Brexit options on March 27, but none received the majority of votes. Parliament narrowed those options down and voted on four options on April 1, but all failed again â€” though the permanent customs union option only lost by three votes.
(You can read more about indicative votes here and here.)
Irish backstop
This is a so-called insurance policy in the Brexit deal that prevents the establishment of a hard border â€” meaning physical customs checks â€” between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) once the UK leaves the EU.
The backstop plan was included in the withdrawal agreement that May negotiated with the EU. It stipulated that if the two sides canâ€™t figure out a viable way to avoid checks on the Northern Ireland-Ireland border at the end of a transition period after Brexit, the UK will remain within the customs union, with Northern Ireland following additional EU rules.
The UK couldnâ€™t pull out of the agreement unilaterally, although the EU offered additional legal assurances that gives the UK the ability to challenge the terms of the backstop if it feels the EU isnâ€™t negotiating in good faith.
Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson, opposed the backstop, as they felt it trapped the UK within the EU after Brexit. Johnson kept trying to get rid of it, but the EU said that was a non-starter unless Johnson could come up with a viable alternative to avoid a hard border.
Finally, the two sides fudged a new plan that would instead take all of the UK out of the EU customs union, but allow Northern Ireland to remain aligned with EU rules on certain goods. The plan would put checks on goods moving from the rest of the UK into Northern Ireland. Itâ€™s complicated, and opposed by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in Northern Ireland because it treats Northern Ireland different than the rest of the UK. But Parliamentâ€™s been a lot more open to this than Mayâ€™s deal.
(You can read more about the Irish backstop here and Johnsonâ€™s replacement here.)
Meaningful vote
The phrase â€œmeaningful voteâ€ refers to a requirement that the UK Parliament must approve any Brexit deal that the UK negotiates with the EU.
Pro-European MPs successfully won this with the EU Withdrawal Bill, the legislation passed by Parliament in 2018 which is also known as the â€œGreat Repeal Bill,â€ which ends the authority of EU law over the UK, but also puts some EU law into domestic law to reduce some of the chaos after Brexit.
Parliament has held two so-called â€œmeaningful votesâ€ on the Brexit deal â€” and each time, MPs have voted down the agreement. (The third defeat of Mayâ€™s withdrawal agreement wasnâ€™t a full meaningful vote because it did not include the political declaration.)
Johnson is trying to repeal the need for a â€œmeaningful voteâ€ as part of his Brexit legislation, so that once the bill implementing the deal into UK law is passed, it makes the meaningful vote unnecessary.
No-confidence vote
This could happen with or without Brexit. A no-confidence vote, or motion of no confidence, in Parliament happens when MPs vote on whether they want to continue supporting the current government led by Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party, which lost its majority in September.
If Johnson wins the vote, nothing happens. If he loses a no-confidence vote, members of Parliament typically have 14 days to try to form an alternative government.
If MPs fail to form a government, it could lead to general elections. But when those elections are to take place â€” before or after the Brexit deadline â€” could be the crucial question.
No-deal Brexit
This is a chaotic scenario in which the UK leaves the EU without any deal or transition period in place. The UKâ€™s current agreements with the EU on trade, security, travel, and more were set to expire on October 31, 2019, though the EU has agreed to push back that deadline to January 31, 2020.
Political declaration
This refers to the second part of the Brexit deal, which says that after the UK-EU divorce, the two parties will establish a future relationship on trade, security, and other issues.
The political declaration is extremely nonspecific by design, to allow for both hard and soft Brexit options. But this is also why many MPs, including many supporters of a soft Brexit, oppose it.
They want the UK and the EU to tweak the language to offer more clarity on that future relationship by saying the UK will join a customs union or single market. This is intended to bind a current or future prime minister to use this as a negotiating framework.
Prorogation
Proroguing is the formal way to end one parliamentary session before starting the business of a new one.
This also isnâ€™t strictly a Brexit thing, but Boris Johnson made it one when, at the end of August, he asked Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue â€” that is, suspend â€” Parliament for five weeks, in what very much looked like an attempt to limit Parliamentâ€™s ability to stop a no-deal Brexit. The queen agreed, which was expected, as asking her permission is mostly a formality.
Proroguing Parliament is a fairly typical practice, especially when a new government comes in. But the suspension usually only lasts a week or two. Thatâ€™s partly why critics have decried Johnsonâ€™s five-week ask as unprecedented and an attempted â€œcoup,â€ particularly as it comes just weeks ahead of the UKâ€™s scheduled departure date.
Johnsonâ€™s prorogation decision was challenged in court, and the UKâ€™s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson acted unlawfully because his intention was to frustrate and prevent Parliament from carrying out its constitutional duties. It made the prorogation void, meaning Parliament returned to the legislation session. Johnson then suspended Parliament again, but just for a few days â€” an acceptable, lawful amount of time.
(Read more about Johnsonâ€™s proroguing controversy here, and read about the UK Supreme Courtâ€™s decision.)
Second referendum
This is also known as a â€œpeopleâ€™s voteâ€ or confirmatory public vote. Advocates of a second referendum want the public to vote on the final Brexit deal approved by Parliament. They would basically get to say whether they want this version of Brexit, or would prefer to stick with the current deal, which is the UKâ€™s current EU membership.
A march in October drew hundreds of thousands in support of a second referendum. But, so far, a second referendum has failed to gain traction in Parliament, and the prime minister definitely doesnâ€™t support it.
(You can read more about a second referendum here.)
Single market
The single market ensures the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within and between all European Union member states. The EU has defended these â€œfour freedomsâ€ as inviolable, meaning itâ€™s all four or nothing at all, and the EU has rejected any attempts to cherrypick.
Soft Brexit
A â€œsoftâ€ Brexit means a much less severe break with the EU than some of the other scenarios that have been proposed.
Broadly speaking, the UK would stay close to the EU and potentially retain access to either the single market and customs union, or both. The UK would also have to abide by many of the EU laws and regulations that govern the single market and customs union. And since it would no longer be an EU member, the UK would have little or no say in what those rules are or how theyâ€™re applied.
Withdrawal agreement
This is the very long divorce settlement negotiated by the UK and the EU that resolves some of the legal and technical issues of the breakup. The plan calls for a transition period where the UK will formally leave the EU and have no decision-making power, but will remain within its trade and security arrangements until December 2020. (The transition period can be renewed once, until 2022.)
The withdrawal agreement deals with the status of millions of EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. It lays out how much the UK owes the EU for the divorce (Â£39 billion, or about $50 billion). It previously included that Irish backstop, but now includes the revised plan for Northern Ireland."
"Rep. Katie Hill, a first-term Democrat from California, has announced her resignation after being accused of having sexual relationships with staffers.
The story is a complicated one. The allegations first surfaced on RedState, a conservative website known for its devotion to President Trump. Earlier this month, the site reported that Hill and her husband had, until recently, been involved in a sexual relationship with a staffer in her 20s who worked on Hillâ€™s campaign. The story included explicit images purporting to be of Hill and the staffer.
Then, last week, the site published what it said were text messages between Hillâ€™s husband, Kenny Heslep, and the staffer that suggest the staffer was abused in the relationship.
Meanwhile, RedState has also reported that Hill was having an affair with her legislative director, Graham Kelly.
Hill has denied having a sexual relationship with Kelly but, last week, she admitted to having a relationship with the campaign staffer.
And on Sunday, Hill announced her resignation. â€œThis is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country,â€ she said in a statement.
But ever since the allegations came to light, Hill has emphasized that the images published by RedState were released without her consent. She has also implied that Heslep, with whom she is in divorce proceedings, might be responsible.
â€œThe fact is I am going through a divorce from an abusive husband who seems determined to try to humiliate me,â€ Hill said in a statement to the Washington Post earlier this month.
The allegations against Hill are serious. As the Washington Post notes, it is against the code of conduct adopted by Congress last year for legislators to engage in sexual relationships with their staff. Prior to her resignation, the House Ethics Committee had announced an investigation into the allegation of her relationship with Kelly.
The code of conduct does not cover campaign staff, but many advocates say thereâ€™s a fundamental problem with an employer having a sexual relationship with an employee. There are â€œinherent power dynamics involved with superiors and their subordinates, which makes the issue of consent difficult,â€ Ally Coll, co-founder of the anti-sexual harassment organization the Purple Campaign, told Vox.
The texts hinting at abuse make the allegation even more troubling. At the same time, if Hill is correct, the allegations may have emerged as part of what was essentially an act of revenge porn: It is illegal in California, Washington, DC, and elsewhere to try to hurt someone by distributing naked photographs of that person without consent. Meanwhile, the fact that Hill is one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress may be contributing to the way the allegations have been portrayed. RedStateâ€™s headlines, for example, appeared to stoke salacious interest in the story by referring to Hillâ€™s alleged â€œ2-Yr Throuple Relationship.â€
Hill is not the first woman to be accused of sexual misconduct or inappropriate relationships in recent years, and the allegations are the latest reminder that such misconduct is not only the province of powerful men. However, theyâ€™re also a reminder that the gender and sexual orientation of the person accused have an effect on how allegations come to light and how the media responds.
Hill had a sexual relationship with a campaign staffer. She is also accused of a relationship with a congressional staffer, which she denies.
Hill, 32, beat Republican incumbent Steve Knight in 2018 to represent Californiaâ€™s 25th Congressional District, which spans parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. She was part of a congressional class that included a record-breaking number of women, as well as a number of historic firsts. As reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee noted at the Post, she is also one of the first openly bisexual people to serve in Congress.
Prior to the allegations, Hill was â€œconsidered a rising star among the Democrats,â€ Lee writes, and was one of the â€œBig Sixâ€ first-term members of Congress to serve in major leadership roles. But Hill began faced scrutiny earlier this month, when RedState reported that she and her husband had been involved in a relationship with a female campaign staffer, beginning in 2017 and ending after Hill moved to Washington in 2019.
The site posted photos it said depicted the women together, with the face of the staffer, who was not named, blurred out. In one of the images, a woman identified by RedState as Hill is nude.
In a follow-up story, RedState published texts purportedly between the staffer and Hillâ€™s husband, Heslep, alluding to abusive behavior in the relationship.
â€œIt was a dark time and you treated me really poorly but I also stayed which I have to own,â€ one of the texts, purportedly from the staffer to Heslep, reads.
According to RedState, Heslep replied, â€œDonâ€™t take full responsibility for staying with people that are abusing you. That is basically victim blaming, and none of it was your fault.â€
In one text to the staffer, Heslep referred to â€œkaties abuse,â€ according to RedState. And in another, the staffer referred to a hobby she enjoyed, according to the website: â€œShe can ruin politics, take all my friends, and isolate me, but she canâ€™t have [this].â€
Meanwhile, RedState also reported that Hill had been involved in a year-long affair with her congressional legislative director, Kelly, which caused her husband to file for divorce.
Hill has not responded to a request for comment from Vox, but she said in a statement to the Post that â€œallegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false.
â€œI am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties,â€ the statement continued.
Then, in a separate statement to constituents on Wednesday, Hill acknowledged a relationship with the female campaign staffer.
â€œDuring the final tumultuous years of my abusive marriage, I became involved in a relationship with someone on my campaign,â€ she said in a statement, according to CNN. â€œI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment.â€
Hill also apologized, adding, â€œI wish nothing but the best for her and hope everyone respects her privacy in this difficult time.â€
However, she also decried the manner in which the relationship came to light. â€œDistributing intimate photos with the intent to publish them is a crime, and the perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law,â€ she said, adding that she had notified Capitol police about the leak of the photos.
Under Washingtonâ€™s â€œrevenge pornâ€ law, enacted in 2014, itâ€™s illegal to try to harm someone by disseminating nude photographs of that person without consent, and perpetrators can face up to three years in prison. Such laws, now on the books in more than 30 states, are a response to a very real problem: According to one 2016 study, one in 25 Americans has been a victim of â€œrevenge porn.â€ (Heslep did not respond to the Postâ€™s request for comment.)
In announcing her resignation on Sunday, Hill added that she would work to stop revenge porn after leaving office. â€œMy fight is going to be to defeat this type of exploitation that so many women are victims to and which will keep countless women and girls from running for office,â€ she said.
The allegations are serious. Theyâ€™re not necessarily being treated seriously.
Regardless of how the allegations came about, they had serious implications for Hill from the beginning.
Last year, the House adopted new ethics rules barring members from having sexual relationships with staffers. The rules donâ€™t explicitly apply to campaign staffers like the one involved in a previous relationship with Hill and Heslep, but, Lee reports, the House Ethics Committee has determined it has jurisdiction over â€œmisconduct relating to a successful campaign for election to the House.â€
In general, â€œit is best practice for organizations to prohibit romantic relationships within either a direct or indirect reporting relationship,â€ said Coll, who co-founded the Purple Campaign after speaking out about her own experience being groped by a senator when she was an 18-year-old intern. A relationship with a boss can put pressure on the subordinate to consent, Coll said, as well as creating an â€œappearance of impropriety or favoritismâ€ that affects others in the workplace.
And when the employer is a politician, allegations of sexual misconduct â€” and how theyâ€™re handled â€” matter to voters, Coll said. â€œResearch shows that more than half of voters say that they would not vote for somebody who is accused of sexual harassment, or, more importantly, somebody who did not make addressing sexual harassment a priority,â€ she explained. â€œPeople, myself included, want to see lawmakers lead by example, and I think that starts with taking responsibility for their own offices and their own campaigns.â€
Even before the allegations became public, Hill was expected to have a difficult reelection campaign in 2020, according to the New York Times.
The allegations against Hill came after multiple members of Congress, including Sen. Al Franken (D-MN), have resigned amid accusations of sexual misconduct. The ethics rules last year were part of a broader reckoning with that reality, which also included legislation to make it easier for staffers to report misconduct.
While the only members of Congress to resign after allegations have been men, Hill is not the first powerful woman to face such allegations in recent years. California State Assemblymember Cristina Garcia, for instance, was accused last year of groping a male staffer. An investigation failed to corroborate the claims but found that she had used vulgar language, and Garcia, who had been honored as a â€œsilence breakerâ€ in the Me Too movement by Time magazine, was removed from her committee memberships.
Meanwhile, the fact that Hill is bisexual and a woman may have impacted the way the allegations against her have been covered and received by the public. The headlines and stories on RedState focused on her sexual orientation and relationship status, with headlines including â€œBisexual Rep. Katie Hill Allegedly Left Her Husband For Her (Male) Finance Directorâ€ and â€œCA Rep. Katie Hill Allegedly Involved Female Staffer In 2-Yr â€˜Throupleâ€™ Relationship.â€
Other conservative outlets are leaning hard on the â€œthroupleâ€ angle, with the Washington Examiner titling a story â€œSwing district: Katie Hill 2020 rivals seize on leaked naked â€˜throupleâ€™ photo as campaign issue,â€ and Fox News reporting, â€œRep. Katie Hill fights back amid claims she was involved in romantic â€˜throupleâ€™ with staffer.â€
Meanwhile, the Daily Mail published additional photos purportedly of Hill last week, touting â€œa series of shocking photographs obtained exclusively by DailyMail.comâ€ and accusing Hill of â€œposing nude on â€˜wife-sharingâ€™ sites.â€
And among ordinary internet users, â€œthroupleâ€ was the top Google search term linked to Hillâ€™s name last week, with â€œphotosâ€ and â€œuncensoredâ€ close behind, indicating that people were searching for the story in the hope of seeing Hill naked. This is, to put it mildly, not how the allegations against Sen. Franken were received.
All told, the story of Hill and her relationships with staff â€” alleged and confirmed â€” is disturbing in a number of ways, from the very real abuses of power of which she is accused to the way those accusations are being conflated with Hillâ€™s sexuality and a salacious desire for nude photos of her. Itâ€™s a reminder both that men arenâ€™t the only ones who can engage in sexual misconduct and that coverage of the issue is just as vulnerable to sexism, homophobia, and biphobia as any other topic."
"The last abortion clinic in Missouri is battling for its existence.
Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region has been operating for 46 years, serving thousands of patients annually for STI testing, cancer screenings, and abortions. But it might have to stop offering abortion care thanks to a months-long dispute with state regulators.
The controversy started after an audit earlier this year, when officials say they found â€œdeficient practicesâ€ at the clinic. While they havenâ€™t been very specific about what those practices are, officials requested interviews with doctors working at the clinic. Some of the doctors agreed, but others did not, possibly fearing that the state would launch criminal proceedings against them. Meanwhile, officials said that if they couldnâ€™t interview all the doctors, they would revoke the clinicâ€™s license to perform abortions.
Beginning Monday, representatives from the clinic and the state will testify at a weeklong series of hearings to determine if the facility can keep its license. If the clinic loses, Missouri residents â€” including more than a million people who can become pregnant â€” will have to travel across state lines if they want to end a pregnancy. Advocates say this will increase the already significant obstacles that patients â€” who are disproportionately low-income â€” face when trying to get the procedure.
The outcome of the hearing could also signal the end of an era in abortion access: if Missouri loses its clinic, it will become the first state with no provider since Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established the right to an abortion in America.
While near-total bans on abortion grabbed headlines earlier this year, states have also been engaged in quieter, more incremental efforts to restrict abortion. Some, including Missouri, have passed restrictions on abortion doctors, laws similar to one in Louisiana that will go before the Supreme Court this term. But Planned Parenthood says it is also using the clinic licensing process as a roundabout way of shutting the clinic down. If the facility has to stop providing abortions, advocates say, it could be the biggest success yet for the strategy of eliminating access without banning the procedure outright.
â€œIt is the moment that we have long been warning about,â€ Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Vox: â€œthe day that abortion access is eliminated without ever overturning Roe.â€
State regulators say they have concerns about the clinic. Itâ€™s not clear what the concerns are.
The clinic that is now Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region was founded in 1973, the year Roe was decided. Planned Parenthood bought the facility in 1996. Over the years, the clinic has been inspected a number of times, and inspectors were always collegial and professional, Dr. David Eisenberg, the clinicâ€™s former medical director who still provides abortions and other care there, told Vox. But things started to change after the appointment of a new director, Dr. Randall Williams, to lead the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services in 2017.
Williams, an OB-GYN, was appointed by former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, and has spoken little publicly about his position on abortion. In an interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch earlier this year, he said only, â€œAbortion is legal in Missouri, and I want it to be safe.â€
But soon after his appointment, Eisenberg said, state regulators essentially started saying, â€œWe have reinterpreted the rules and regulations and found what you do to no longer be compliant.â€ (The health department has not yet responded to Voxâ€™s request for comment.)
The department conducted an audit of the clinic in March, and said it had found â€œdeficient practices,â€ according to Planned Parenthood, but it didnâ€™t clarify what practices it found deficient. In a statement in June, the department said it was â€œreviewing incidents with significant medical evidence which point to troubling instances and deviations from the standard care, resulting in serious patient harm.â€
To further investigate the deficiencies, the health department said it needed to interview all the doctors who practice at the clinic. The two doctors who are Planned Parenthood employees agreed to the interviews â€” but others, who were medical residents affiliated with a St. Louis hospital, did not do so.
The state said the results of the interviews could include â€œboard reviewâ€ or â€œcriminal proceedings,â€ a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said earlier this year. And Planned Parenthood said it could not force the residents to sit for interviews because they were not employees, according to the Kansas City Star.
The clinic was threatened with closure at the end of May, when its license was scheduled to expire and the health department declined to renew it. But a judge issued a preliminary injunction allowing the clinic to stay open.
Since then, the case has been referred to the stateâ€™s Administrative Hearing Commission, which handles disputes between state agencies and private individuals or groups. The commission will hold all-day hearings in the case this Monday through Friday.
Itâ€™s not clear when the commission will issue a decision, but the process could take months, Gilmore said.
Planned Parenthood says the stateâ€™s goal is simple: shut the clinic down
Throughout the process, the state has maintained that there are safety issues at the clinic. According to the statement issued by the health department in June, officials are â€œconcerned by the refusal of physicians to provide explanations for the deeply troubling instances of patient care and conduct under investigation.â€
Details about the departmentâ€™s concerns have been difficult to obtain â€” the statement of deficiencies was not made public. But a conference call between state officials and anti-abortion activists in May suggests that the state wanted to investigate â€œfailedâ€ abortions, in which a patient remained pregnant, and the number of ambulance visits to the clinic, according to the Kansas City Star.
Planned Parenthood, meanwhile, says the concerns about patient care are essentially a ruse, and the stateâ€™s real goal is simply to shut down the clinic. â€œThe state of Missouri has waged political theater in order to ban abortion,â€ Gilmore said.
The organization points to the May conference call between Steele Shippy, then-communications director for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, and Republican legislators and anti-abortion activists. The email invitation to the call ended with the phrase â€œ#shutthemdown,â€ the Kansas City Star reported.
On the call, Shippy said that media would ask whether the stateâ€™s goal was to shut the clinic down. â€œWhile some of us, yes, itâ€™s a main goal, but it also should be our main goal to protect the health and safety of women,â€ Shippy said.
The governorâ€™s office declined to comment to Vox for this story. Shippy, who is now Parsonâ€™s campaign manager in his reelection campaign, has said that the call was nor arranged by the governorâ€™s office. He is scheduled to testify at the hearings this week.
The closure of the clinic would mark a new era for abortion in America
Ahead of the hearings, Planned Parenthood said the stakes could not be higher. Even with the clinic open, â€œthereâ€™s over a million womenâ€ of reproductive age â€œin the state of Missouri with one freestanding health center providing abortion care,â€ Eisenberg said. If the clinic no longer provides abortions, any of those people facing an unwanted pregnancy would have to go to another state for care.
The majority of people seeking abortions in America are low-income, which means that traveling added distances can be a real financial hardship, especially if it means extra time off work. Last week, Planned Parenthood opened a new clinic just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, in Illinois, which could see Missourians if the Missouri clinic cannot. But other neighboring states, like Iowa, Kentucky, and Kansas, are restricting abortion access, not expanding it.
Meanwhile, the battle with state regulators is already having an effect, according to Eisenberg. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of confusion,â€ he said. â€œPeople think that abortionâ€™s no longer available, when it is.â€
And the outcome of the hearing will have implications outside Missouri too. In the last year, states around the country have passed strict bans on abortion. A Missouri law, for example, bans the procedure at eight weeks into pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest. But all these laws, including Missouriâ€™s, have been blocked by courts.
Another, quieter movement against abortion, however, may be coming to fruition. Since 2010, states have been passing restrictions on abortion clinics and providers that have had the effect of shutting clinics down. A 2016 Supreme Court decision, Whole Womanâ€™s Health v. Hellerstedt, found several such restrictions in Texas unconstitutional and struck a major blow to them nationwide. But since then, President Trump has appointed two conservative justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, to the court.
And earlier this month, the court announced it would hear the case June Medical Services v. Gee, which concerns a law in Louisiana very similar to those at issue in Whole Womanâ€™s Health. Many abortion-rights advocates fear that the court will rule in favor of Louisiana, essentially giving states a green light to pass more and more onerous restrictions on clinics until abortion is impossible to access, even if itâ€™s not banned outright.
The conflict in Missouri right now is about health department regulation and inspections, not laws. But, Gilmore said, the situation is still similar to the one in Louisiana â€” officials are â€œusing the regulatory process under the guise of health and safetyâ€ to try to stamp out abortion in the state.
If the clinic does stop providing abortions, it will likely be seen as a sign by advocates on both sides of the issue that the strategy of restricting or regulating abortion out of existence is working.
That could have the effect of keeping doctors from entering the field of abortion care, Eisenberg said, exacerbating an existing shortage of abortion doctors in many places. Faced with increasing restrictions, they may feel that â€œthis is ridiculous, Iâ€™m going to go find something else to do where the governmentâ€™s not going to get in my way,â€ he said.
But, he said, the situation in Missouri should also galvanize activism around abortion rights: â€œfor anyone who cares about the rights of people who can become pregnant in this country, now is the time to get up and fight back.â€"
"Californiaâ€™s electricity system is failing.
Earlier this month, in order to prevent wildfires, some 2 million people had their power cut by the stateâ€™s biggest utility provider, PG&E. It was the biggest deliberate blackout in history.
That record is likely to be broken this week, as the utility contemplates blackouts that could affect up to 3 million people.
Meanwhile, it turns out the Kincade Fire, which currently has 180,000 people evacuating Sonoma County and is only 5 percent contained, may have been started by one of PG&Eâ€™s transmission lines. Thatâ€™s one of the lines it didnâ€™t preemptively shut down, in part thanks to intense pressure from Gov. Gavin Newsom to minimize blackouts.
This, it seems, is what many California electricity customers can expect from now on: blackouts or fires. That is failure.
The first post in this series dug into the causes of that failure, which have been gathering for years now: climate change has made the forests hotter and dryer; forest mismanagement has left them tightly packed and flammable; land-use mismanagement has put more Californians in high-risk areas; decades of delayed and underfunded maintenance has left PG&Eâ€™s 100,000 miles of overhead power lines in a sorry state; and to top things off, PG&E is a felon, burdened with almost $30 billion in debt, thanks to the fires it previously started, and in bankruptcy.
It is an omnishambles.

The second post considered three key ways to, if not â€œsolve,â€ at least ameliorate the conditions making Californiaâ€™s electricity system so vulnerable to wildfires: grid hardening and fire safety; land-use reform, including changes in zoning and building codes; and, of course, repairing and restructuring PG&E, which is very complicated.
This post is about a way to make Californiaâ€™s electricity system cleaner, more reliable, and more resilient. It is, I believe, the only way to truly vouchsafe the promise of safe, reliable electricity in a warming century.
In a nutshell, it is accelerating the evolution from a centralized, top-down, long-distance, one-way energy system to a more decentralized, bottom-up, local, networked system. In the energy world, this is summed up as a more distributed energy system. It puts more power, both electrical and political, in local hands.
Though it is still in early days, and only hints of whatâ€™s to come are yet visible, the evolution to a more distributed system is inevitable. It can be done inefficiently and inequitably, or the state can make sure itâ€™s done expeditiously and fairly, but it is going to happen one way or another.
Weâ€™re going to look at the benefits distributed energy produces and the reasons it is inevitable, but letâ€™s begin with a simpler question: What is it?
What is â€œdistributed energyâ€?
Since it first started growing in earnest in the early 20th century, the grid has worked according to the same basic model. Power is generated at large power plants and fed into high-voltage transmission lines, which can carry it over long distances. At various points along the way, power is dumped from the transmission system into local distribution areas (LDAs) via substations, where transformers lower the voltage. Local distribution grids then carry the electricity to customers.
The â€œTD interfaceâ€ is the point where the transmission and distribution systems meet. Javier Zarracina
Distributed energy is different from the conventional model in that its origin lies within an LDA. Thatâ€™s where it is generated, stored, and managed; no transmission lines are involved.
At the edge of a local distribution grid, the utility hands power off to customers through a meter, which tracks consumption. (Meters are mostly analog, but these days digital â€œsmart metersâ€ are becoming more common.) Once power is â€œbehind the meter,â€ it is in the customerâ€™s hands. The utility has no visibility into or control over it.
Some distributed energy is located in front of the meter, within the distribution grid itself. Think, for instance, of a community solar park or a small local wind farm. We will return to front-of-the-meter distributed energy later.
But for now, when most people talk about distributed energy, they are referring to the kind located behind the meter, like solar panels on roofs and batteries in garages.
Some behind-the-meter distributed energy, some front-of-the-meter distributed energy. Thanks, stock image! Shutterstock
The power from the panels is stored by the batteries or used by the customer directly. Utilities are not involved. They only have access to aggregate consumption data from meters. If a customerâ€™s solar panels generate so much power that it turns their aggregate consumption negative â€” they produce more power than they consume â€” utilities will, at least in California, buy that power from the customer, a policy known as â€œnet metering.â€
(Itâ€™s important to note that the most common form of behind-the-meter distributed energy, in California and across the world, is the old-fashioned diesel generator, which is unfortunate for a wide variety of reasons â€” more on that in a moment.)
A customer with the right kind of equipment (a smart inverter) can â€œislandâ€ off from the grid in the case of power failure, effectively becoming a freestanding electricity system. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people who have installed rooftop solar panels in California do not have a smart inverter and thus canâ€™t island. Many have recently discovered that to their chagrin. To get resilience benefits, solar panels must be coupled with storage and a smart inverter.
Thereâ€™s also a wave of electric vehicles (EVs) coming to California. That will happen alongside a rapid scale-up of â€œvehicle-to-gridâ€ (V2G) technology, which makes EVs into bidirectional energy-storage and demand-shifting resources that can serve the microgrid (or the larger grid). EVs will further increase the reliability and capabilities of behind-the-meter systems.
In theory, a customer could install enough solar panels and batteries to become self-sufficient and cut off its connection to the grid entirely, but true â€œgrid defectionâ€ requires a lot of panels and batteries, along with a suite of other measures, more than most people can afford or manage.
However, especially with Californiaâ€™s rising power rates and declining power reliability, itâ€™s becoming more and more economical to become at least somewhat independent of the grid. A recent McKinsey research report on the effects of energy storage on the power system found that â€œpartial grid defectionâ€ â€” which it defines as generating 80 to 90 percent of your own energy â€” could become economical for most customers within a decade.
The graphic below is based on Arizona retail electricity rates, which are around 11 cents per kWh; Californiaâ€™s are around 16 cents per kWh, the seventh highest in the nation, and are expected to rise:
McKinsey
Partial grid defection is already economical in many places in California, and those areas will spread. For now, solar+storage systems are still a niche product. On average, about 1 in 10 customers that install solar panels install batteries along with them. But thatâ€™s a national average; demand is already beginning to spike in California.
A typical residential battery will cover a typical home for about a half a day in a blackout, depending on the size and consumption of the household. Thatâ€™s not much, but in some circumstances, it can make a crucial difference. And performance will improve as batteries continue to get cheaper and more powerful.
The cool thing about distributed energy is that it scales smoothly to any size, as more and more distributed energy resources (DERS) are networked together. Which brings us to microgrids.
What is a â€œmicrogridâ€?
I wrote an in-depth explainer on microgrids if you want to dive in, but hereâ€™s the capsule version: any system that can island off from the grid is a microgrid, a miniature, semi-independent grid of its own. Technically, a single building, even a single room could be a microgrid, but more often, when people refer to microgrids they are talking about groups of buildings and facilities â€” a campus, a neighborhood, or even a whole community.
With the right equipment and software, a microgrid can coordinate DERs within the group, maximizing local resources while ensuring that enough power is drawn from the larger grid to keep supply and demand matched. (It is possible to have microgrids nested within larger microgrids; a microgrid could even be entirely composed of smaller microgrids, like Russian nesting dolls.)
While there are freestanding microgrids in developing countries, microgrids are typically embedded in larger distribution grids in the US. Most of the time, they remain connected to the grid; they island only in the case of blackouts. From the utilityâ€™s point of view, a microgrid is just another customer, just another meter. What goes on behind the meter, whether itâ€™s one building or 100, doesnâ€™t make much practical difference, except in the size of the account.
You can think of behind-the-meter distributed energy as â€œanything that can help a microgrid work,â€ including energy generation (solar panels, mini wind turbines, biomass boilers), storage (EVs, batteries, and fuel cells), and management (smart meters, inverters, and appliances, home energy management software, microgrid control systems). All of these are DERs.
From my microgrid explainer. You had to be there. Alvin Chang
So thatâ€™s distributed energy: customers generating, storing, and managing their own power, either individually or in networked groups of any size.
Distributed energy is a way of building an energy system from the ground up, focusing on local resilience. It brings all sorts of benefits.
Distributed energy can make the grid more stable and resilient, even when thereâ€™s no blackout
One of the things that has complicated that task of getting more DERs on the grid is that itâ€™s devilishly hard to quantify all their benefits.
On a sheer cost-per-kWh basis, which is how utilities typically make their decisions, central-station power, whether fossil fuel or renewables, is generally cheaper. But such comparisons leave out many of the benefits of distributed energy.
The most relevant to Californians at the moment, of course, is emergency backup power. Lots of people in California are buying diesel generators for this purpose because theyâ€™re fairly cheap and utilities are pushing them via their â€œresilience zoneâ€ plans, but they are dreadful for the task. They create intense local air and noise pollution, they need regular maintenance, and â€” irony of ironies â€” fuel stations run on electricity, so in a blackout, people have only what diesel fuel theyâ€™ve stored.
Solar+storage+smart inverter systems work better and more seamlessly during a blackout. Whatâ€™s more, when they are connected together into a microgrid, their collective generation and consumption can be balanced out, maximizing backup power.
Clean Coalition, a nonprofit leading the charge for DERs in California, has set a goal of seeing every community in the state generate 25 percent of its electricity from local resources. Communities that hit that goal can provide substantial backup power during blackouts. Hereâ€™s what can be achieved with â€œa net zero level of solar to a community in California with energy storage capacity equating to two hours of the nameplate solar capacity (i.e., 2 kWh of energy storage for every 1 kW of solar).â€
Clean Coalition
As you can see, with a balanced portfolio of DERs, including energy storage, the base 10 percent of â€œmission-critical and life-sustaining loadsâ€ can be powered indefinitely. Tier 2 â€œpriorityâ€ loads can run 70 to 80 percent of the time, while discretionary loads will last 20 percent of the time and then begin phasing out.
These are approximate numbers, of course. Every community is unique and every microgrid will be as well. But still, itâ€™s a big, big difference from a community going dark, with only diesel generators to rely on. It could mean the difference between life and death for vulnerable populations like the elderly and disabled.
(Clean Coalition has a page full of success stories about communities that have deployed DERs. Vote Solar has a similar list of solar microgrids in California that provided resiliency benefits, in some cases including life-saving care, during the recent blackouts.)
As Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events continue, emergency-backup benefits will be enough to kick-start a decent microgrid market. Itâ€™s already happening, especially around Tier 1 loads. And customers are herding to solar+storage systems, as Tesla and other companies eye big growth opportunities.

The knock on microgrids has traditionally been that theyâ€™re expensive, but they are already reaching cost parity with California grid power in some places. And while it is true that, on an upfront-capital basis, they are more expensive than diesel generators, they are not more expensive on a lifetime basis because clean DERs, unlike diesel generators, can provide useful services even when thereâ€™s no blackout.
Solar microgrids donâ€™t just provide their owners with backup power when the grid is off and clean energy when itâ€™s on, they offer a number of benefits to the larger grids in which they are embedded.
First, remember that microgrids can island off from the larger grid. To the extent more areas have the capacity to island â€” to the extent the grid is more â€œmodularâ€ rather than one giant interdependent network â€” blackouts can be more carefully targeted. The communities in the path of wildfires can be shut down in an orderly fashion, without the need to black out giant swathes of territory around them.
Second, because they produce power close to consumers, DERs (both in front of and behind the meter) cut down on the need for long-distance grid infrastructure. They can help utilities avoid investments in costly new transmission towers, power poles, transformers, and power lines. At sufficient scale, they can avoid the need for new power plants, with savings running into the billions.
Third is â€œpeak shaving,â€ a subset of avoiding infrastructure. The electricity systems in California and other states are wildly overbuilt; they have to be sized to meet the highest possible peak in demand. Because those peaks in demand are, by definition, exceptions, much of that capacity (especially a large fleet of natural gas â€œpeaker plantsâ€) sits idle much of the time. It is wasteful, again to the tune of billions.

Smart microgrids can help smooth out the peaks and valleys in demand by storing solar energy when itâ€™s plentiful and releasing it from batteries and EVs in times of high usage. They can also shift demand to match supply. The result presented to the utility at the meter is an unusually flat, stable â€œload curve.â€ As more customers clump together into microgrids, more load curves will be flattened and there will be fewer, lower peaks.
That means the bulk energy system of big power plants and long-distance power lines can be downsized, matched more closely to average rather than peak demand. The state could start shutting down natural gas plants.
It also means that some congestion pressure will be taken off existing power lines, which is a big deal, since overloaded lines tend to sag into vegetation and start fires. By relieving congestion, DERs could help make the existing grid less fire-prone.
Finally, DERs can provide important grid services like voltage regulation and phase balancing, to help the grid run more smoothly. (You donâ€™t need to know the details.)
Hereâ€™s a McKinsey graphic that attempts to lay out all the benefits. It is focused on energy storage, but it all holds for microgrids as well:
McKinsey
If and when DERs are compensated properly for all those layered benefits, they can compete with the cost of grid power and vastly undercut diesel generators. They can bring jobs and economic development to local communities. And unlike big power plants and power lines, they can be installed quickly. They are both a short- and a long-term solution for California communities.
Unfortunately, there are very few places in the US that compensate DERs properly. Their benefits tend to be tallied on an ad hoc basis, with metrics and standards varying from state to state, and many benefits are neglected entirely. Thatâ€™s as true in California as in most states.
The state needs to get its act together, though, because the evolution toward distributed energy is inevitable, and if it isnâ€™t well-managed, it could be a humanitarian nightmare.
The inexorable logic of distributed energy in California
The core problem with Californiaâ€™s electricity system is that its millions of customers are overwhelmingly dependent on power generated by large, remote power plants and carried over long distances on overhead power lines, often through hilly, mountainous, and/or forested territory becoming dryer and more fire-prone by the year. If the state continues with the current model, a growing population will mean more power plants, more power lines, more vulnerability to wildfires, and more PSPS events. The system is too vast and sprawling to entirely prevent that, no matter how well trees are trimmed. Over half of wildfires arenâ€™t even caused by electrical infrastructure, but 100 percent of wildfires can burn it.
As blackouts become a regular feature of life in California and their toll becomes more apparent, the cost debates around solar+storage systems are going to fall by the wayside. Those who can afford them are going to get them. Those who canâ€™t afford them will get diesel generators and live with the pollution.
Hereâ€™s the dystopian scenario: As wealthier people begin generating and storing more of their own power, partially or wholly defecting from the grid, they will be less invested in the gridâ€™s health, in two senses.
They will be less politically invested in keeping grid power reliable and cheap, which will take pressure off regulators and legislators. (Wealthier people have more political clout.)
And because they buy less grid power, they will be less financially invested in grid maintenance and other shared grid costs. Utilities can raise fees on solar homeowners to try to capture some of those costs back, as San Diego Gas and Electric is trying to do, but that will just increase the incentive for grid defection.
Increasingly, the costs of building and maintaining the grid will be borne by those without the resources to defect from it, namely lower-income homeowners. And even as fewer ratepayers shoulder them, rates will be rising, as PG&E scrambles to catch up on its giant maintenance backlog.
If the state doesnâ€™t take proactive steps to avoid it, its utilities could end up in a doom spiral, with grid power becoming ever less reliable and more expensive for the underclass forced to rely on it.
Imagine the scenes on the nightly news a few years hence, during a PSPS like the one this week, showing wealthy Californians sitting at home sipping wine as poor Californians with disabilities huddle in civic centers and medical facilities powered by diesel generators. Or imagine a fire comes during a PSPS, as has already happened this week, and gated communities evacuate via a well-lit procession of fully charged Teslas as poor communities scramble in the dark.
Distributed energy is coming to those who can afford it. If California doesnâ€™t get its shit together, it is at risk of stumbling into a safety and equity nightmare.
It needs to take charge of the shift to distributed energy, to make sure that itâ€™s done fairly and equitably and that all Californians capture a share of the benefits.
Helping DERs succeed will require a bunch of small things and one big thing
Itâ€™s a perilous time for distributed energy. The federal solar investment tax credit (ITC), currently at 30 percent, is set to phase out over the next several years. Net metering is coming under attack from all sides; almost everyone agrees current programs arenâ€™t sustainable, but no one can agree on what to replace them with.
Now would be a good time for California to make a serious plan.
There are microgrids operating in the state, with lots of fascinating and inspiring individual stories. I particularly recommend checking out the Stone Edge Farm Microgrid, which has multiple forms of energy generation and storage, and it is almost entirely self-sustaining. It stayed up and running for a few days even when its owners had to evacuate ahead of a fire! It offers guided tours, if youâ€™re ever in Sonoma.
But the problem is that almost all of the stateâ€™s microgrids are one-offs and demonstration projects funded by state R&D grants. While individual solar+storage systems are getting more common and more competitive, it remains unduly difficult to finance and implement community microgrid systems.
And front-of-the-meter distributed energy, despite its enormous potential to reduce the need for grid infrastructure, also remains difficult to interconnect to the grid.
There are some positive steps happening; the California Energy Commission has invested over $100 million in microgrid projects and the CPUC is shifting $100 million in state money to prioritize energy storage in fire-prone areas. But itâ€™s clear the state needs to do much more.
If youâ€™re looking for policy recommendations on how California can encourage DERs, there are plenty. Clean Coalition has some here. The solar power provider Sunrun has some here, in comments it submitted to the CPUC on how DERs can be used to ameliorate PSPS events. The California Solar and Storage Association lays out some hyper-specific, wonky reforms.
Some common suggestions include simpler and more open-access grid-interconnection standards, more transparent common standards for estimating the value of DERsâ€™ various benefits, more participation for DERs in utility solicitations, and better mechanisms for compensating DER owners for power, like feed-in tariffs
Also, everyone wants to boost funding for Californiaâ€™s Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), which is currently authorized to spend $830 million on DERs over the next five years (75 percent of it on behind-the-meter storage). The funding will be targeted at the most vulnerable areas, but it is nowhere near commensurate with the scale of the crisis.
Finally, maybe utilities could start financing solar+storage systems rather than handing out diesel generators.
But all of these reforms, it seems to me, nibble around the edges. What California communities need is a partner in planning their distribution systems around their varying goals: resilience, clean energy, integration of EVs, smart land use, and so on. Right now, they have no such partner, because their power utilities are not structured to play that role.
Instead, utilities are still operating with a 20th-century hangover, a model that forces them to prefer big investments in big grid infrastructure. As long as utilities are operating under that model, they will use their influence to slow the transition to distributed energy.
Whatâ€™s needed is root-and-branch reform of the way utilities like PG&E operate, a new model that makes them partners in the push for a bottom-up grid focused on local resilience. That is a level of ambition not yet seen in the restructuring plans before the bankruptcy court or in any of the plans being discussed by state lawmakers.
In my next post â€” my final in this series, I promise! â€” I will address that topic squarely: a new model for PG&E and other utilities that can better serve the social, environmental, and economic needs of California communities."
"On Sunday, November 3, at 2 am, weâ€™ll turn our clocks back one hour, heralding the end of daylight saving time for much of the country.
The biggest consequence: The change shifts daylight back into the morning hours. For 9-to-5 office workers, it means saying goodbye to leaving work while itâ€™s still light out. And for weekend workers, it means an additional glorious hour of sleep on Sunday. Hurrah!
Yet thereâ€™s still a lot of confusion about daylight saving time. The first thing to know: Yes, it ends in the fall, just as the decrease in daylight hours is becoming noticeable.
Letâ€™s sort it all out.
1) Why do we need to â€œsaveâ€ daylight hours in the summer?
Daylight saving time in the US started as an energy conservation trick during World War I and became a national standard in the 1960s.
The idea is that in the summer months, we shift the number of daylight hours we get into the evening. So if the sun sets at 8 pm instead of 7 pm, weâ€™d presumably spend less time with the lights on in our homes at night, saving electricity.
It also means that youâ€™re less likely to sleep through daylight hours in the morning (since those are shifted an hour later too). Hence â€œsavingâ€ daylight hours for the most productive time of the day.
Overall: We agree, the name is kind of confusing.
2) Isnâ€™t it â€œdaylight savings timeâ€ not â€œdaylight saving timeâ€?
No, itâ€™s definitely called â€œdaylight saving time.â€ Not plural. Be sure to point out this common mistake to friends and acquaintances. Youâ€™ll be really popular.
3) Does it actually lead to energy savings?
As Joseph Stromberg outlined in an excellent 2015 Vox article, the actual electricity conservation from the time change is unclear or nonexistent:
Despite the fact that daylight saving time was introduced to save fuel, there isnâ€™t strong evidence that the current system actually reduces energy use â€” or that making it year-round would do so, either. Studies that evaluate the energy impact of DST are mixed. It seems to reduce lighting use (and thus electricity consumption) slightly but may increase heating and AC use, as well as gas consumption. Itâ€™s probably fair to say that energy-wise, itâ€™s a wash.
4) Why doesnâ€™t Arizona or Hawaii change its clocks?
Arizona has a simple way to deal with daylight saving time: Most of the state ignores it.
Fifty years ago, the state legislature opted to keep the clocks in most of the state in standard time all year. One reason: Arizona summers are very hot, and an earlier sunset gives residents more time to enjoy tolerable temperatures before bed, as AZcentral explains. (Whatâ€™s confusing: The Navajo Nation in Arizona does use DST.)
Hawaii also doesnâ€™t observe DST. The island state is the farthest south of all states and rejected it because it doesnâ€™t see a hugely noticeable daylight hour difference between winter and summer months.
5) Didnâ€™t a bunch of states pass laws making daylight saving time permanent? What happened with those?
If youâ€™re a bit confused about which states follow daylight saving time and which do not, I donâ€™t blame you. Thatâ€™s because lately, a few states have looked into joining Arizona and Hawaii, but with a twist: They want daylight saving time to be in place all year long.
In the November 2018 election, Californians voted in favor of a ballot measure that paves the way for this. The measure, which passed with 60 percent of the vote, simply grants the California Legislature the power to vote to change the clocks permanently. Any changes would need to start with a two-thirds majority vote in the state legislature â€” which hasnâ€™t happened yet.
And even then, the time change wouldnâ€™t be a given. The federal government would have to approve it; that has uncertain prospects too.
In 2018, the Florida government approved the delightfully named Sunshine Protection Act, which seeks to permanently leave Florida in daylight saving time. (Essentially, it would mean that Florida will be one hour ahead of the rest of the East Coast during the winter months.) Massachusetts has looked into a similar measure, too.
The bill is still waiting on approval from Congress before it can go into effect. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has put forth a few bills to push the approval forward, but they havenâ€™t moved at all.
Arkansas, too, passed a bill to make daylight saving time permanent, but it included the condition that the changes wouldnâ€™t go into effect until its bordering states changed their clocks permanently too. Other states that have approved legislation to enact year-long daylight saving time include Washington, Tennessee, Oregon, Nevada, and Alabama. But none of the changes can go into effect without approval from the federal government.
So for now, all these states will be changing their clocks on Sunday along with the rest of us. Sorry!
(It appears other countries are also interested in getting rid of DST, or keeping it in place forever: Some members of the European Parliament â€” the governing body of the European Union â€” want to abolish clock changes there too.)
6) What would happen if daylight saving time were abolished? Or if it were extended forever?
Itâ€™s worth thinking about what would happen if Congress abolished daylight saving time (or kept it going all year long).
How might our patterns change? Blogger and cartographer Andy Woodruff decided to visualize this with a great series of maps.
The goal of these maps is to show how abolishing daylight saving time, extending it all year, or going with the status quo changes the number of days we have â€œreasonableâ€ sunrise and sunset times.
Reasonable, as defined by Woodruff, is the sun rising at 7 am or earlier or setting after 5 pm (so one could, conceivably, spend some time in the sun before or after work).
This is what the map looks like under the status quo of twice-yearly clock shifts. A lot of people have unreasonable sunrise times (the dark spots) for much of the year:
Andy Woodruff
Hereâ€™s how things would change if daylight saving were abolished (that is, if we just stuck to the time set in the winter all year). Itâ€™s better, particularly on the sunrise end:
Andy Woodruff
And hereâ€™s what would happen if daylight saving were always in effect. The sunrise situation would actually be worse for most people. But many more people would enjoy after-work light â€” and thereâ€™s a strong argument to make that this after-work light is actually worth more. (More on that below.)
Andy Woodruff
(Note: The length of light we experience each day wouldnâ€™t actually change; thatâ€™s determined by the tilt of Earthâ€™s axis. But we would experience it in times more accommodating for our modern world. Be sure to check out the interactive version of these maps on Woodruffâ€™s website.)
In 2015, Stromberg made the compelling case that the daylight saving time shift into the evening should be extended year-round. Having more light later could benefit us in a surprising number of ways:
People engage in more leisure activities after work than beforehand, so weâ€™d likely do more physical activity over sedentary leisure activities. Relatedly, studies show that kids get more exercise when the sun is out later in the evening.
Stromberg also cites some evidence that robberies decrease when thereâ€™s more sun in the evening hours.
There could be economic gains, since people â€œtake short trips, and buy things after work â€” but not before â€” so a longer DST slightly increases sales,â€ he writes.
7) Is daylight saving time dangerous?
A bit. When we shift clocks forward one hour in the spring, many of us will lose that hour of sleep. In the days after daylight saving time starts, our biological clocks are a little bit off. Itâ€™s like the whole country has been given one hour of jet lag.
One hour of lost sleep sounds like a small change, but we humans are fragile, sensitive animals. Small disruptions in our sleep have been shown to alter basic indicators of our health and dull our mental edge.
And when our biological clocks are off, everything about us is out of sync. Our bodies run this tight schedule to try to keep up with our actions. Since we usually eat a meal after waking up, we produce the most insulin in the morning. Weâ€™re primed to metabolize breakfast before even taking a bite. Itâ€™s more efficient that way.
(Thereâ€™s some good research that finds taking over-the-counter melatonin helps reset our body clocks to a new time. Read more about that here.)
Being an hour off schedule means our bodies are not prepared for our actions at any time of the day.
One example: driving.
In 1999, researchers at Johns Hopkins and Stanford universities wanted to find out what happens on the road when millions of drivers have their sleep disrupted.
Analyzing 21 years of fatal car crash data from the US National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, they found a very small, but significant, increase in road deaths on the Monday after the clock shift in the spring: The number of deadly accidents jumped to an average of 83.5 on the â€œspring forwardâ€ Monday compared with an average of 78.2 on a typical Monday.
And it seems itâ€™s not just car accidents. Evidence has also mounted of an increase in incidences of workplace injuries and heart attacks in the days after we spring forward.
8) How can we abolish daylight saving time, or extend it year-round?
Thatâ€™s easy! Well, not really: All it would take is an act of Congress. But I wouldnâ€™t count on this happening any time soon."
"The news for President Donald Trump this week on the impeachment inquiry was grim.
Most significantly, a witness gave testimony to House committees that proved devastating to one of the White Houseâ€™s key arguments â€” confirming that Trump personally seemed to link withholding military aid for Ukraine with his demand that Ukraine investigate his political opponents.
That witness, Bill Taylor, was one of whatâ€™s rapidly becoming a parade of government officials who are testifying to the inquiry despite the White Houseâ€™s order not to. Thatâ€™s emblematic of a broader trend of Trumpâ€™s weakness and ineffectiveness in responding to the scandal. Republicans have struggled to effectively defend the president, and even Trump himself felt enough heat to drop his plan to hold the G7 conference at one of his properties.
Meanwhile, reports suggested that Rudy Giuliani is in serious jeopardy from a criminal investigation that has already resulted in the arrest of two of his associates. And two Washington, DC, judges ordered the administration to turn over documents that are relevant for the impeachment inquiry.
The latter of those rulings came down Friday afternoon, as Chief Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the Trump administration had to turn over grand jury material from the Mueller investigation to House Democrats, because â€” and this is the key part â€” the House is, in fact, conducting a legitimate impeachment inquiry.
This didnâ€™t just cap off a week of bad news for Trump, it also undercut one of Republicansâ€™ key talking points: their complaint that the inquiry isnâ€™t valid until the whole House votes on it.
Bill Taylor gave the most devastating testimony yet

By far the most important development of the week was Tuesdayâ€™s closed-door testimony by Bill Taylor, the top diplomat at the US embassy in Kyiv: It revealed important new information about what, exactly, happened between Trump and Ukraine.
To set the stage: Itâ€™s been well documented by now that Trump tried to push Ukraine to launch investigations designed to serve his political needs â€” one into the origins of the FBIâ€™s Russia investigation and one into Burisma (a gas company where Joe Bidenâ€™s son served on the board). Itâ€™s also been well documented that Trump officials linked this demand to something the Ukrainians wanted: a meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House.
But perhaps the biggest question at the heart of this scandal has been whether Trumpâ€™s decision to block about $400 million in congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine was tied to this pressure campaign as well. Thatâ€™s what many believe is the most appalling allegation, that Trump was threatening Ukraineâ€™s security by withholding assistance they needed for their continuing military conflict with Russia unless they helped him politically.
And Taylor gave the clearest testimony yet suggesting that this was indeed what happened. Though Democrats havenâ€™t released a transcript of his full testimony, in a detailed 15-page opening statement, Taylor said:
That another official told him Gordon Sondland, the Ambassador to the European Union (and a close Trump ally), told a Ukrainian official â€œthat the security assistance money would not come until President Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.â€
That when Taylor asked Sondland whether this was true, he said that it was. â€œAmbassador Sondland said â€˜everythingâ€™ was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance,â€ Taylor said. â€œHe said that President Trump wanted President Zelensky â€˜in a public boxâ€™ by making a public statement about ordering such investigations.â€
That later, Sondland told Taylor again that Trump â€œwas adamantâ€ that Zelensky make such a statement â€” but also that Trump said this wasnâ€™t a â€œquid pro quo.â€
That Sondland told Zelensky that, if Zelensky didnâ€™t â€œclear things upâ€ regarding the investigations in public, they would be at a â€œstalemate.â€ (Taylor says he understood â€œstalemateâ€ to mean that Trump would keep blocking the aid.)
Taylor added that Sondland â€œtried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman,â€ and â€œwhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something ... the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check.â€ All of this sounds exactly like a quid pro quo, despite Trumpâ€™s insistence that it isnâ€™t one. (Taylor also adds that the analogy â€œmade no senseâ€ because â€œthe Ukrainians did not â€˜oweâ€™ President Trump anything.â€)
All of this debunked Trumpâ€™s continued insistence that he didnâ€™t link the aid to his demand for investigations. Taylorâ€™s information suggests that, 1) yes he did, 2) the Ukrainians were told of it, and 3) it came from Trump personally. So his testimony makes the factual picture at the heart of the scandal look even worse for President Trump than it already did.
Officials kept coming in to testify â€” and John Bolton may soon join them

Taylorâ€™s appearance was part of a trend. Again and again, sitting government officials have turned up for these depositions in the impeachment inquiry â€” in stark defiance of the Trump administrationâ€™s instructions that they should not.
Indeed, it was just a few weeks ago that White House counsel Pat Cipollone announced the Trump administration would not â€œparticipateâ€ in what they called an unconstitutional impeachment inquiry. The move seemed like it could pose a problem to Democratsâ€™ investigation.
Except what ended up happening is that several government officials have just testified anyway. Theyâ€™ve done so in response to Democratic subpoenas, but loquacious opening statements like those of Taylor and former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch suggest theyâ€™re not exactly reluctant to talk.
And itâ€™s possible Democrats could soon land their most famous witness yet. CNNâ€™s Kylie Atwood and Veronica Stracqualursi reported Friday that former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who exited the administration on bad terms last month, has communicated with House committees through his lawyers about a potential deposition. Given his high-level White House access, his unimpeachable Republican credentials, and his falling-out with Trump, Boltonâ€™s testimony could be explosive.
If it happens, that is: late on Friday, a former Bolton aide filed suit asking the courts to clarify whether he must testify. Bolton is using the same lawyer as that aide, so the question of whether he appears may be decided by the courts in the end.
Republicans struggled to defend Trump

As the scandal has worsened, meanwhile, Republicans predisposed to defend Trump have looked increasingly at a loss for how to do so.
Apparently unable to straightforwardly defend what Trump did, the GOPâ€™s primary focus this week was on criticizing how House Democrats have been conducting the inquiry. They profess to be deeply troubled, for instance, by the fact that recent witness interviews have been conducted behind closed doors rather than in public.
This criticism comes off as phony for several reasons. For one, House Republicans have previously used closed-door depositions for several of their own investigations (for instance, investigations into the Benghazi attack and into the Justice Departmentâ€™s handling of the Russia investigation). The critics also often omit the fact that Republicans who are on the relevant committees are permitted to attend these closed-door depositions.
All this culminated in a stunt on Wednesday in which several fiercely pro-Trump House Republicans stormed the secure room in which Defense Department official Laura Cooper was scheduled to be deposed. It was a farcical move that involved ordering pizza and some Republicans bringing their cellphones into a room where such devices are banned. And in the end, it didnâ€™t matter; proceedings were delayed for a few hours, but Cooper then testified anyway. In any case, Democrats are expected to move to public hearings in the coming weeks, so this talking point may soon be abandoned.
In the Senate, meanwhile, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has come under pressure from Trump supporters for purportedly not doing enough to defend the president. His response was to draft a resolution condemning the Houseâ€™s handling of the impeachment inquiry so far. But similarly, his criticisms were based on process. â€œIâ€™m not here to tell you that Donald Trumpâ€™s done nothing wrong,â€ he said at a press conference Thursday.
Graham has indeed been somewhat hesitant to launch an all-out defense of Trump, which has led to much squirming on his part during this scandal. Just days ago, he said that if â€œTrump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing.â€ After Bill Taylor testified that he was told this was the case, Graham complained this was â€œhearsayâ€ and that this needed to be â€œtestedâ€ by questioning other witnesses. Other witnesses are expected to confirm Taylorâ€™s account next week, so weâ€™ll have to wait and see what Grahamâ€™s next excuse will be.
The Trump Administration has been losing court battles
Meanwhile, the US federal district court for the District of Columbia gave Democrats two assists in their impeachment inquiry. First, on Wednesday, Judge Christopher Cooper ruled that the State Department had to release various Ukraine-related records â€” particularly involving Rudy Giulianiâ€™s communications with State officials â€” within 30 days. Cooper did so in response to a lawsuit brought by the group American Oversight.
Then, on Friday afternoon, Chief Judge Beryl Howell sided with House Judiciary Committee Democrats in a separate suit. Howell ruled that the Justice Department has to hand over Mueller report materials that had been withheld due to grand jury secrecy â€” and she gave them a deadline of October 30 to do so.
â€œThe need for continued secrecy is minimal and thus easily outweighed by HJCâ€™s compelling need for the material,â€ Howell wrote. She added: â€œTipping the scale even further toward disclosure is the publicâ€™s interest in a diligent and thorough investigation into, and in a final determination about, potentially impeachable conduct by the President described in the Mueller Report.â€ (Recently, of course, Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry has focused more on Ukraine than on the Mueller investigation, but getting more material canâ€™t hurt.)
Howell also refuted another common Republican process criticism of the impeachment inquiry: their complaint that the full House hasnâ€™t held a vote to officially approve the inquiry. â€œA House resolution has never, in fact, been required to begin an impeachment inquiry,â€ she writes.
It looks like Rudy Giuliani is in trouble

Separately from the action unfolding in Congress, several news developments suggested that Trumpâ€™s lawyer Rudy Giuliani is in increasing legal jeopardy from an investigation that has already ensnared two of his associates in the Ukraine caper (Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman) for campaign finance violations.
We already knew that Giuliani was under scrutiny in this probe from the US Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Southern District of New York. But Politicoâ€™s Darren Samuelsohn reported Friday that â€œthe criminal division of the Justice Department in Washington has taken an interest in the former New York mayor, too, meaning an expansion of resources that indicates the politically sensitive probe into the presidentâ€™s personal attorney is both broader and moving at a faster pace than previously understood.â€ Unsurprisingly, CNN reported that Giuliani has recently been â€œapproaching defense attorneys for possible representation.â€
On Friday, then, the somewhat embarrassing news broke that Giuliani had accidentally left NBC Newsâ€™ Rich Schapiro a voicemail in which he is heard discussing business with someone whose identity is unclear. â€œThe problem is, we need some money,â€ Giuliani said on October 16, a few days after Parnas and Frumanâ€™s arrests. â€œWe need a few hundred thousand.â€ What he needs the money for isnâ€™t clear, though a legal defense or some new business endeavor are two possibilities.
Trump backed off the G7 Doral plan
Finally, this doesnâ€™t relate to the Ukraine issue, but one of President Trumpâ€™s most controversial moves last week was his announcement that he would host the 2020 G7 meeting at one of his own properties in Miami.
Democrats accused him of brazen corruption and Republicans once again struggled to defend it. And it even seemed possible that the impeachment inquiry could expand to cover this self-dealing as well.
So itâ€™s noteworthy that, on Saturday evening, two days after making the announcement, Trump backed down:
Itâ€™s a sign that the president has been feeling some heat from his Republican allies behind the scenes â€” and that he calculated that, for the moment, this move was simply too controversial to defend.

"Of all the great questions of American popular culture, â€œWhatâ€™s going on with Kanye West?â€ is truly one of the most immortal. At any given time, something is definitely going on with West â€” so much so that if you look away for just a moment, it can become impossible to catch up.
And over the past year, the story of Kanye West has gotten downright baroque. For months now, increasingly enigmatic headlines about West have flashed across the mainstream, disappearing as quickly as they came. Kanye Founds a Church! Kanye Founds Possibly a Cult? Kanye Killed it at Coachella! Kanye Hawks Church Merch at Coachella! Kanyeâ€™s New Album Announced for September! Kanyeâ€™s New Album Delayed! Kanye Something Something Something Involving Domes?
Here is what is going on with Kanye West right now â€” including the news about his latest album, the church/maybe cult, and the domes â€” and how it all fits together.
Whatâ€™s going on with the new album?
Westâ€™s new album, titled Jesus Is King, came out on Friday, October 25, after a series of delays. The day before, West premiered a half-hour long IMAX documentary of the same title.
The album was originally expected to debut on September 27, based on a tweeted announcement from Westâ€™s wife Kim Kardashian West. But September 27 came and went without an album drop (although Kardashian urged fans to â€œhave faithâ€). On October 24, West announced that fans could expect the new album to drop at midnight â€” but then tweeted that he still needed to finish a few last mixes. The album finally dropped a few hours later.
Jesus Is King is an emphatically Christian album, sampling gospel and bits of the Lordâ€™s Prayer throughout. Spirituality isnâ€™t a new theme for West, whoâ€™s been making Christian music since the days of his 2004 single â€œJesus Walks.â€ But he reportedly announced at a his listening party that from now on, spirituality will be his only true theme, and that heâ€™ll no longer be making secular music.
Westâ€™s abrupt shift toward pointedly religious work comes well into a thriving career in the mainstream. In that respect, heâ€™s following in the footsteps of other musical legends: Famously, Bob Dylan spent the years between 1979 and 1981 releasing Gospel albums and proclaiming himself a born-again Christian, although he later returned to Judaism. West, though, seems to be proceeding more in the spirit of Al Green, who left behind his R&B career in 1976 to become an ordained minister and found a church.
Kanye West isnâ€™t ordained. But he does seem to be founding some kind of quasi-church.

What is Sunday Service?
Since the beginning of 2019, West has spent each Sunday leading pop-up church services called Sunday Service (heâ€™s already applied for the trademark). Sunday Service is music-focused, featuring a choir singing gospel covers of various songs both by West and by others, and also includes occasional informal prayers. Itâ€™s the songs that have made Sunday Service a social media sensation; in clips posted online by attendees â€” mostly Kardashian â€” they sound, as Jia Tolentino put it at the New Yorker, â€œstartlingly beautiful.â€
Sunday Service began in an enclosed rehearsal space, then moved to a series of secret locations: secluded fields in Calabasas or Wyoming; the Adidas headquarters. At the beginning, the event was always invite-only, with NDAs required and celebrity guests galore â€” Courtney Love, Brad Pitt, Idris Elba, and Busy Phillips have all attended â€” but the public got to join this April when West brought Sunday Service to Coachella. And lately, West has been hosting Sunday Service open to the public at venues across the country, both sacred and secular.

A post shared by Courtney Love Cobain (@courtneylove) on Mar 10, 2019 at 1:14pm PDT
Sunday Service is nondenominational, but itâ€™s emphatically Christian. And insofar as it is â€œaboutâ€ anything, itâ€™s about celebrating the music of the black church. Even when there are prayers, itâ€™s the music thatâ€™s at the center of the service.
There is also something going on with domes???
West seems to be in the midst of a particularly utopian moment. Earlier this year, he built a trio of wooden domes on his property in Calabasas, based on the domes of Star Warsâ€™s Tatooine. The domes could, West told Forbes in July, be used as living spaces for the homeless. No details ever emerged explaining how exactly West planned to use his domes to generate affordable housing, but according to TMZ, he believed they had the potential to break down the barriers between classes.
(West also wanted a dome to perform in at Coachella. When festival organizers were unable to deliver, he pulled out of his scheduled gig as headliner and only agreed to show up to perform at all when given a hill to use for Sunday Service on Easter Sunday.)
Those domes in Calabasas, however, are no more. After Westâ€™s neighbors filed a series of noise complaints, a state inspector came by to see the construction and determined that it violated building code. TMZ confirmed that all of the domes were torn down in September, although the site speculates that itâ€™s possible West will return to the project on the new property in Wyoming he purchased this summer.
The domes arenâ€™t Westâ€™s only utopian project, anyway. Forbes reports that he is also hard at work on the future of sneakers: â€œa shoe made out of algae that will biodegrade completely over time in landfillsâ€”or almost immediately if sprayed with a certain type of bacteria,â€ according to the magazine.
Where is all this interest in religion and utopianism coming from?
Per Kardashian, West has â€œhad an amazing evolution of being born again and being saved by Christ,â€ and Sunday Service started as a way â€œjust to heal himself.â€ Since then, West has decided to open the service to friends and family, and then to the public. â€œIt started off healing for him, and now itâ€™s become something that he really wants to share for everyone else,â€ Kardashian said on The View in September.
What West is healing himself from is not clear, but the past few years have been fraught for him. In 2016, while on his Saint Pablo tour, West would routinely stop his concerts to deliver increasingly incendiary speeches to the crowd, at one time apparently suggesting that Jay-Z might assassinate him and another time saying that if he had voted, he would have voted for Donald Trump. Then he canceled his tour in the middle of a performance and was hospitalized for what was described at the time as a â€œpsychiatric emergency.â€
West continued to support Trump after Trump took office, donning the MAGA hat and taking meetings in the Oval Office. Just last year, he declared that he believed slavery was â€œa choiceâ€ and called for the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, to be abolished itself.

Kanye Westâ€™s confounding political evolution, explained
Westâ€™s Trump support was toxic for his brand. â€œThese are not stray thoughts,â€ wrote Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic last year after West met with Trump in the Oval Office. â€œThey are the propaganda that justifies voter suppression, and feeds police brutality, and minimizes the murder of Heather Heyer. And Kanye West is now a mouthpiece for it.â€
Around the same time that West was making headlines for his politics, he began speaking publicly about his mental health and struggles with addiction. He revealed that he suffered from an opioid addiction after getting liposuction in 2016. (Notably, Westâ€™s mother died after complications from liposuction and breast reduction surgery in 2007.) He announced that he had been diagnosed as bipolar and described it as his â€œsuperpower,â€ then said that he had been misdiagnosed and was only sleep deprived. (He has since said that he really is bipolar, although his treatment plan does not involve medication.)
Neither West nor Kardashian has said that West needed to â€œhealâ€ himself from any of what happened between 2016 and 2018 specifically. But what we know of Westâ€™s life in those years suggests that it was tempestuous at best. And Kardashian seems to be implying that Sunday Service and Westâ€™s new outlook on life are a direct reaction to that very tempest.
How does a church fit into the Kardashian-West family business?
The extended West-Kardashian-Jenner clan is no stranger to the church business. Kim Kardashianâ€™s mother Kris Jenner is the founder of the California Community Church, a venture that gossip blogs generally refer to as a â€œtax shelter,â€ where members are required to tithe either $1,000 per month or 10 percent of their annual income. Kim herself says she gives 10 percent, and itâ€™s one of the charities she routinely donates to.
Is Kanye West maybe starting a cult?
Probably not! But â€¦ itâ€™s not totally implausible.
â€œItâ€™s got the early trappings [of a cult], I guess we could say,â€ Janja Lalich, a cult expert and a sociology professor at California State University, Chico, told Vox over the phone.
To be clear, we are not saying that that there have been any reports of Sunday Service being dangerous or harmful. But whatâ€™s on the public record about Sunday Service and about Westâ€™s background includes a few details that Lalich says are cult red flags. Where it gets tricky is that most of those red flags are pretty normal things for a celebrity to do â€” they just get a lot more complicated once religion enters the picture.
To begin with, West has a history of playing with Jesus iconography, as in his 2013 album Yeezus (a portmanteau of Westâ€™s nickname, Ye, and Jesus) which included the song â€œI Am a God,â€ featuring God. (West says he wrote the song in an act of defiance after he got snubbed at Paris Fashion Week.) In 2006, he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone wearing a crown of thorns. One of his earliest and most admired singles was 2004â€™s â€œJesus Walks.â€
All of this behavior can be, and usually is, written off as standard hip-hop braggadocio. But Lalich says itâ€™s also a cult warning sign when the leader of a religious movement makes a habit of â€œassociating himself with higher religious figures and principles.â€ In other words, when the guy who keeps comparing himself to Jesus starts a church, itâ€™s not irrational for people to raise their eyebrows.
Secondly, thereâ€™s the exclusivity of the whole scene: all those A-list celebrities, the oft-cited NDA policy. Even as more public Sunday Services start to emerge, they remain star-studded events. Thatâ€™s a normal way for celebrities to build buzz around a new venture, by making it seem as cool and exclusive as possible. But Lalich says itâ€™s also one of the strategies that cult leaders use to draw people into their churches, via the implication that attending will set you up for the same kind of success that its existing members have attained. (See, for example, Scientology.)
Thirdly, thereâ€™s the merch issue. The Sunday Service choir wears a standard uniform of Westâ€™s Yeezy clothing line in what appears to be a straightforward advertisement, and fans can purchase â€œchurch clothesâ€ from Westâ€™s website: $50 socks that say â€œJesus Walks,â€ and $225 hoodies that say â€œHoly Spirit.â€
Again, itâ€™s very normal for a celebrity to sell merch and monetize their brand. But when a religious leader does it, and also explicitly marks spending money on their merchandise as an act of religious faith, things get a little more worrisome. As Lalich points out, â€œPeople beginning to dress a certain way, having a certain look associated with themâ€ â€” and having to give money to the leader of their movement in order to do so â€” is one of the earliest signs of a cult.
And finally, Sunday Service isnâ€™t associated with any particular Christian denomination. That means West isnâ€™t responsible to anyone besides himself if something goes wrong within his fledgling organization or if anyone happens to abuse their power. In â€œlegitimate churches,â€ says Lalich, â€œyou have a place to complain to. But these smaller churches that sometimes get very big donâ€™t have any kind of mechanism to hold the leaders accountable.â€
None of these red flags mean that West is starting a cult. â€œIt could just be a passing fancy,â€ says Lalich. â€œIt depends on how much people get truly involved and how much he takes advantage.â€
So what would it take to be sure that Sunday Service is definitely a cult? Basically, weâ€™d need to know that West or someone else who is high up in Sunday Service is actively taking control of their followersâ€™ lives, and that followers have begun policing one another in ways they donâ€™t do in legitimate churches.
â€œIf youâ€™re a Catholic, youâ€™re not supposed to use contraception. But nobodyâ€™s going into your bedroom to see if youâ€™re using contraception, right?â€ says Lalich. â€œWhen things are unhealthy, thereâ€™s a lot more of people telling on each other, spying on each other, reporting on each other, that make it like youâ€™re no longer really a free individual.â€
Thereâ€™s no reason to think that Kanye West plans to incorporate the surveillance and control that characterizes a true cult into his Sunday Service. But intentionally or not, the way heâ€™s built the movement so far means it has the potential to develop in that direction.
Regardless, West appears to be committed to Sunday Service â€” and to Christianity in general â€” for the foreseeable future. What remains to be seen is if the whole dome thing is going to last, too.

"A story published on Monday by Sports Illustrated details how Houston Astros executive Brandon Taubman allegedly taunted a group of female reporters, including one wearing a domestic violence-awareness bracelet, over a domestic violence incident following the teamâ€™s American League Championship Series-clinching win on Saturday night. But if the story itself wasnâ€™t damning enough, the baseball teamâ€™s response to it made things worse. (The team announced Thursday that Taubman has been fired.)
The SI piece, authored by Stephanie Apstein, begins with this anecdote from a celebratory scene in the Astros locker room in which players, including Roberto Osuna, were smoking cigars and drinking cocktails:
[I]n the center of the room, assistant general manager Brandon Taubman turned to a group of three female reporters, including one wearing a purple domestic-violence awareness bracelet, and yelled, half a dozen times, â€œThank God we got Osuna! Iâ€™m so f------ glad we got Osuna!â€
The outburst was offensive and frightening enough that another Houston staffer apologized. The Astros declined to comment. They also declined to make Taubman available for an interview.
The Osuna in question is Astros relief pitcher Roberto Osuna. Given the context â€” a celebratory scene in a locker room following a victory â€” you might think that Osuna played a key role in the win. But the opposite was the case. Osuna gave up a game-tying two-run home run in the top of the 9th inning, but the Astros salvaged the game by hitting a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 9th. So based on how things unfolded, the timing of Taubmanâ€™s profane celebration of Osuna was exceedingly odd.
In fact, the reason Taubman was so amped about Osuna during that specific moment of time appears to have been a very unsavory one: Osuna has a history of domestic violence that the female reporter wearing the DV-awareness bracelet (she has asked reporters to keep her name out of the story) has repeatedly highlighted since the Astros acquired him in a trade in July of last year.
Hereâ€™s the backstory: Two months before the Astros traded for him, Osuna â€” then a member of the Toronto Blue Jays â€” was arrested by Toronto police for assaulting the mother of his 3-year-old son. Osunaâ€™s alleged victim ultimately refused to testify against him, and in September of last year charges were dropped in exchange for the equivalent of a restraining order. That agreement came shortly after Osuna completed a 75-game suspension that Major League Baseball imposed upon him without pay.
Trading for Osuna under those circumstances was a bad look for the Astros. Other teams refused to have anything to do with him, and numerous Astros players had gone on the record to condemn domestic violence and denounce players who had been involved in previous DV incidents. The organization tried to atone by, among other efforts, donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to domestic violence shelters. Still, the perception the move created was that the organization was interested in winning baseball games above and beyond all else. And Taubmanâ€™s locker room outburst suggested that he, at least, continues to hold a grudge about reporters holding the Astros accountable for their decision to acquire Osuna.
SIâ€™s report indicated that, for at least one (former) high-ranking member of the Astrosâ€™ front office, Osunaâ€™s domestic violence incident in particular and DV in general arenâ€™t being taken nearly as seriously as they should be. Not only did Taubman seemingly rub domestic violence in female reportersâ€™ faces, but he went far out of his way to do so: Nobody was talking about it until he made it an issue. But the Astrosâ€™ response to Apsteinâ€™s story made a bad situation worse.
The Astros used the incident to attack the reporter who wrote about it, then quickly walked it back
Instead of apologizing for Taubmanâ€™s behavior, the organization on Monday night released a statement attacking Apsteinâ€™s reporting â€” which was corroborated by multiple witnesses â€” as â€œmisleading and completely irresponsible.â€
Taubmanâ€™s comments â€œhad everything to do about the game situation that just occurred and nothing else â€” they also were not directed toward any specific reporter,â€ the statement released on behalf of the organization said. â€œWe are extremely disappointed in Sports Illustratedâ€™s attempt to fabricate a story where one does not exist.â€
As youâ€™d expect, that statement did not go over well. So on Tuesday â€” right around the same time MLB announced it will conduct its own investigation of the situation â€” the team released new statements from Taubman and owner Jim Crane. While striking a much more remorseful tone, they also served as a tacit admission that the teamâ€™s initial statement was, at best, misleading. The organization suddenly apologized for an incident that they initially dismissed as a fabrication and acknowledged â€” albeit obliquely â€” the connection between the outburst and Osunaâ€™s history of domestic assault.
In the new statement, Taubman apologized for using â€œinappropriate language,â€ not directly for making light of domestic violence, although he did acknowledge that â€œ[m]y overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue.â€ Crane, for his part, insisted that the Astros â€œcontinue to be committed to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence.â€ (Domestic violence is a major problem in baseball. Six players have been suspended for it since last July, which is more than in the two previous years combined.)
Still, no less an authority than one of the most prominent baseball reporters in the world, Buster Olney of ESPN, noted that the Astrosâ€™ new set of statements fell far short of a blanket apology for initially responding to reporting about the locker room incident by attacking the journalist who wrote about it.
On Tuesday evening â€” right around the same time the first game of the World Series between the Astros and Washington Nationals began â€” NPRâ€™s David Folkenflik published a follow-up piece that made it clearer than ever that Taubmanâ€™s outburst was meant to spite the female reporter wearing a DV-awareness bracelet.
According to three eyewitnesses interviewed by NPR, Taubman appeared to be responding to the presence of a female reporter who was wearing a purple rubber bracelet to heighten awareness about domestic violence.
That reporter has tweeted repeatedly about the issue over the years. Taubman complained last year that some of the reporterâ€™s informational tweets â€” promoting domestic violence hotline telephone numbers, for example â€” appeared moments after Osuna entered several Astros games in relief.
On Thursday, the Astros released a statement announcing that following an investigation, Taubman has been fired. It adds that team officials â€œwere wrongâ€ in initially believing that Taubmanâ€™s outburst was â€œnot directed toward any reporter.â€
The frame of Apsteinâ€™s Sports Illustrated piece is about how Taubmanâ€™s outburst â€œillustrates MLBâ€™s forgive-and-forget attitude toward domestic violence.â€ Fittingly, by Thursday, the baseball world had largely moved on to talking about the Astrosâ€™ Games 1 and 2 losses to the Nationals â€” at least until the team announced that it was taking action.

"Amazon skeptics have long repeated a narrative about the e-commerce behemoth now worth $880 billion: that it doesnâ€™t make money, that its razor-thin margins meant to crush competitors are unsustainable, and that its business model will surely, eventually, fail.
And pretty much every financial quarter, I make the same chart for Amazonâ€™s quarterly earnings that seems to reflect this narrative. It compares Amazonâ€™s revenue (gray line) â€” seasonal peaks and valleys that go up and to the right to the tune of nearly $70 billion last quarter â€” to profit (pink line), a much more modest line that reflects a small percentage (3 percent last quarter but historically much less) of those sales. It shows relatively low profits on gargantuan sales.
But the idea that Amazonâ€™s relatively low profits mean itâ€™s failing at business is not strictly true â€” at least not anymore.
In fact, as my colleague Jason Del Rey reports in an episode of Land of the Giants, his podcast about the rise of Amazon, these small profit margins are one of the secrets to the companyâ€™s success.
Amazon intentionally posts low profits because it takes the vast majority of the money it earns and invests it right back into the company so that it will profit all the more in the future. Its business model, once reviled on Wall Street, has spurred numerous other companies like Uber and WeWork to emulate Amazon and forgo profits for the sake of growth â€” though many of these companies havenâ€™t really proved that they could ever be profitable.
A short explanation
When I make the same chart every quarter that shows seemingly lackluster profits, I generally get the same responses every quarter from readers.
Amazon is failing.
Amazon is winning.
You forgot free cash flow; thatâ€™s much more important than revenue and profit.
Hereâ€™s what that all means:
Think of revenue as Amazonâ€™s cut of third-party sales or the total of your Amazon shopping cart, if youâ€™re purchasing Amazon products. This includes sales of products and services, including when Amazon ships goods for third parties. Amazon collects that money but doesnâ€™t keep most of it.
Profit is how much of those total sales in a given quarter Amazon actually gets to keep, after it accounts for the cost of selling those items: the items themselves, shipping, package thefts, marketing, keeping the lights on. Profit is calculated assuming that everything is purchased and paid for in that one quarter.
Free cash flow (yellow line) is a bit like profit, except it doesnâ€™t assume that Amazon has to pay for everything in the same time frame it sells it. And thanks to how Amazonâ€™s payment cycle works, it usually gets money for selling an item long before it has to pay for that item. For example, it takes Walmart on average nearly three days to receive payment for goods after it paid its suppliers, while Amazon on average receives payment about 18 days before it paid its suppliers, according to the latest available cash conversion cycle data from the financial research platform Sentieo.
Amazonâ€™s sales are also growing, meaning itâ€™s not in danger of reversing the free cash flow trend, which has generally been growing thanks to margins that have risen faster than capital expenditures. It has even more money coming in before the money for last quarterâ€™s bills is due. Therefore, its money on hand, or â€œfree cash flow,â€ is always higher than its profits.
Itâ€™s important to note that Amazonâ€™s profit margins arenâ€™t actually that low, depending on what kind of company you consider Amazon. Among most retailers, single-digit margins are perfectly normal. And thanks to Amazonâ€™s other, higher-margin businesses â€” advertising and its Amazon Web Services cloud computing services â€” those margins are ticking higher.
â€œYou could take Snap, Twitter, and Pinterest and combine their revenue and that would be less than the free cash flow Amazon is generatingâ€
Amazonâ€™s free cash flow is also incredibly high.
â€œIts free cash flow is higher than most of the revenue youâ€™re seeing in many tech companies,â€ managing director at RBC Capital Markets Mark Mahaney told Recode. â€œYou could take Snap, Twitter, and Pinterest and combine their revenue and that would be less than the free cash flow Amazon is generating.â€
Free cash flow is an important metric for Amazon â€” the companyâ€™s CEO, Jeff Bezos, has called it Amazonâ€™s â€œultimate financial measureâ€ â€” for a couple of reasons.
For one, people commonly determine a stockâ€™s value based on its future cash flow, so it directly relates to how much a stock should cost. Many investors also think itâ€™s a better gauge than profit of a companyâ€™s health.
Perhaps most importantly: money talks. Amazonâ€™s access to cash enables it to do everything from paying its employees, suppliers, and shareholders to investing in its future.
And while investing in its future lowers its profits, it also lowers its taxes by creating less taxable income.
Investing
Amazon keeps profit and free cash flows artificially low by investing money right back into its business in the form of capital expenses, like building data centers, upgrading distribution networks, and creating wind and solar farms. It can do so without having to borrow money, which means it wonâ€™t incur interest costs. (Note that in addition to its strict tech investments like data centers and hardware plants, Amazon has to build out physical warehouses where it stores, sorts, packages, and ships goods from hundreds of thousands of sellers.)
All these investments have led to lines of businesses like AWS cloud computing and advertising that are relatively much more profitable than its e-commerce segment.
â€œTheyâ€™re going to barely be profitable, but theyâ€™re going to reinvest their profits rapidly into new innovative products â€” and then you see them go from books to music to jewelry to toys to private label to AWS to Alexa to advertising on the platform to acquiring Zappos to acquiring Twitch to acquiring Ring,â€ venture capitalist and trend forecaster Mary Meeker told Del Rey on Land of the Giants.
â€œYou go, â€˜Okay, so I see the growth. I see the lifetime value of the customers rising,â€™â€ she said, explaining how investors began to justify Amazonâ€™s costly investments.
Amazon had a record $24 billion in capital spending last year, nearly as much as Google parent company Alphabet, which last year brought in $30 billion in profits on $136 billion in revenue, a profit margin of 22 percent.
Investing in itself has been a core tenet of Amazonâ€™s business, and it doesnâ€™t show signs of flagging. The company has held fast to its â€œItâ€™s always Day Oneâ€ mantra, a mindset Del Rey has reported on in depth.
â€œThe day Amazon makes an announcement that its margins are rising because it canâ€™t find new areas to invest in and itâ€™s going to return it to shareholders, growth investors are not going to be interested anymore,â€ Mahaney said.
â€œPeople like [Amazon] because [it has] invested in or created or established new industries. People keep expecting [Amazon] to do so because it has a track record of doing it.â€
Taxes
Amazonâ€™s internal investments also keep its tax bill down, saving the company money.
While we donâ€™t know exactly what Amazon pays in taxes, various estimates suggest its rate is low thanks in part to its huge investments in its business. What we do know is that its taxes have provided plenty of fodder for presidential candidates like Joe Biden, whoâ€™s mentioned it on his campaign and on Twitter, and Elizabeth Warren, who included the company as an example in her new corporate tax proposal. President Donald Trump has also harangued the company for not paying enough in taxes.
Amazon has responded that itâ€™s simply paying what the government says it owes.
When Amazon upgrades its warehouses or builds new data centers or solar farms, it can immediately deduct that amount, which reduces its taxable income â€” and, by extension, its tax bill.
As Amazon told the Wall Street Journal last year, â€œBecause we are in a low-margin industry and invest in innovation and infrastructure, we donâ€™t make as much pretax profit as other tech companies, so our taxes are lower.â€
While low profits havenâ€™t always been something Wall Street has tolerated, they actually form a key element of Amazonâ€™s success. In a way, its low profits are making it more profitable.
They have enabled Bezos to become the richest man in the world at the helm of one of the worldâ€™s most valuable companies. And as Amazon has kept its profits low and its investments expansive, it has changed not only the way we purchase books and clothing, but also how we communicate with our devices and how the internet operates â€” and its growth is far from over."
"Despite glowing reviews from critics, HBOâ€™s adaptation of Watchmen is proving to be divisive among some comic book fans. Itâ€™s not the acting or cinematography of the TV drama follow-up to the influential superhero story that they have a problem with. Instead, some disdainful viewers are outraged that showrunner Damon Lindelofâ€™s Watchmen is too â€œpolitical,â€ too entrenched in â€œidentity politicsâ€ â€” too â€œSJWâ€ (â€œsocial justice warriorâ€) â€” in ways that they think writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbonsâ€™s original comic wasnâ€™t.
Watchmen currently has a 46 percent audience approval score on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to its 96 percent critic approval rating. On Metacritic, it has a 6.8 positive audience score, with 35 negative reviews. In contrast, not one professional outlet listed on Metacritic gave the show an outright negative review.
The same is true on social media, where some fans have been talking about how they find the new Watchmen far more political than the one they grew up with.
But the story here isnâ€™t about how critics and audiences perceive quality differently â€” enjoyment, after all, is subjective. Rather, viewers who bash the HBO show for being too political seem to ignore that the source material itself was a politically charged text, and that Moore was deliberately admonishing American power politics. But in Damon Lindelofâ€™s Watchmen, those scathing criticisms that Moore embedded into the comic series become impossible to ignore.
Watchmen was created as a cautionary tale of extreme right-wing politics, but hasnâ€™t always been interpreted that way
Watchmen is a superhero story, and decades of superhero stories have trained their captive audiences to identify with the hero, root against the villain, and celebrate when the hero saves the day.
But Watchmen is not a typical superhero story. Almost none of the superheroes in the story have powers. Theyâ€™re just regular humans, flaws and all, who have taken it upon themselves to be the heroes their community needs, and believe themselves to have more of a say than regular people about what is good and isnâ€™t good for humanity. What was unique about Watchmen when it debuted in 1986 was that it was fully cognizant of how American politics would set the rules for superheroes, if they existed in the real world.
By setting the dystopian fantasy in an alternate version of 1986 America, one in which President Nixon was still in charge, Gibbons and Moore downplayed the political messages at the storyâ€™s core â€” distrust of authority; critiques of an objectivist, right-wing moral code; skepticism of government â€œheroesâ€ like Ronald Reagan â€” with Gibbons often arguing that the book is open to many interpretations, including political ones.
â€œIâ€™ve now come around to thinking that the twelve issues of Watchmen are actually less like a Rorschach test for the reader and more akin to ... a blizzard of words and pictures much like the seething broadcast information from which Ozymandias himself attempts to distill meaning,â€ he wrote in the 2017 annotated version of Watchmen, explaining how heâ€™s come to see the book as less open to interpretation and more a flurry of messages for the reader to unpack at their will.
Moore even purposely set Watchmen in an alternate timeline, because he was afraid that people might be too hung up its politics.
â€œI also wanted to write about power politics,â€ Moore told Entertainment Weekly in 2005 of the creation of Watchmen. â€œRonald Reagan was president. But I worried readers might switch off if they thought I was attacking someone they admired. So we set Watchmen in a world where Nixon was in his fourth term because youâ€™re not going to get much argument that Nixon was scum!â€
Moore has been pretty explicit about the real-life political critiques he was mashing into the bones of his book: Moore was not a fan of President Ronald Reaganâ€™s and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherâ€™s conservative politics and policies at the time, and those feelings are apparent to keen readers.

In 1986, Watchmen skewered the way we love superheroes. Itâ€™s still as relevant as ever.
Rorschach is the avatar of Watchmenâ€™s politics. Not everyone can see that.
At the heart of the political reading of Watchmen is the bookâ€™s most misinterpreted character: Rorschach, a vigilante who both stands up for the truth and acts violently against those whose beliefs he abhorred.
While Rorschach, in the book, nobly abstains from the other former superheroesâ€™ plan to cover up villain Ozymandiasâ€™s dastardly deed â€” killing millions of innocent people to avoid a nuclear war â€” his moral code is pretty repugnant. He constantly breaks the law, because he thinks himself above the law. He also has a very black-and-white view of justice, preferring to take matters into his own hands (which usually results in violence). And in his journal entries, heâ€™s paranoid, nihilistic, and sees the worst in people â€” usually the poor, immigrants, and women.
Moore has said Rorschach is an homage of sorts to the comics artist Steve Ditko and his right-wing ideologies, drawn from writer Ayn Randâ€™s polarizing theory of objectivism that Moore vehemently disagreed with; Moore called Rand a white supremacist with burnt ideas.
Moore, who identifies as an anarchist, has said in interviews that he wanted to show how this black-and-white idea of good and bad and strict moral conservative code would work in a superhero world with real consequences. Rorschachâ€™s superficial notions of good and evil are a lot easier to convey in a comic book narrative in which the stakes are heightened. (Think of Thanos snapping half of the population away in Avengers: Infinity War).
To Rorschach, people always have the ability to be good. If they arenâ€™t good, by his standards, itâ€™s their own fault for not achieving his benchmarks. Despite calling himself a hero, he has no will to help those who fall on the wrong side of goodness â€” he sees them as oxygen thieves of society.
Gibbons/DC
Rorschachâ€™s rigid standards have won him adulation over the years, despite Moore and Gibbonsâ€™ goal otherwise. In 2015, headed into the fight to become the Republican presidential nominee, Sen, Ted Cruz said one of his favorite superheroes of all time was Watchmenâ€™s Rorschach, which spurred several think pieces defending the characterâ€™s heroism â€” not unlike those about whether director Zack Snyderâ€™s respectful portrayal of Rorschach as a hero in his 2009 film adaptation of the story was appropriate. And every so often, there are extensive Reddit debates and Quora queries about Rorschachâ€™s heroism.
â€œHeâ€™s willing to risk his life and die for that belief,â€ Jim Geraghty wrote for the National Review in 2015, praising the character. â€œSure, Rorschach is a violent, emotionally-damaged, obsessive vigilante, but all of the characters in this story are pretty deeply flawed.â€
In an interview with Comic Book Artist magazine from 2000, Moore speculated as to what could lead to the misinterpretation of Rorschach: People who clearly see Rorschach as an empathetic hero, he said, are â€œpeople who might secretly believe themselves to be part of the elite and not part of the excluded majority.â€
In a regular world where no one is super-powered, Rorschach becomes more of a monster. His thoughts on the uselessness of women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and those who are disabled or mentally ill are more clearly disturbing: He isnâ€™t any better than the world around him, yet considers himself superior and conducts his â€œsuperheroismâ€ in the same fashion.
In Mooreâ€™s view, readers who donâ€™t see Rorschachâ€™s worldview as nihilistic and reprehensible are often like Rorschach himself: unable to see the problem with believing in such rigid, self-interested moral codes.
They see society as Rorschach does; everything is a me vs. them situation. Buying into this sort of victimhood is a toxic way to read a toxic character â€” not only does it allow readers to ignore the conservative political implications of Rorschachâ€™s beliefs, but it leads them to pump up an undeserving star.
HBO and Damon Lindelof made Watchmen more explicit by focusing on race
The disconnect between how Watchmenâ€™s creators thought of Rorschach and how some fans have perceived him â€” a self-interested nihilist vs. an inspirational thought leader â€” brings up the timeless topic of an artistâ€™s intent versus their audienceâ€™s interpretations.
But based on this renewed defensiveness from Watchmen fans about the alleged lack of politics in the original text as compared to the HBO show, perhaps Moore has proved his point. He has said that the people who scared him most were Americans, during the time of Reagan, who believed themselves to be invincible.
â€œMy personal feelings, because Iâ€™m the writer and can do anything that I want, is that at the moment a certain part of Reaganâ€™s America isnâ€™t scared,â€ Moore told the Comics Journal in 1987. â€œThey think theyâ€™re invulnerable. Thereâ€™s this incredible up mood that leads at its worst excesses to things like the Libyan bombing and things like that, and they worry me and frighten me.â€
What the team behind HBOâ€™s Watchmen has done to make sure its viewers are appropriately â€œscaredâ€ is to be more explicit in illustrating the dangers of political and social elitism, by using much closer-to-home examples. HBOâ€™s Watchmen makes the political underpinnings of the text overt from the beginning, referencing Americaâ€™s history of racial turmoil to set the groundwork for the storyâ€™s related present-day concerns.

HBOâ€™s Watchmen tells stories about Americaâ€™s racist past in Americaâ€™s racist present
The show opens with the Tulsa, Oklahoma, massacre of 1921, an event in which white mobs burned down a black community and killed hundreds of black residents in the process â€” a response to black World War I veterans trying to prevent a lynching. In the aftermath of the attacks, Oklahomaâ€™s governor declared martial law and called in the National Guard. It arrested all surviving black residents who werenâ€™t already imprisoned, jailing them for as long as eight days.
People with power putting themselves above the law and inflicting their brand of â€œjusticeâ€ has punctuated Americaâ€™s history. And as was the case during the riots in Tulsa, and others like them in Chicago, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, the people who are in power has always been directly tied to race.
Watchmen on HBO makes that a key theme more obviously than the comic does. Perhaps the showâ€™s boldest move to fans of the character could be that Rorschach, who has long since died, is now deemed a white supremacist, and his followers domestic terrorists; he helps illustrate the ties of race and power. And while the Watchmen television show seems to operate within the same alternate history as the original comic, these elements of white supremacy, domestic terrorism, and police brutality are all currently topics of national conversation. Their modern relevance helps to close the distance between reality and fiction that the graphic novel made more of an effort to keep apart.
In Moore and Gibbonsâ€™ version of Watchmen, giving someone unrestrained authority is a recipe for disaster. Lindelof pushes that question further and glances into American history to draw on that same theme, but from the point of view of black men and women â€” people who have been ostracized, belittled, dehumanized. People who someone like Rorschach would have loathed.
Through this lens, itâ€™s both harder and more uncomfortable to ignore abuses of power. Watchmen on HBO makes it clear who holds that power in Americaâ€™s history (traditionally white men), and for viewers who share these scionsâ€™ skin color and gender, the impact of racial supremacy on this superhero society can be a painful truth to contend with. The Watchmen TV show relentlessly emphasizes that white peopleâ€™s abuse of power has shaped the lives of everyone around them, particularly those who are not white and powerful.
What bears repeating is that Lindelofâ€™s adaptation might be a bit more difficult and uncomfortable, but itâ€™s essentially telling the same story of power politics that Moore was. Itâ€™s just that in 2019, Watchmenâ€™s alternate America isnâ€™t quite as far away from our own."
"Democrats condemned President Donald Trump this week for using the word â€œlynchingâ€ to describe his impeachment. Republicans responded with a counterattack: Joe Biden said the same thing 20 years ago as a senator, and Virginiaâ€™s lieutenant governor used the term in February of this year.
In a media storm launched from a Trump tweet (again), the argument from some conservatives regarding the word â€œlynchingâ€ was not that using the term was good, but that Democrats had been just as willing to use the term before Trump took office, and even since, indicating that the ire caused by Trumpâ€™s tweet was mostly for show.
The defense was made by conservative commentators like Mark Levin, who said earlier this week, â€œThis is a pseudo-event â€” a non-event â€” which the Democrats and the media and the media and the Democrats, once and the same, are using yet again to attack the president of the United States and try and drive down his popularity, to try and create a caricature of the man, that heâ€™s a racist. When in fact that word has been used and was used repeatedly during the Clinton impeachment period.â€
Since Trump descended an escalator and launched his presidential campaign with a broadside against Mexican immigrants, Democrats and liberals have made race, racism, and Trumpâ€™s attitudes toward both a central pillar of their criticism of not only his administration, but of the president himself.
But many conservatives and Republicans believe that thatâ€™s entirely unfair â€” not necessarily because Trump is actually deeply sensitive to the issues facing racial and ethnic minorities, but because Democrats are, in their view, just as bad, and are calling out Trumpâ€™s racism not out of moral imperative, but pure politics.
A debate that began over the usage of a word that carries so much historical weight as a political metaphor morphed into one that, for many conservatives, centered on a near constant irritation: perceived liberal hypocrisy.
â€œAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessingâ€
On Tuesday morning, Donald Trump decided that he had had enough of the impeachment inquiry into his apparent quid pro quo pressure on the Ukrainian government to open up an investigation into Joe Bidenâ€™s son Hunter in order to receive military aid.
He tweeted that if any Democrat were to become president, they too could face impeachment. And he added, â€œAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here â€” a lynching. But we will WIN!â€
And some Republicans came to Trumpâ€™s defense. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for example, said that the impeachment process undertaken by the House, per the Constitution, was â€œa lynching in every sense,â€ adding, â€œWhat does lynching mean? That a mob grabs you, they donâ€™t give you a chance to defend yourself, they donâ€™t tell you what happened to you, they just destroy you. Thatâ€™s exactly whatâ€™s happening in the United States House of Representatives right now.â€
Many other Republicans backed away from Trumpâ€™s word choice, saying that while they agreed with the sentiment, they disagreed with the usage of the term â€œlynching.â€
But then Breitbart found examples of Democrats using the term â€œlynchingâ€ in reference to Bill Clintonâ€™s impeachment saga, and the crux of the argument shifted to hypocrisy, not the accuracy of the term itself. As the lead of Breitbartâ€™s piece reads, â€œDemocrats are expressing outrage over President Trumpâ€™s comparison of the ongoing impeachment inquiry to â€œlynching,â€ but a top House Democrat â€” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) â€” made that same comparison himself in 1998 during Bill Clintonâ€™s impeachment.â€
The politics of â€œlynchingâ€
Nadlerâ€™s use of the term, as well as that of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in 1998, gave credence to the argument that Democrats who pilloried Trumpâ€™s use of â€œlynchingâ€ was indicative of a double standard.
As conservative commentator Ben Shapiro argued, â€œSo when Joe Biden used the word â€œlynchingâ€ to describe his perception of a politically motivated impeachment in 1998, that was merely poor word choice. When Trump used it in 2019, he obviously meant to liken himself to black victims of white supremacist violence.â€
In an email, I asked Shapiro if he thought conservatives were seeing this as part of a broader trend of hypocrisy â€” Democrats using a racialized term and then condemning Republicans for using the same. He replied simply, â€œyes.â€
This is a bigger issue than a Trump tweet. Since the beginning of the Trump administration and even since the launch of his presidential campaign, as Trump has been beset by Democrats linking him and his supporters to white supremacy and racism more broadly, conservatives and Republicans have retorted that Democrats have in the past, and are currently, using racism as a hypocritical cudgel when the need arises.
As I wrote after a blackface photo of Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam surfaced earlier this year:
For some on the right, Northamâ€™s photograph served as political vindication, proof positive that Democrats can be just as racist as Republicans. In fact, even more so, because they pretend to be otherwise and then use race, in the view of some on the right, as a weapon against them. As Conor Friedersdorf wrote back in 2010, â€œrace is used as a cudgel to discredit [conservatives] in a way that would never be applied to a political movement on the left.â€
Tom Elliott, founder of the right-leaning aggregation site Grabien, compiled a host of examples of Democrats and others using the term â€œlynching.â€ He told me that he did so to showcase that double standard.
â€œMy point in posting clips of Democrats invoking â€œlynchingâ€ was not to defend Trump but to note their hypocrisy. Pretty much anyone can attack Trump for his use of the word â€œlynchingâ€ â€” except politicians who themselves have made the exact same rhetorical point.â€
He added that he did not think Trumpâ€™s use of the term was at all accurate, saying, â€œTrump sits atop the pinnacle of political power, so itâ€™s definitely bizarre for him to claim heâ€™s the victim of a â€œlynching,â€ which historically involves mobs carrying out extrajudicial killings as a form of intimidation. This impeachment inquiry, whatever its faults, is not mob justice, and heâ€™s not a member of a minority community facing discrimination.â€
I asked him if he thought this was a widespread phenomenon. â€œYes, itâ€™s on display today, in fact,â€ he said. â€œA year ago Democrats went wild after Trump accused left-wing activists of acting like a â€˜mobâ€™; they said this word is racially charged and beyond the bounds of common decency; yet todayâ€™s Democratic talking point is that Republican who tried to access yesterdayâ€™s impeachment testimony acted â€¦ like a mob.â€
That perceived hypocrisy matters to conservatives, who think of accusations of racism or racist behavior against Republicans are largely used to get votes and force the GOP to play defense, forever, against an amorphous opponent who doesnâ€™t even really care about the alleged racism at hand.
Words still matter
When I argued in our conversation that perhaps no one should use the term to reference an event that was not, in fact, a lynching, Elliott said, â€œAmericaâ€™s political lexicon is so cliche-ridden these days that I think we need more words in circulation, not fewer.â€
But itâ€™s fairly clear here that Trump is not the victim of a lynching, metaphorical or otherwise. And neither was Bill Clinton, of whose own impeachment Joe Biden said in 1998, â€œhistory is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching.â€ And neither was Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who said in 1991 that the allegations of sexual harassment made against him by Anita Hill and the resulting media furor constituted â€œa high-tech lynching.â€ And neither was Democratic Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who this year said that the two sexual assault allegations against him represented a â€œpolitical lynching.â€
More than 4,000 black Americans were lynched in the United States between 1877 and 1950, some murdered for crimes like entering a room where white women were present. And other groups faced the scourge of lynching too â€” in 1871, 11 Italian men were lynched by a crowd numbering in the thousands who were convinced the men were responsible for the murder of a police official. It was the largest lynching in American history. The victims of real lynchings, historically, did not have the opportunity to write (or tweet) about their mistreatment, because they were dead.
Conservatives are bothered by perceived Democratic hypocrisy on the usage of the term â€œlynchingâ€. But the usage of the term in our politics by anyone, Donald Trump or Joe Biden, should perhaps be of more concern than who said it first, or more recently, or loudest, as the guardrails against racism have fallen so precipitously particularly on the edges of our politics.
The term â€œlynching,â€ regrettably, isnâ€™t alone. Iâ€™ve written before, for example, about the â€œAmericanizationâ€ of Nazism: an effort to put Nazi Germany somewhere on the American political axis, bringing us a world in which somehow both Trump and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are the equivalent of Adolf Hitler, a man responsible for the murder of more than 50 million people and the attempted extermination of entire religious and ethnic groups.
In the United States, lynching was not an experience from which a man would emerge a Supreme Court Justice, or a mildly chastened but unbowed president, or even a lieutenant governor still in office. In the United States, people who were lynched were sometimes burned to death in front of 10,000 people, or had their bodies desecrated with body parts taken by observers as trinkets. People proudly posed by the bodies of men and women hung from trees, for photographs that would be passed down from generation to generation.
As the American Conservativeâ€™s Rod Dreher wrote in 2015, â€œISIS filmed that poor Jordanian pilot burning to death as an act of revenge and terror. We call those Islamist fanatics animals. But white people did this often, and sometimes even made a public spectacle of it. â€˜The white men, women, and children present watched the horrific murders while enjoying deviled eggs, lemonade, and whiskey in a picnic-like atmosphere.â€™â€
The problem with the word â€œlynchingâ€ being used in our politics is actually not hypocrisy â€” that Trump is punished for using the term while Democrats are purportedly able to do so with abandon without criticism â€” because that argument implies that both sides should be able to use the term equally.
Like with blackface, or the term â€œNazi,â€ or referring to someone as the equivalent of Adolf Hitler, the issue is that any political figure from any political party is doing so at all."

What California went through earlier this month was absolutely bonkers.
To avoid sparking wildfires during dry, windy weather conditions, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), the stateâ€™s largest utility, shut off electrical service to some 738,000 customer accounts, representing up to 2 million people. It was a planned, deliberate blackout unprecedented in the history of the nationâ€™s electrical system.
Thereâ€™s probably no pleasant way to do something like that, but still, PG&E did it very poorly. Residents had little warning, in some cases less than 24 hours. Nursing homes, emergency rooms, police stations, and fire stations scrambled for backup generators. People with powered medical equipment or refrigerated drugs scrambled to find care at understaffed community centers, and 1,370 public schools lost power; 400 of them sent 135,000 students home to parents scrambling to cover jobs they had no way to get to.
Highways, roads, and intersections went dark without notice and caused traffic accidents. Food rotted in freezers, houses, and grocery stores. Government phone lines were overwhelmed. On top of everything else, PG&Eâ€™s website went down.
As Elizaveta Malashenko of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) put it to the New York Times: â€œItâ€™s pretty much safe in saying, this did not go well.â€
Until more data comes in, it wonâ€™t be possible to know how much the blackouts cost the state, but Stanfordâ€™s Michael Wara, an expert on electricity policy in California, estimates the total will come in somewhere between $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion.
If the rest of the country was vaguely aware that there were blackouts in California, what many donâ€™t yet fully understand is how ugly it was and how pissed off people are. And above all, they donâ€™t understand one of the most bonkers features of the whole situation: Everyone agrees it is going to happen again.
Indeed, blackouts like the ones in early October are likely to be a feature of life in the state for years to come. On Wednesday and Thursday, PG&E and Southern California Edison were either shutting off power again or considering it:
Some areas of California could see 15 or more blackouts a year, lasting two to five days. And though their impact can be better mitigated and regulators and legislators are thundering at utilities to deal with them better, there is little prospect of eliminating them.
Large-scale, deliberate blackouts are a thing in California now
Itâ€™s not just PG&E. All of Californiaâ€™s utilities, in consultation with the CPUC, have decided that shutting power off to large swathes of customers is safer, all things considered, than leaving it on during high wildfire risk conditions. All of them have plans to address the growing danger of wildfires, and all of those plans involve recurring Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS).
Whatâ€™s worse, as blackouts increase, rates will increase alongside them, as utilities invest in long-delayed maintenance and safety measures. Soon the stateâ€™s electricity customers will be paying more for worse service.
How did California end up in this semi-apocalyptic situation? It is a confluence of several trends and pressures, some natural, some of human origin, all of which have been building steadily in the background. Plenty of people in both the public and private sectors had to look the other way for a long time to allow this to happen.
In Ernest Hemingwayâ€™s The Sun Also Rises, a character is asked how he went bankrupt. â€œTwo ways,â€ he answers. â€œGradually, then suddenly.â€ Hereâ€™s where California has found itself, gradually, then suddenly: heat rising in perpetuity from climate change, decades of poor land and forestry management coming due, hundreds of thousands of miles of aging power lines strung through dry forests, billions of dollars in liability (and billions more to come) being allocated through the bankruptcy proceedings of a corrupt, mismanaged, politically connected utility, and a future that promises the nationâ€™s most expensive, least reliable electricity service.

Itâ€™s not pretty. In my next post, Iâ€™ll get into some of the ways California can address this problem. (No spoilers!)
In this post, though, Iâ€™m just going to walk through some of the main factors that led the Golden State to this impasse and explain why, as with so many things related to climate change, there is no going back to normal.
Speaking of climate change, letâ€™s start there, because whatever else Californiaâ€™s tangled story is â€” and it is many things â€” it is a parable about the challenges of adapting to a changing climate.
Californiaâ€™s forests have become tinderboxes
Fires are growing more common and more severe in California. In the last 10 years, the state has had five of its 10 largest wildfires ever, and seven of its 10 most destructive. (These grim facts and more can be found in a report on wildfires and Californiaâ€™s future commissioned by Governor Newsom, published in April.)
Two basic forces are to blame.
The first is climate change. The Atlanticâ€™s Robinson Meyer covered a paper out in July that finds, â€œsince 1972, Californiaâ€™s annual burned area has increased more than fivefold, a trend clearly attributable to the warming climate.â€ The increase mainly shows up in hotter summers and more summer fires, though the climate fingerprint is getting clearer in the rise of fall fires as well.

This is a worst-possible wildfire scenario for Southern California
In California, climate change is projected to cause more frequent and intense droughts, followed by intense periods of rain, which prompt the growth of thick underbrush, which then dries out in the subsequent droughts and becomes kindling. â€œEach degree of warming causes way more fire than the previous degree of warming did,â€ climate scientist Park Williams told Meyer.
Gov. Gavin Newsomâ€™s Strike Force report on wildfires and climate change
And the state is not alone: Research shows climate change is already increasing the number of weather-related outages across the country.
The second factor making the state more fire-prone is poor forest management. Earlier this year, journalist Mark Arax published an extraordinary feature story on the Paradise fire, Californiaâ€™s most destructive fire ever (before which PG&E considered, but decided against, a PSPS). In it, he tells the tale of how, in the 1990s, the stateâ€™s timber industry came to be dominated by rampant clear-cutting. Varied, diverse forests, with patches of scrub and trees alternating, served as natural fire breaks. Wildfires came to them periodically, as is natural and necessary for regeneration, but they did not spiral out of control.
After a clear cut, forests are replanted as monocrops. There are no natural breaks, no variation, which makes them extraordinarily vulnerable to rapidly spreading fire.

Californiaâ€™s wildfires are hardly â€œnaturalâ€ â€” humans made them worse at every step
And in the early 2000s, the forestry management practiced by park rangers â€” prescribed burns, clearing brush, remediating clearcuts â€” fell out of favor relative to an increasingly large, paramilitary fire brigade. â€œAs rangers joined up with the ranks of better-paid firefighters,â€ Arax writes, â€œtheir numbers dwindled to maybe 250, even as the number of firefighters inside the [Department of Forestry and Fire Protection] jumped to 7,000.â€ Firefighters put out fires. But consistent fire suppression only increases the amount of dry, flammable material.
As this LA Times story reveals, Californiaâ€™s clear-cutting and forest mismanagement continue to this day.
More and more people are building (and rebuilding) in fire-prone areas
California has a housing crisis, born largely of the fact that wealthier urban residents refuse to allow more housing to be built in urban areas, near jobs. Consequently, as more residents stream into the state, the price of existing urban housing stock rises and development sprawls outward. More and more of that development is being pushed into the â€œwildland-urban interfaceâ€ (WUI), where wildfires are more frequent and more difficult to fight.
Again, California is not alone. A 2018 study in PNAS found that, between 1990 and 2010, the WUI was â€œthe fastest-growing land use type in the conterminous United States.â€ This is happening in lots of states.
Gov. Gavin Newsomâ€™s Strike Force report on wildfires and climate change
But itâ€™s particularly concentrated in California, where a million houses were built in the WUI during those same years. In Mother Jones, Jeffrey Ball has a feature story on the stateâ€™s terrible land-use policies, which encourage sprawl, and specifically building (and rebuilding) in fire-prone areas, in a dozen different ways, including subsidized insurance. (See also this piece by James Temple.)
As a result, fully half of California citizens now live in areas of high wildfire threat.
CPUC
Add all this together â€” increasing heat from global warming; several years of unusually high winds and low humidity; poor logging practices with fewer preventative burns; more people living on forested ridges and hills in remote, fire-prone areas â€” and the result was disaster.
The year 2017 was the most intense and deadly wildfire season in the stateâ€™s history. Alongside 47 dead were 1.4 million acres and 9,470 homes and businesses burned. The insured losses added up to a staggering $13.2 billion.
Then came 2018. July 2018 was the hottest month ever recorded in California; the state was five degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the historical average. In the end, more than 8,000 fires left 104 people dead, 1.9 million acres burned, and more than 19,000 homes and businesses destroyed. The insured losses came in at $12.4 billion.
And hereâ€™s a fateful quirk: California law makes power utilities legally liable for the damages from wildfires they start, under a doctrine known as â€œinverse condemnation.â€ Heading into the 2019 wildfire season, California lawmakers hastily passed a law providing utilities some relief from that provision, but it was too late for PG&E, which serves 16 million customers in central and Northern California. Its power lines had, it turned out, started many of the worst fires. In January, groaning under more than $30 billion in debt for those damages, it declared bankruptcy.
So, letâ€™s talk about PG&E.
PG&E is a steaming pile of terrible management and debt now at the mercy of a bankruptcy judge
PG&E is, according to consensus opinion across California, just The Worst.
In addition to its statewide network of natural gas pipelines, the utility maintains some 26,000 miles of underground electric lines and almost 100,000 miles of overhead lines, many of which travel miles through heavily wooded territory. (Overall, the state has more than 250,000 miles of overhead lines.)
If power lines throw off sparks or â€œsagâ€ from excess voltage and touch plants or structures, or if plants and trees grow too close to lines and are blown into them, the sparks can generate intense wildfires. Between 2014 and 2017, there were more than 2,000 â€œignition eventsâ€ caused by power lines in California, which averages out to 1.5 fires a day.
A state investigation concluded that it was an aging PG&E transmission tower that caused November 2018â€™s Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in the stateâ€™s history, which killed 85 people and wiped out the town of Paradise.
Court records subsequently revealed that PG&E equipment had caused 435 fires in 2015 and 362 in 2016. It 2017, its lines caused the North Bay Fires, which burned 200,000 acres and were the largest wildfire disaster in state history until the Camp Fire, which, again, PG&E also caused.
It must be said that PG&E faces a physically more difficult task than Southern California utilities. It manages giant swathes of often sparsely populated territory, where it must maintain lines that run through hundreds of miles of hilly and sometimes mountainous forest. Given that the state is becoming a giant tinderbox and houses are invading wilderness everywhere, itâ€™s just impossible to string power lines to everyone without starting some fires.

But it must also be said that PG&E has long been wildly corrupt, incompetent, and cozy with regulators. It lavishly funds state politicians; state records show that it has donated to 8 out of 10 California legislators. It spent $208,000 just electing Newsom.
Over the years, coziness with the people meant to be overseeing it has led to a lax safety culture. As Katherine Blunt and Russell Gold reported for the Wall Street Journal, PG&E has known for years about the increasing fire risks around its decrepit, outdated infrastructure. And despite a lot of talk, and a lot of money taken from ratepayers for the purpose, it has systematically neglected basic inspections and maintenance and has done very little to improve its ability to predict, avoid, or manage wildfires. Instead, it took all that money (around $4.5 billion) and paid handsome dividends to shareholders.
Arax describes the legal cases being filed by the attorneys representing a class of more than 1,000 people who lost property in the 2017 and 2018 fires:
In their filings, each attorney traced the historic blazes to a culture of mismanagement, corruption, and cover-up that had taken hold inside PG&E decades before. A pattern of venality, they argued, began in the companyâ€™s early years and became more recalcitrant in the 1980s and 1990s, when PG&E, with the connivance of the California Public Utilities Commission, its watchdog, made a decision to place profits and bonuses to top executives â€” and dividends to shareholders â€” over safety.
A case involving the 2010 explosion of a section of PG&Eâ€™s San Bruno pipeline (which also involved deferred maintenance, cover-ups, and a bunch of dead Californians) led to a guilty verdict on five counts of willfully breaking federal safety laws and one count of obstruction, bringing a $3 million fine and five years of probation.
In court this year, federal Judge William Alsup accused the company of violating probation by, well, committing more crimes. He was confounded: â€œThe drought did not start the [Camp Fire]. Global warming did not start the fire. PG&E started it. What do we do? Does the judge just turn a blind eye and say, â€˜PG&E, continue your business as usual. Kill more people by starting more firesâ€™?â€
Alsup ordered the company to compose a paragraph-by-paragraph response to the Wall Street Journal story and forced executives to take a walking tour of Paradise, to witness what they had wrought. (They did, but in secret.)
Bankruptcy could shield PG&E from further lawsuits and force all litigants into negotiations. With $30 billion in debt (compared to annual operating revenue of less than $13 billion a year for its electricity business) and stock that analysts say may well hit zero, PG&Eâ€™s ultimate fate is in the hands of a bankruptcy judge, though the CPUC and the legislature will want to have their say.
In the meantime, the utility is scrambling to catch up on maintenance and fire safety in the face of a huge backlog. And it is being hyper-cautious. More fires this year could mean yet more liability. It has every reason to prefer a PSPS â€” the damages of which it is not liable for â€” to even a modest risk of fire, which might help explain why its outages last week were so blunt and sweeping. As the LA Times reported, the utility â€œshut down nearly 100 transmission linesâ€ that â€œstretched across 2,500 miles and linked to an additional 25,000 miles of distribution lines that also lost power â€” more than enough to wrap once around Earth.â€
Critics complain that the company is overreacting out of its own financial interests. Many blacked-out customers reported experiencing no high winds at all. State senators are getting involved.
Power is now back on for the customers who lost it in the initial PSPS, but there will be more. The age, condition, and vulnerability of the California grid have been exposed.
Californiaâ€™s grid is deeply and fundamentally vulnerable
In August 2018, the then-Governor Jerry Brown signed SB 901, a bill that addresses a number of utility/wildfire issues. Among other things, it requires all state utilities to come up with comprehensive Wildfire Mitigation Plans. Utilities have now submitted those plans and the CPUC has approved them.
PG&Eâ€™s plan is revealing. It promises to attack the backlog of maintenance and do other kinds of grid hardening (more on that in the next post), but it is also frank about the fact that such work will take up to a decade, and in the meantime, there will be more PSPSs. Other utilities say largely the same thing.
Utilities can learn to forecast better, target their blackouts more precisely, offer customers more warning, and make better plans for basic community needs during blackouts, but it probably canâ€™t eliminate them. Given that wildfire risks are only growing, itâ€™s entirely possible that sporadic blackouts will simply be a fact of life in what was, until recently, considered one of the worldâ€™s most advanced economies. And that will happen alongside rising rates.
Very little is known about the economic costs or health and safety risks of these planned blackouts. (Catherine Wolfram of the Energy Institute at Haas discusses some of the difficulties in measuring damages here.) But their costs will be enormous, in medical crises, lost workdays, and simple stress and uncertainty.

As weâ€™ve already seen, PG&E was criticized for not cutting off power before the Camp Fire, but it was also criticized for cutting it off last week. As terrible as PG&E is, there is no winning that game. Californians donâ€™t want to change where they live, or their zoning codes, or their building codes, or how much they pay for power. Nonetheless, they are going to be righteously pissed off when their electricity starts getting regularly shut off, and theyâ€™re going to want someone to blame. It is going to be an absolute political shit show for PG&E â€” or whoever operates its assets once this is all over â€” for the foreseeable future.
So what can be done about it? Must California simply accept this state of affairs?

3 key solutions to Californiaâ€™s wildfire safety blackout mess
To some extent, the unpleasant answer is yes. There are certainly better and worse courses of action the state could take, better and worse outcomes, but there is no going back to â€œnormal.â€ It can adapt to the riskier, more volatile environment that is coming, maybe even learn to thrive in it, but doing so will involve enormous changes.
In the next post in this series, I look at some of those changes. Some have to do with improving the existing grid and fire-safety procedures; some have to do with changing where and how residents build; some have to do with reforming (or breaking up) PG&E; but the main change, the inevitable and necessary change, is a change in the structure of the electricity system itself, the way it is designed and managed, to reduce the dependence of far-flung Californians on what have proven fairly hapless centralized authorities.

"America is in the middle of its deadliest drug overdose crisis in history, with the opioid epidemic now linked to tens of thousands of deaths every year and other types of drug overdoses steadily increasing in recent years.
In his nearly three years in office so far, President Donald Trump hasnâ€™t done much to fight the crisis. He declared an emergency over the opioid epidemic, but a watchdog agency found the declaration didnâ€™t lead to much actual policy change. And while Trump, with the support of Congress, has committed a few billion dollars to the opioid crisis here and there, the funding falls short of the tens of billions of dollars that experts claim is needed to fully confront the epidemic. Advocates have called Trumpâ€™s approach â€œa lot of talk, little action.â€
The Rehab Racket is Voxâ€™s investigation into Americaâ€™s notoriously opaque addiction treatment industry. Weâ€™re crowdsourcing patients and familiesâ€™ rehab stories, with an emphasis on the cost of treatment and quality of care. If youâ€™d like help our reporting by sharing your story, please fill out this survey.
The Democratic candidates for president, however, are promising a more serious approach. The candidates currently leading in the polls have rallied around proposals to commit tens of billions to the crisis and to addiction treatment in particular, with Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s bill to spend $100 billion over 10 years especially drawing support. Most candidates have also talked up their health care plans in relation to the opioid epidemic, claiming that the plans would boost access to addiction treatment by making sure itâ€™s covered by health insurance.
The Democrats have also talked a lot about holding drug companies accountable for their role in fueling the opioid crisis and curtailing excessive prescriptions for opioid painkillers, including the possibility of prosecuting and locking up opioid executives.
Fewer Democratic candidates, though, have thrown their explicit support behind expanding harm reduction approaches, such as needle exchanges, supervised consumption sites, and the opioid overdose antidote naloxone.
At the very least, though, the calls for bolder action make the Democratic candidates very different from a Trump administration that has, for the most part, neglected the crisis so far.
Most Democrats want more addiction treatment. Thereâ€™s less support around harm reduction.
The Democratic presidential candidates have generally called for holding pharmaceutical companies and their executives accountable for the opioid crisis â€” vowing not just to fine them, which the federal government has long done, but also to hold these corporations and their leaders criminally liable. Most candidates have also talked favorably about reducing prescriptions for opioid painkillers and making alternative pain treatments more available.
Beyond that, Democrats have varying proposals for expanding access to drug addiction treatment and, in fewer cases, harm reduction approaches.
The most popular proposal is the CARE Act, which Warren first introduced in 2018 with former Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD). That legislation, modeled after the Ryan White CARE Act Congress passed in 1990 to boost access to HIV/AIDS treatment, would commit $100 billion over 10 years to funding addiction treatment and harm reduction programs at the local, state, and federal levels. Itâ€™s the kind of investment that experts and advocates have said is needed to really fight the opioid epidemic.
Several candidates besides Warren, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Cory Booker, have backed the CARE Act.
Separately, other candidates have proposed their own funding boosts for addiction care and harm reduction. Pete Buttigieg put out a comprehensive mental health and addiction plan that includes $100 billion in funds for innovative local treatment approaches. Amy Klobuchar unveiled a $100 billion mental health and addiction plan. Beto Oâ€™Rourke released a $100 billion drug addiction plan as well. John Delaney put out a plan to spend $3 billion to $4 billion more a year on treatment.
This would help address a serious problem: According to federal data, just one in 10 people with a drug addiction get specialty treatment, largely because addiction treatment is often far too expensive or simply doesnâ€™t exist in an area.
The Democratic proposals go further, though, in emphasizing evidence-based treatment. As Vox is now investigating, much of the addiction treatment thatâ€™s available out there has little to no evidence behind it. (If you have gone through treatment and would like to help our reporting, fill out our survey.) But the candidatesâ€™ plans seek to target approaches that have studies and other empirical research behind them.
For opioid addiction, for example, the plans prioritize medications like methadone and buprenorphine, which studies show cut the death rate among patients by half or more. Despite the strong evidence for these medications, the majority of addiction treatment facilities in America donâ€™t offer them â€” and the candidatesâ€™ plans would try to change that.
The candidates also point to their universal health care proposals to boost access to addiction treatment. Federal laws currently require health insurers to in many cases cover treatment, but the laws are notoriously underenforced. Candidates claim their health proposals would put more enforcement behind the laws and regulations, which experts say is key to better integrating addiction treatment into the rest of the health care system.
Where thereâ€™s less explicit support is harm reduction services, which try to acknowledge that some people are going to continue using drugs and minimize the risks that come with that. Several Democrats explicitly back expanding access to naloxone, and fewer explicitly support more needle exchanges, where people can pick up sterile syringes to avoid needle-based infections. Both of these harm reduction ideas have strong evidence in their favor.
Very few â€” mainly Warren, Sanders, and Oâ€™Rourke â€” explicitly back supervised consumption sites, which are safe spaces where people can use drugs under medical supervision. Trumpâ€™s administration says that these are illegal under federal law. The sites have generally positive but somewhat weak evidence behind them.
In another area, Buttigieg and Andrew Yang have called for decriminalizing at least opioids by removing the federal threat of jail or prison time for possession. While all the candidates have talked about scaling back the war on drugs at some point, decriminalizing currently illicit drugs besides marijuana has historically gotten very little support from major party politicians. But the idea, some advocates argue, would eliminate some of the stigma and fear thatâ€™s attached to drug use and treatment.
With the exception of candidates who have said very little of substance about opioids, like JuliÃ¡n Castro, Marianne Williamson, and Wayne Messam, the Democratic candidates have generally made it clear that they would go further than Trump has. The major question is if theyâ€™d have the support from Congress needed to implement most of their plans should one of them make it to the White House.
How the Democratic candidates would address the opioid epidemic
Former Vice President Joe Biden: Bidenâ€™s health care plan, which seeks to build on Obamacare with a public option for health insurance and better enforcement of coverage rules, would help boost access to drug addiction treatment, according to his campaign. His criminal justice plan would also boost spending on treatment. And it would use treatment over incarceration for people with drug problems, as well as offer treatment to people in jail or prison. On the campaign trail, Biden has spoken about pulling back opioid prescriptions and holding drug companies accountable for their role in fueling the opioid crisis.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren: Warren has introduced a bill that would commit $100 billion over 10 years to fight drug addiction â€” a huge investment in treatment and harm reduction programs, focused on evidence-based practices like opioid addiction medications and naloxone. Sheâ€™s also acknowledged the role of health insurance, including Medicare-for-all, to help cover addiction treatment. In her criminal justice plan, Warren called for diverting people with drug addictions from prison to treatment, and backed needle exchanges and supervised consumption sites. And sheâ€™s supported separate legislation that would impose criminal penalties on big company executives that â€œknowingly hurt people through criminal negligence â€” such as fueling the opioid crisis.â€
Sen. Bernie Sanders: Sanders cosponsored Warrenâ€™s bill to commit $100 billion over 10 years to drug addiction treatment and harm reduction programs. He has also argued that Medicare-for-all will guarantee access to addiction treatment. In his criminal justice plan, he backed supervised consumption sites and needle exchanges, and emphasized the need to move away from locking up people with drug addiction and instead giving them access to treatment. And heâ€™s introduced legislation that would aim to â€œhold CEOs of drug companies criminally liable for illegal advertising, marketing, or distribution of opioids,â€ among other steps to reduce access to opioids.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg released a comprehensive plan to tackle drug addiction and mental health issues in the US. The proposal would aim to scale up addiction treatment across the country, including through a 10-year, $100 billion grant program to encourage innovation at the community level, with an emphasis on boosting access to opioid addiction medications. It would also push insurance companies to cover addiction treatment and undertake broader efforts to ensure treatment is integrated into the health care system. It would decriminalize all drug possession at the federal level and push treatment over jail or prison for people with addictions. And it would expand naloxone and needle exchange programs.
Sen. Kamala Harris: Harris cosponsored Warrenâ€™s bill to spend $100 billion over 10 years on drug addiction treatment and harm reduction programs. Her office said that her Medicare-for-all plan would expand access to addiction treatment. Sheâ€™s also supported moving away from incarceration to treatment for people with drug addictions. And sheâ€™s introduced a bill to, her office said, get the Food and Drug Administration to â€œprovide greater oversight over advertising and other promotion materials for opioid drugs,â€ including stopping misleading marketing from pharmaceutical companies.
Andrew Yang: Yang put out a plan to address the opioid crisis. It would boost funding to addiction treatment by more than $15 billion a year, and â€” in a proposal that would be extremely controversial among experts and advocates â€” require that overdose patients are â€œsent to mandatory treatment centers for three days to convince them to seek long-term treatment.â€ The plan would also take several steps to reduce opioid prescribing, including by increasing FDA regulation and imposing a tax on opioid painkiller manufacturers thatâ€™s retroactive to 2005 (which might be unconstitutional). Separately, Yang has also called for decriminalizing opioids. His plans do not give any attention to harm reduction programs, but heâ€™s spoken favorably about harm reduction on the campaign trail.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar: Klobucharâ€™s campaign put out a $100 billion plan to address mental health issues and drug addiction. The proposal would promote early interventions for drug use, including at schools, as well as boost addiction treatment, including medications for opioid addiction. It would enforce laws requiring insurers to cover addiction treatment. It would also support research for more addiction treatments and non-opioid pain treatments. And it would discourage the use of jail or prison over treatment for people who use drugs, as well as encourage first responders to carry naloxone. It would impose a 2-cent fee on each milligram of an active opioid ingredient in painkillers to help pay for the plan and try to hold drug companies accountable for their involvement in the current overdose crisis.
Former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke: Oâ€™Rourke released a comprehensive plan to address drug addiction and the opioid epidemic. It would commit $100 billion to addiction treatment, harm reduction services, and other support programs for dealing with addiction. It would ease regulations on medications for opioid addiction, and boost research to find medications for other kinds of addiction. It would push health insurance companies to cover addiction treatment, while leveraging Medicare for America, the health care bill Oâ€™Rourke supports that would essentially let anyone enroll into Medicare, to expand access as well. And it would support alternative pain management approaches, including medical marijuana, while tightening oversight of the pharmaceutical industry and opioid painkillers.
Sen. Cory Booker: Booker cosponsored Warrenâ€™s bill to spend $100 billion over 10 years on drug addiction treatment and harm reduction programs. He introduced a bill to expand addiction treatment for incarcerated individuals, and backed legislation to get insurers to pay for treatment. Heâ€™s also been a major advocate of criminal justice reform, pushing for treatment for people who use drugs instead of jail and prison time. And heâ€™s spoken about holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for their role in the opioid crisis.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard: Gabbardâ€™s campaign website does not include a plan regarding the opioid epidemic, and her staff did not return requests for comment. In the past, Gabbard introduced a bill to hold top company executives and drug manufacturers criminally liable for misleading opioid marketing. Her statements on the opioid crisis have typically focused on holding opioid companies accountable, with little attention to boosting drug addiction treatment or harm reduction services.
Former HUD Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro: Castroâ€™s campaign website does not include a plan regarding the opioid epidemic, and his staff did not return requests for comment. Based on news reports, he has made very few comments about the opioid epidemic on the campaign trail.
Marianne Williamson: Williamsonâ€™s campaign website does not include a plan regarding the opioid epidemic, and her staff did not return requests for comment. On the campaign trail, sheâ€™s spoken about holding opioid companies accountable, the excessive prescribing of painkillers, and having â€œ24-hour 12-step programming available on cable television.â€
Tom Steyer: Steyerâ€™s campaign said he will focus on incarcerating people from â€œdrug companies conspiring to addict Americans to opioids,â€ instead of simply fining them. He has also criticized Trump for enacting a tax cut that some drug companies benefited from, when much of that money could have gone to efforts to end the opioid crisis.
Sen. Michael Bennet: Bennetâ€™s health care plan includes a section on fighting drug misuse. His proposal would put $60 billion to fighting addiction and scaling up treatment. He would also require insurers to pay for addiction treatment and non-opioid pain treatments. And he would expand access to naloxone. He also vowed to hold opioid painkiller producers and distributors accountable with criminal penalties for illegal marketing and by forcing them to pay for $20 billion to help fund his plan.
Former Rep. John Delaney: Delaney put out a plan to tackle the opioid epidemic. It would spend $3 billion to $4 billion more a year, raised through a new tax on opioid painkillers, to help states expand access to addiction treatment. His campaign also pointed to his health care plan, which would take steps to get insurers to pay for more addiction treatment. Delaney would also move to curtail opioid painkiller prescribing by pushing doctors to prescribe less, going after pharmaceutical executives who played a role in the crisis, and increasing federal enforcement efforts against the diversion of opioid painkillers.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock: Bullockâ€™s campaign said he would boost access to drug addiction treatment by â€œbuild[ing] on Obamacare by adding a public option, ending surprise medical billing, and allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices.â€ As governor, he also signed a bill into law that curtails opioid painkiller prescriptions.
Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam: Messamâ€™s campaign website does not include a plan regarding the opioid epidemic, and his staff did not return requests for comment. Based on news reports, he has made very few comments about the opioid epidemic on the campaign trail.
Former Rep. Joe Sestak: Sestak said in a statement that he supports expanding access to treatment, pointing to Virginiaâ€™s program increasing reimbursement rates from Medicaid to ensure that evidence-based addiction treatment is encouraged and more available. He also said that he would improve enforcement to require insurers to pay for addiction treatment. He would increase research on addiction treatments, including into psychedelic drugs like psilocybin and MDMA. And he would take steps to punish drug companies for their role in the opioid crisis by levying fines that would be used to help pay for more treatment and establishing a new office in the Department of Justice to ensure these companies are held criminally liable."
"â€œIâ€™m a former prosecutor, and what I know is this is a perfect time for a preliminary hearing, where you would say, â€˜Show us your evidence. What evidence of a crime do you have?â€™â€ former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker told Fox News. â€œI mean, the Constitution, you know, sort of â€” abuse of power is not a crime.â€
Whitakerâ€™s argument is simple enough. Article II, Section 4 of the US Constitution details the impeachment power, and it reads short and sharp. â€œThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.â€
What Whitaker is trying to do is define high crimes and misdemeanors as, well, crimes. Acts that violate the criminal code. Iâ€™ll leave it to others to argue whether Trumpâ€™s acts were criminal, but whatâ€™s inarguable is that Whitaker is wrong about the meaning of the term â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanors.â€
To modern ears, â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanorsâ€ is a weird phrase. Isnâ€™t a misdemeanor, by definition, a minor infraction? As Judge Richard Posner wrote in his book An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton, the formula, read according to modern definitions, collapses into incoherence: â€œeither â€˜high Crimes and low Crimesâ€™ or â€˜high Crimes and high low Crimes.â€™â€
Which is a clue that modern definitions are not sufficient. We have to go back to what the words meant when they were added to the Constitution, and how theyâ€™ve been interpreted throughout US history. In that light, the conclusion is inescapable. Abuse of power may not be a crime. But it is, indisputably, a high crime and misdemeanor.
How â€œhigh Crimes and Misdemeanorsâ€ made it into the Constitution
In his excellent study â€œIndispensable Remedy: The Broad Scope of the Constitutionâ€™s Impeachment Power,â€ the Cato Instituteâ€™s Gene Healy traces the constitutional arguments that led to the final formulation.
The first question was whether there should be an impeachment power at all. Some delegates opposed it, but their objections were quickly dispatched. â€œNo point is of more importance than that the right of impeachment should be continued,â€ George Mason said. The issue at hand, he said, wasnâ€™t merely, â€œShall any man be above Justice?â€ It was whether â€œthat man be above it, who can commit the most extensive injustice?â€
The next question, then, was on what grounds impeachment would be merited. A number of formulations were proposed and rejected. â€œMalpractice or neglect of duty.â€ â€œMal- and corrupt administration.â€ â€œTreason, bribery, or corruption.â€ â€œNeglect of duty, malversation, or corruption.â€ Eventually, the 11-delegate committee charged with the section offered the narrower â€œTreason, or bribery.â€
As the delegates considered this, Mason argued that â€œattempts to subvert the Constitution may not be treason,â€ and proposed adding â€œmaladministration.â€ James Madison replied that maladministration was too â€œvague,â€ leading Mason to withdraw the suggestion, and replace it with â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanors.â€ The suggestion passed, 8 votes to 3.
But was high crimes and misdemeanors truly less vague than maladministration? As Healy notes, in the Commentaries on the Laws of England, a legal reference book that Madison said was â€œin every manâ€™s handâ€ at the Convention, the first example given of a â€œhigh misdemeanorâ€ was, yes, maladministration. And later, as a member of Congress, Madison would argue that the president could and should be impeached for the â€œwanton removal of meritorious officers.â€
There are two lessons to be drawn from this history. One is itâ€™s a reminder that the men who wrote the Constitution were just men. They were packed in hot rooms, sitting through long meetings, trying to find compromises that would win over a majority of their colleagues. The Constitution was written by committee, and documents written by committee often sacrifice clarity for consensus.
But the bigger lesson is that â€œmisdemeanorsâ€ did not mean then what it means now. In 1828, Websterâ€™s defined it as â€œill behavior; evil conduct; fault; mismanagement.â€ It wasnâ€™t a light crime, but an abusive act.
What â€œhigh Crimes and Misdemeanorsâ€ has meant through American history
The first federal official ever removed from office under the impeachment clause was Judge John Pickering, in 1803. Pickering was an alcoholic and likely suffered from early-stage dementia. He would rant and rave from the bench. The official charges held that Pickering exhibited â€œloose morals and intemperate habitsâ€ and presided over court â€œin a state of total intoxication,â€ neither of which sounds like a high crime or misdemeanor to modern ears. He was convicted on all counts and removed from office.
In his 1833 Commentaries, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story concluded that impeachment is â€œof a political characterâ€ and can be triggered by â€œgross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, in the discharge of the duties of political office.â€
This has continued through to the modern day. A 2015 Congressional Research Service report surveyed every House impeachment in American history and concluded that â€œless than a third have specifically invoked a criminal statute or used the term â€˜crime.â€™â€
In 1974, as the House Judiciary Committee prepared for the Nixon impeachment, it released a report surveying past impeachments, and concluded that the behavior Congress has traditionally considered impeachable fell into three categories:
1) Exceeding the constitutional bounds of the powers of the office in derogation of the powers of another branch of government; 2) behaving in a manner grossly incompatible with the proper function and purpose of the office; and 3) employing the power of the office for an improper purpose or for financial gain.
This is not as helpful as it might be. Most modern presidencies have arguably exceeded the constitutional bounds of the office. Numbers two and three are judgment calls as well. The best the House Judiciary Committee could do was embrace the ambiguity. â€œThe longing for precise criteria is understandable,â€ they wrote, but misguided. When it comes to presidential misconduct, â€œthe crucial factor is not the intrinsic quality of behavior but the significance of its effect upon our constitutional system or the functioning of our government.â€
Pause on that for a moment. â€œThe significance of the effect.â€ A similar idea shows up in the definitions other legal scholars offer, too.
In Impeachment: A Citizenâ€™s Guide, Cass Sunstein says that the impeachment power applies to the â€œegregious violation of the public trust while in office.â€
In Impeachment: A Handbook, Charles Black Jr. says high crimes and misdemeanors describe offenses that â€œso seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator.â€
In To End a Presidency, Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz write, â€œimpeachable offenses involve corruption, betrayal or an abuse of power that ... risk grave injury to the nation.â€
When I asked Gene Healy for his simplest definition, he said, â€œHigh crimes and misdemeanors are serious misconduct that demonstrates in officials unfitness to hold high office or to wield power.â€

Abusing power to keep power
In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton argues that impeachment concerns abuses primarily â€œpoliticalâ€ in nature. Itâ€™s easy to read that as a tautology: Of course a politicianâ€™s offenses will be political in nature. A clearer way to put his point is that impeachable offenses are those that endanger the political system itself.
The point of impeachment isnâ€™t to punish the president but to protect the political system. Offenses that endanger the system â€” that undermine elections, that corrupt the functions of government, that break constitutional boundaries â€” cannot be left to elections because they warp elections.
That is, of course, what we are seeing today. Donald Trumpâ€™s plan was explicitly to force a statement from the president of Ukraine saying that his political rival Joe Biden was under investigation for corruption. If the scheme had worked â€” and it nearly did â€” the election itself would have been compromised. When Black spoke of offenses that â€œso seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator,â€ this is the kind of offense he described: an act that forces us to doubt the nature of elections so long as the perpetrator is a participant.
This is why abuse of power is precisely the kind of offense that counts as a high crime and misdemeanor, whether or not the abuse in question is criminal: There is nothing more corrosive to systems of government than permitting officials to abuse power in order to amass power. When that is permitted, systems quickly crumble into autocracy.
The Founders saw that clearly. Will we?

"Meritocracy is such an intuitive concept that defining it feels redundant. It is the idea that social and economic rewards should track talent, effort, and achievement. Spots at the most prestigious educational institutions should go to the smartest kids; positions at the highest-paying firms should be given to the most-skilled workers. While the term â€œmeritocracyâ€ was first coined just over 60 years ago, it has become so deeply ingrained into our collective ethos that it is hard to imagine a just society organized any other way.
It is not surprising, then, that most criticism of meritocracy is made by those who accept its basic principles. Earlier this year, the story broke of a far-reaching college admissions scandal involving at least 50 super-rich parents who essentially bribed their childrenâ€™s way into elite colleges and universities. In a rare moment of national bipartisanship, voices from across the political spectrum reacted in outrage to this revelation.
The incident was a reminder that even the most critical commentary often focuses on the fact that our so-called meritocracy is not quite meritocratic enough; entrance into the ranks of the elite is still rigged in favor of the wealthy and privileged at the expense of the most intelligent and hardest working.
This is what we can think of as the aspirational critique of meritocracy. It posits that the problem with our current system isnâ€™t the ideal of meritocracy itself but our collective failure to live up to that ideal. If only we could replace the forces of aristocracy, oligarchy, and corruption with a genuine meritocracy, then we would have a just and equal society.
There is also a principled critique of meritocracy, although it is far less common. Principled critics argue that any society where socioeconomic reward is based on the principle of â€œmeritâ€ itself is inherently unjust. For them, the ideal of meritocracy is flawed and must be replaced either by radical egalitarianism or a return to aristocracy.
Aspirational critics tend to dominate the meritocracy debate. Clear violations of meritocratic principles evoke bipartisan public backlash. Attempts to make the meritocratic ladder more fair and accessible â€” such as need-blind admission policies and nondiscriminatory hiring practices â€” are commonplace. The â€œAmerican Dreamâ€ is itself a meritocratic notion of rising from rags to riches on hard work and talent alone.
This is what makes Daniel Markovitsâ€™s new book The Meritocracy Trap so fascinating. At its core, The Meritocracy Trap is a comprehensive â€” and rather scathing â€” critique of the aspirational view. Markovits argues that meritocracy itself is the problem: It produces radical inequality, stifles social mobility, and makes everyone â€” including the apparent winners â€” miserable. These are not symptoms of systemic malfunction; they are the products of a system that is working exactly as it is supposed to.
At the same time, Markovits refuses to reject meritocracy altogether. He instead offers a vision for completely reimagining it.
Meritocracy is the new face of inequality
Aspirational critics tend to believe that rising inequality since the 1970s is the product of insufficient meritocracy. Some argue that the American elite is functionally an old-fashioned aristocracy that owes its income to nepotism and opportunism. Others argue that the elite is functionally an oligarchy that owes its rising income to a shift away from labor and toward capital. According to this view, elites donâ€™t even need nepotism â€” they are using preexisting wealth and inheritance to rebuild an old-fashioned feudal class.
Markovitsâ€™s analysis leads him to the opposite conclusion: Rising inequality is the product of meritocracy itself.
At midcentury, the super-rich really were a mix of oligarchs and aristocrats. In the 1950s and â€™60s, the richest 1 percent of earners received around three-quarters of their income from capital. Sociologist Thorstein Veblen called elites at the time a â€œleisure classâ€ because they rarely worked and instead spent their days mastering nonproductive tasks as social signifiers of their wealth. Those who did work, for instance, as managers, partners at law firms, and bankers, worked relatively few hours. All the while, ordinary working people toiled for long, strenuous hours just to make a decent living.
This is no longer the case. As Markovits explained in an interview with Voxâ€™s Ezra Klein:
Fifty, 60, 70 years ago, you could tell how poor somebody was by how hard they worked. Today, that relationship has been completely reversed. Elites work for a living. They work harder than they used to. They work harder in terms of brute hours than the middle class on average, and they get most of their income by working.
This isnâ€™t an exaggeration. A Harvard Business Review survey found that 62 percent of high-earning individuals work over 50 hours a week, more than a third work over 60 hours a week, and one in 10 work over 80 hours a week. According to Markovits, elites today work an average of 12 more hours per week than middle-class workers (the equivalent of 1.5 additional workdays).
The rich are also more skilled than ever. Students from the top 1 percent of households overwhelmingly dominate elite colleges and universities, despite the fact that bribery and nepotism are much less the norm.
The rich today are no longer an indolent â€œleisure classâ€ but what Markovits calls a â€œsuperordinateâ€ working class: they work harder, longer, and perform more high-skilled work than ever before. As a result, Markovits calculates that three-quarters of elite income now originates from labor rather than inherited capital.
A foundational assumption of the aspirational critique is that a more fully meritocratic society is also a more equal one. But Markovitsâ€™s analysis leads to the opposite conclusion: Skyrocketing inequality has taken place on meritocracyâ€™s own terms.
When meritocracy wins, everybody loses
This leads us to Markovitsâ€™s second critique of the aspirational view: The cycle that produces meritocratic inequality severely harms not only the middle class but the very elite who seem to benefit most from it.
Meritocratic inequality works like this: First, elite workers acquire super-skilled jobs, displacing middle-class labor from the center of economic production. Then, those elite workers use their massive incomes to monopolize elite education for their children, ensuring that their offspring are more qualified to dominate high-skilled industries than their middle-class counterparts. The cycle continues, generating what Markovits calls â€œsnowball inequalityâ€: a compounding feedback loop that amplifies economic inequality, dramatically suppresses social mobility, and creates a â€œtime divideâ€ between an elite class whose members work longer and longer (due to a higher demand for their talents) and an increasingly idle middle class (whose work has been made redundant).
The most obvious victim of this cycle is the middle class. Forced idleness excludes the middle class from a feeling of social usefulness. Stagnating wages and rising debt levels exclude the middle class from socioeconomic prosperity. Diminishing social mobility excludes the middle class from the hope of achieving the American Dream.
At the same time that meritocratic inequality excludes the middle class, meritocratic ideology convinces the middle class that this situation is their own fault. â€œThe meritocracy trap,â€ writes Markovits, â€œimprisons the imagination, casting economic exclusion as an individual failure to measure up.â€
The impact of this exclusion itself is impossible to measure, but increasing meritocratic inequality has coincided with the opioid epidemic, a sharp increase in â€œdeaths of despair,â€ and an unprecedented fall in life expectancy concentrated in poor and middle-class communities.
Meritocracy harms the elite as well. Life for the meritocratic elite is dominated by work. Substantial numbers of elites report that their work interferes with their health, prevents them from forming strong relationships with their children, gets in the way of good relationships with their spouses, and even makes it harder to have a satisfying sex life.
Most perniciously, meritocracy turns life for the elite into an endless competition. The meritocratic race begins in early childhood (the most competitive preschools admit fewer than 10 percent of applicants), continues into the teenage years (college admissions are more competitive than ever) and then extends into the workplace (elite workplaces employ â€œup or outâ€ promotion policies to cull underperformers and separate workers of the same rank into performance-based tiers).
In order to win this competition, elites are forced to exploit their own talents and abilities. They spend their lives acquiring the degrees, skills, attitudes, and habits (i.e. â€œhuman capitalâ€) that makes them valuable to elite educational institutions and employers. In doing so, elites, Markovits writes, transform themselves into â€œasset manager[s] whose portfolio contains [their] own persons.â€ This process damages the very identity of its participants.
[Elites] become constituted by their achievements, so that eliteness goes from being something that a person enjoys to being everything that he is. In a mature meritocracy, schools and jobs dominate elite life so immersively that they leave no self apart from status.
In short, elites are shuttled into a life-long, endless competition that not only consumes their life quantitatively but qualitatively as well, leaving no room for self-expression, actualization, or discovery â€” only self-exploitation, value extraction, and endless anxiety.
Worse yet, the same habits, values, attitudes, and skills that make elites so valuable in school and at work damage life outside of those institutions. Klein and Markovits discuss this in their interview:
Ezra Klein
The meritocracy ... starts when youâ€™re young and have the space for it, but then it shapes your personality. You develop certain energies and addictions and ways to deal with your own anxiety about your own worth that becomes embedded into you as a person. That seems poisonous to me.
Daniel Markovits
I think thatâ€™s right. Also, itâ€™s a skill to know how to deploy your time successfully at any activity and elites have trained themselves to do that to be successful at work. But itâ€™s also a skill to deploy your time successfully at nonproductive things: to have a hobby or a drawn out Sunday afternoon casually with family or friends. Itâ€™s not just that elites are addicted to work. Itâ€™s that they donâ€™t have the skill [of leisure].
Thereâ€™s this phrase you sometimes hear among elites about â€œquality timeâ€ with children. But maybe what children and families need is just quantity time -- time devoted to the project of spending time together. â€œQuality timeâ€ has this idea that thereâ€™s some external project. It [allows elites] to remake the home on the model of work as opposed to developing the skill of spending hours meandering around human beings in a family.
Thatâ€™s a skill that itâ€™s very hard to develop if youâ€™re a member of the elite who from the beginning of school has been taught how to make every minute have a payoff. Itâ€™s hard to shift over and learn how to make minutes not have payoffs.
As a former management consultant, I couldnâ€™t help but resonate with these words. Over the course of just a year, I watched my close personal relationships, my mental health, and my self-worth crumble under the weight of 16-hour days, a hyper-competitive payscale, and a never-off-the-clock mentality.
Along with Markovits, I will happily concede that the elite are â€œno objects of sympathy.â€ But while life at the top might be materially glamorous, it can also be a spiritual and psychological nightmare that leaves no part of oneâ€™s existence unscathed. When Markovits writes that meritocracy â€œfundamentally remakes elite life,â€ he means it in the most dystopian sense.
This is the fundamental flaw of the aspirational critique. It assumes that a meritocracy that genuinely rewards the best and the brightest will leave everyone better off. That couldnâ€™t be further from the truth: When meritocracy is realized, misery abounds.
Down with the meritocracy?
Clearly, Markovits is no fan of the meritocracy, though he isnâ€™t willing to go so far as to reject it outright. At one point in their conversation, Klein asks whether there is some version of the meritocracy that Markovits would accept or if the very notion of merit-based competition needs to be thrown out altogether. Markovitsâ€™s response is telling.
You have to be right that the best society is one where people get ahead by being good at things that are worth doing. And that sounds like a kind of meritocracy. On the other hand, one of the essential features of the sort of meritocracy we have today is intensive competition. â€¦ The kind of system that I want is one where social and economic life advantages are given to people who are â€œgood enoughâ€ at the thing that theyâ€™re doing to be socially useful.
What Markovits is striving for is not an aspirational affirmation of the meritocratic ideal nor a principled rejection of merit, but a rethinking of meritocracyâ€™s own standard of success. When we think of meritocracy, we tend to think of â€œthe best and the brightestâ€ being rewarded, but Markovits wants to introduce a new version of meritocracy where being â€œthe bestâ€ is far less important than being simply â€œgood enough.â€
In other words, Markovits wants to move us away from a polarized meritocracy â€” one characterized by a massive skill-and-reward gap between elite workers and other workers â€” to a compressed meritocracy defined by broad, shared prosperity between mid-skilled workers. As Markovits describes to Klein:
We should favor ways of organizing our social and economic life so things that are socially productive are more nearly equally rewarded. And we should pick ways of making things, ways of delivering services, ways of running schooling that donâ€™t skew achievement so far at the very top. â€¦ We could organize finance so that the middle of the skill distribution, the old home loan officer, is the dominant worker. We could organize medicine in such a way that the difference between the specialist doctor, the nurse practitioner, and the pharmacist is relatively small and most health care is delivered by people in the middle of the skill distribution. ... The core thing to do is to find policies both in education and the labor market that recompress the distribution of economic roles.
The idea behind a compressed meritocracy is simple: to open meritocracyâ€™s gates to a broader portion of the population and, in doing so, make life within those gates more palatable. A more egalitarian distribution of working hours, incomes, and social esteem would not only give dignity to the middle class but diminish the heavy burden on elites. A more open and inclusive higher education system would not only increase social mobility for the middle class but reduce the hypercompetitive pressures that dominate elite life. A more egalitarian meritocracy would be a better meritocracy for all.
Markovitsâ€™s modest policy recommendations for compressing American meritocracy fall well short of a comprehensive agenda. But the value of The Meritocracy Trap is not to give us a roadmap out of our current circumstances; it is to allow us to see our current situation for what it really is. For better or worse, meritocracy is the water all of us swim in. We implicitly accept its values, practices, arguments, and assumptions because they govern our everyday lives. This book is an opportunity for all of us to step out of the water and perhaps conclude that the meritocracy we have built is failing us.
At the same time, The Meritocracy Trap reminds us that we need not throw away the notion of meritocracy altogether. To build a world that is simultaneously democratic, egalitarian, and meritocratic may be a difficult task, but not an impossible one.

"South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg wants women to know that he is an ally. That he gets their frustration over the gender pay gap. That he knows what consent means and what the â€œmotherhood penaltyâ€ is all about.
On Thursday, he released a 26-page agenda focused entirely on womenâ€™s rights. Itâ€™s one of the most detailed plans focused on women so far in the Democratic primary.
Much of the agenda includes promises that other candidates have already made, such as guaranteeing 12 weeks of paid leave to new parents and endorsing the Equal Rights Amendment. But he goes even further than others in some cases. For example, he vows to nominate women for at least half of the cabinet positions and judicial seats if he makes it to the White House. He also said he would support the creation of a Smithsonian Womenâ€™s History Museum on the National Mall and would establish a commission to increase the number of national monuments dedicated to women. He would also put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.
Buttigiegâ€™s women-focused agenda comes as he prepares to meet this weekend with New Hampshire voters at a town hall focused on womenâ€™s economic empowerment and a roundtable focused on family issues. â€œItâ€™s an important plan for Pete to put out to demonstrate his commitment to taking on gender inequality as president,â€ a campaign spokesperson said in an email to Vox.
Itâ€™s also a smart political strategy.
Polls show that Buttigieg has some support from female voters, but he could do better. The latest Morning Consult polling shows that heâ€™s the top pick for 4.9 percent of women who will likely vote in the Democratic primary, compared to 6 percent total support among primary voters. Former Vice President Joe Biden is the top pick for women, according to the poll, followed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. But Buttigiegâ€™s closest primary rival, Sen. Kamala Harris, has more support than he does: 5.8 percent.
Harris has her own plan focused on women and gender equality, and she has repeatedly brought these issues to the forefront of her campaign. With a record number of women vying for the White House, Buttigieg is trying to show voters that male politicians can be feminists, too.
Buttigiegâ€™s plan to close the gender pay gap offers much-needed transparency
Part of Buttigiegâ€™s plan focuses on enforcing laws that are already on the books.
He wants to double funding for the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, for example, which enforces anti-discrimination laws in the workplace. Right now, the EEOC is severely underfunded, which has caused a backlog of cases for staff lawyers to investigate.
His plan also shows a deep understanding of the barriers working women face. He wants to ban companies from asking new hires about their salary history, as basing salary offers on past compensation perpetuates discrimination that keeps womenâ€™s salaries lower then menâ€™s. Some cities and states have already banned the question.
Buttigieg also supports legislation that would require companies to publish the median pay gap within its workforce, specifically the difference in earnings between women and men, and between white employees and workers of color. That would be a huge step toward helping identify pay disparities. The EEOC just began requiring companies to submit detailed pay data broken down by gender and race, but none of that information is public. Letting the public see this data would give companies a strong incentive to address pay discrimination.
â€œTransparency allows the public to hold companies accountable for treating women fairly, and enables women to make decision about where to work and what salary to negotiate,â€ Buttigieg states in his plan.
In other areas, Buttigieg plays it safe by endorsing legislation that most Democratic candidates have already endorsed.
Buttigieg said he supports legislation similar to the Family Act, which would provide parents with 12 weeks of partially paid parental and medical leave, funded through an increase in payroll taxes on workers and businesses. The bill is endorsed by most Democratic frontrunners, though Buttigieg says he will tweak it so that using parental leave doesnâ€™t decrease the amount of paid medical leave an employee can take.
He also endorses the Schedules That Work Act, which guarantees predictable schedules for workers, or extra pay if they have to work irregular schedules. He also backs the Healthy Families Act, which would require most businesses to provide full-time workers with at least seven days of paid sick leave. Most Democratic candidates also endorse these bills.
The South Bend, Indiana, mayor does have an interesting idea to get more women into federal politics, though. He wants to use federal funds to match donations to women and low-income candidates, considering that fundraising is a key barrier to women seeking office. Public financing for federal elections will â€œlevel the playing fieldâ€ in politics, he writes.
Buttigiegâ€™s promise to make child care affordable for everyone is a bit vague, though he says he will release a detailed plan soon. Itâ€™s an important issue: The high cost of child care is an enormous barrier for mothers who want to join the workforce, and a huge burden on families who pay for it.
He would also spend $50 billion to increase access to capital and mentorship for female business owners. He just doesnâ€™t say where this money would come from.
One of the most novel parts of his plan involves extending Social Security benefits to caregivers. Right now, people who take care of children and relatives full time do not receive Social Security credit for their work. Under the plan, they would get the equivalent of 50 percent of the average earnings of a full-time worker. Once again, he doesnâ€™t say how this will get funded. After all, caregivers donâ€™t pay Social Security taxes like other workers do, and itâ€™s not like the Social Security Trust Fund has a lot of extra money to spend. But the idea makes sense and would go far toward giving women a more secure retirement.
Buttigiegâ€™s plan to promote womenâ€™s health, safety, and reproductive rights
When it comes to abortion rights, Buttigiegâ€™s plan is hardly revolutionary. It mostly mirrors what other Democrats have promised to do.
Most of the 2020 Democrats agree on a few broad policy proposals on abortion: repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions; codifying the right to an abortion in federal statute if Roe v. Wade is overturned; and repealing the domestic and global gag rules to allow recipients of federal family planning funding to perform and refer for abortions.
So does Buttigieg.
Abortion matters to American voters. In a poll earlier this year, 79 percent of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers said support for abortion rights is essential for a candidate â€” more so than any other issue.
As abortion opponents are continuing their efforts to chip away at Roe v. Wade, a case before the Supreme Court this year could significantly weaken the decision. The next president will almost certainly have the opportunity to make at least one appointment to the Court, helping determine whether the march of abortion restrictions hastens or slows.
With many state laws already in place restricting access to abortion services, one notable aspect of Buttigiegâ€™s plan involves expanding access by letting doctors prescribe abortion medication remotely to women who donâ€™t have a clinic nearby.
Preventing and responding to sexual harassment is also a central focus of Buttigiegâ€™s agenda. He wants all public school students to be trained on the basics of sexual consent and bystander intervention. He also wants to force companies to disclose the number of sexual harassment incidents reported, investigated, and settled each year. And he plans to ban the use of nondisclosure agreements, which are often used to silence women who have experienced sexual harassment on the job.
The next president will also need to focus on maternal health care. Right now, women are dying from childbirth at a higher rate than they did a generation ago, and women of color have the highest maternal mortality rates. Buttigieg plans to address this alarming trend by supporting legislation that requires hospitals and clinic staff to take anti-bias and anti-racism training. He also said he would increase funding for the Maternal Mortality Review Commissions and expand postpartum mental health services.
Also, in often-overlooked health care, Buttigieg also wants to require health insurance companies to cover the costs of gender affirming medical treatments for transgender women.
How Buttigiegâ€™s womenâ€™s plan compares to other candidatesâ€™ proposals
Aside from Harris and former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke, none of the other candidates have released a thorough agenda focused entirely on womenâ€™s rights. The majority do have plans to make abortion more accessible to women who need them, similar to what Buttigieg proposes. Nearly all of the candidates also have a plan to address the high rate of maternal mortality, some even more ambitious than Buttigiegâ€™s. Elizabeth Warren, for example, wants to reward hospitals that reduce black maternal mortality rates and punish those that fail to do so.
Oâ€™Rourke wants to allocate $100 billion in federal contracts to women-owned small businesses.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, like Buttigieg, also wants to close what is known as the â€œboyfriend loophole,â€ which would stop people who have a history of abusing dating partners from owning guns.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has a campaign webpage focused just on womenâ€™s issues, but it doesnâ€™t include anything more than what everyone else has already promised. Tom Steyerâ€™s campaign webpage on womenâ€™s equality has even fewer policy details.
While Harris and Buttigieg have the most detailed policy proposals, Harrisâ€™s are more ambitious. For example, she wants to put the burden on companies to prove that they are paying women and men equally by requiring corporations to obtain an Equal Pay Certificate. Companies that canâ€™t get the certificate will be fined 1 percent of their profits for every 1 percent in their wage gap.
That said, no one but Buttigieg has made a firm commitment to nominate women for 50 percent of cabinet positions and judicial seats.
All in all, Buttigiegâ€™s campaign seems to have a deep understanding of some of the biggest challenges women are facing. While some of his policies stand out, most are pretty safe choices. However, it may be enough to persuade more women to pick him.
Clarification: A previous version of this article omitted the fact that Beto Oâ€™Rourke has also released a detailed plan to address gender inequality."
"Questions and conspiracies about potential insider trading going on around President Donald Trumpâ€™s market-moving policy decisions arenâ€™t new, but theyâ€™ve recently gained extra momentum thanks to a Vanity Fair story. So much so that some Democratic lawmakers are calling for regulators to look into whatâ€™s going on. But the issue isnâ€™t so clear-cut; many financial experts and Wall Street observers say thereâ€™s nothing to see there at all.
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening: On October 16, Vanity Fair published an article by William Cohan suggesting a mysterious group of unidentified futures traders have made billions of dollars off of some conspicuously timed trades made just ahead of some major political developments. The story quotes an unnamed trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the fishy deals are alleged to have taken place, declaring that there is â€œdefinite hanky-panky going on.â€ Cohan published a similar story in July about investors wondering whether there was some inside information being passed around related to Trump.
While the summertime story didnâ€™t make many waves, this latest one has. Critics say the allegations made in Cohanâ€™s articles donâ€™t make sense: The trades heâ€™s flagging arenâ€™t particularly notable, they argue, and these are just unfounded conspiracies. The CME has denied the articleâ€™s claims as â€œpatently false.â€
Meanwhile, some Democrats in the House of Representatives and Senate are pushing government regulators to look into whatâ€™s going on, calling the tradersâ€™ allegations â€œtroublingâ€ and demanding an investigation into â€œwhether any rules, laws, or regulations were violatedâ€ by investors with inside knowledge from the Trump administration.
Cohan, the articleâ€™s author, is pushing back against the criticism. He says he was just reporting what his sources told him, and at the very least, regulators should take a peek behind the curtain to see who is behind the trades. â€œIâ€™m surprised at how controversial this became, or seems to be becoming,â€ Cohan told me. â€œThis is what reporters do. We should want to raise issues where thereâ€™s smoke and see if thereâ€™s fire.â€
The Vanity Fair article and the pushback, briefly explained
Cohenâ€™s October article on the â€œfantastically profitable mystery of the Trump chaos tradesâ€ lays out observations made by some traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a derivatives market for futures and options trading, about a handful of transactions in S&P 500 e-mini futures â€” electronically traded futures contracts that track the S&P 500 index and sort of seek to predict where itâ€™s headed. For example, it notes that someone bought 420,000 e-minis on June 28, before Trump announced trade talks with China were â€œback on track,â€ and potentially made $1.8 billion. Or on September 13, someone shorted 12,000 e-minis (meaning they essentially bet the market would go down), before a drone strike on two Saudi Arabian oil installations, and made $180 million off of the deal.
Cohan wrote that transactions such as these had sparked speculation among CME traders that something was afoul:
Are the people behind these trades incredibly lucky, or do they have access to information that other people donâ€™t have about, say, Trumpâ€™s or Beijingâ€™s latest thinking on the trade war or any other of a number of ways that Trump is able to move the markets through his tweeting or slips of the tongue? Essentially, do they have inside information?
The story didnâ€™t outright declare that there was certainly a problem, but it called on regulators to find out. Cohan says that the SEC declined to comment on his story, though someone from within the commission reached out to him to ask him about the trades he was referencing, and the CFTC ignored his calls. The SEC declined to comment for this story and did not respond to a question about any outreach to Cohan.
Among many Wall Street analysts, market experts, and observers, the Vanity Fair article raised some eyebrows, and many people panned it as wildly speculative and off-base.
Bloomberg ran a story about analystsâ€™ skepticism of the Vanity Fair story. One market strategist told the publication that without trading records, â€œyou canâ€™t tie one and one together to make two the way this story is laid out.â€ Another noted that while the story looked at a handful of times where someone got these trades right, there are a ton of times where people get these trades wrong, and â€œvolume spikes happen all the time.â€
Felix Salmon in Slate laid out a lengthy critique:
In order to provide evidence of insider trading, you need two key ingredients. You need to show that someone made a profit and you need to show that they had inside information. In this case, Cohan provides neither. Heâ€™s basically p-hacking: Heâ€™s saying that if the people doing these trades had been insider trading, then they would have been insider trading. Which doesnâ€™t really get us very far.
Salmon also pointed out the trader quoted in the Vanity Fair story appears to believe a debunked conspiracy theory that al-Qaeda â€œcashed inâ€ before the September 11 attacks. The 9/11 Commission report found that while some unusual trading had occurred, each trade had an â€œinnocuous explanation.â€
Cohan emphasized that he was just reporting what sources he trusts were telling him. â€œTo me, this is what journalism is all about,â€ he said.
Now Democrats are asking questions
While Cohanâ€™s July story was met with a yawn, this October one was not â€” and some lawmakers are asking questions.
Last week, Reps. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and Kathleen Rice (D-NY) sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the FBI asking them to investigate â€œpotentially unlawful behavior related to the trading of electronically traded futures contractsâ€ on the CME in the last several months, citing the Vanity Fair report. â€œWhile the aforementioned trades may be purely coincidental, their timing and scale raise serious suspicions about whether the traders received material nonpublic information that would affect the S&P and how they received such information,â€ they wrote.
Then on Monday, Sens. Jack Reed (D-RI), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) sent a letter to the SEC, CFTC, FBI, and Department of Justice calling for a probe. A total of 15 senators have signed on, including 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), who tweeted out that the Vanity Fair story was â€œdisturbing.â€
â€œThe professional traders of e-minis, they see anomalies in the market that seem to be well-timed. Is there anything to them? They tell me about them. I reported it, and fortunately, these senators and these two congressmen called for these investigations, which is exactly what should happen,â€ Cohan said. â€œNothing would be make me happier, frankly, than there would be nothing to this.â€
Just because something looks fishy doesnâ€™t mean it is
Itâ€™s true that Trump has the ability to move markets, and itâ€™s not outlandish to wonder whether he or people in his orbit are trading around insider information or tipping off their friends. And itâ€™s true that regulators, overall, could do a lot better when it comes to insider trading across the board. Insider trading and white-collar crime in general are broadly under-prosecuted in the United States.
But just because something seems like it could potentially be off doesnâ€™t mean it is, and a lot of Trumpâ€™s critics want to see fire everywhere, even when sometimes itâ€™s just smoke.
Early in Trumpâ€™s presidency, he was a net positive for the stock market: Wall Street was excited about the tax cuts and deregulation his White House tenure promised and it ignored a lot of the chaos. But in recent months, the Trump whiplash has become harder to shake off for investors, especially in light of Trumpâ€™s trade war with China and his public criticism of the Federal Reserve.
In September, JPMorgan rolled out its â€œVolfefe Index,â€ a callback to the presidentâ€™s infamous â€œcovfefeâ€ tweet, that tracks the effects of Trumpâ€™s tweets. It found that when Trump tweets using the words â€œChina,â€ â€œbillion,â€ â€œproducts,â€ â€œdemocrats,â€ and â€œgreat,â€ the market tends to react.
Trump has gotten into hot water before â€” or at least as much as he can â€” for tipping his hand on information that might affect the stock market. In June, he tweeted about the May jobs report before it came out and suggested positive news â€” generally a no-no.
People in the presidentâ€™s inner circle have been hit with insider trading allegations as well. Former Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY), Trumpâ€™s first congressional endorser, resigned from the House after being charged with insider trading and pleaded guilty in the case in October. Democratic senators have pressed for regulators to look into potential insider trading by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. And Trump, his family, and his allies have shown few qualms about profiting off of his presidency.
Thatâ€™s why when stories like this Vanity Fair one take off, itâ€™s so easy for Trumpâ€™s critics to believe. He seems so eager to bend and break the rules elsewhere, why not here? But the market is notoriously hard to time and its reaction is often difficult to predict. Maybe there is some information-trading going on, but what you need is evidence â€” not a feeling that it is.
â€œI had been wondering how long it would take someone to misuse the futures market data and claim there has been trading with inside political information. Frankly, Iâ€™m a little disappointed it look this long,â€ said Nick Colas, co-founder of market insight firm Datatrek Research, in an email. â€œI suppose all the fuss about this will force regulators to check it out. The odds of anything coming back are really low.â€"
"President Donald Trump complained he is being lynched in a tweet Tuesday that brought rapid condemnation from Democratic lawmakers â€” particularly those who were themselves once in danger of being lynched.
â€œIf a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,â€ Trump wrote. â€œAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching.â€
Republicans are not witnessing anything of the kind. The impeachment inquiry Trump faces for requesting foreign governments investigate a political rival is not a lynching â€” not even close.
Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham disagreed with this fact, however, telling reporters Tuesday, â€œThis is a lynching in every sense.â€
He added, â€œWhat does lynching mean? That a mob grabs you, they donâ€™t give you a chance to defend yourself, they donâ€™t tell you what happened to you, they just destroy you. Thatâ€™s exactly whatâ€™s happening in the United States House of Representatives right now.â€
Lynchings were lawless killings committed by groups of white Americans usually targeting fellow Americans of different races: black Americans, Asian Americans, Latinx Americans. They were used to reinforce a system of control, and to prevent these minorities from even thinking about enjoying their rights as US citizens.
The impeachment inquiry is not this.
It is not the work of a mob whipped into a frenzy of racial violence, and an impeached Trump would not be a mutilated corpse photographed for souvenir postcards or to be divided, body parts sold off as macabre relics.
An impeachment inquiry is not something that can be launched at any time for any perceived slight or because a president is enjoying the American dream a bit more than his fellow citizens think he or she should â€” it is a lawful process triggered when a president is suspected of improper behavior, a process outlined in the Constitution.
And this fact, coupled with the evil history of lynching, has led to swift and powerful condemnation of the tweet by lawmakers.
Rep. Bobby Rush, who was a Black Panther in Illinois during the time that party was under a federal investigation, responded on Twitter, writing: â€œYou think this impeachment is a LYNCHING? What the hell is wrong with you? Do you know how many people who look like me have been lynched, since the inception of this country, by people who look like you.â€
In a speech on the House floor Tuesday, Rep. Al Green, who has himself been threatened with lynching, said of the tweet, â€œThis makes you no better than those who were screaming â€˜blood and soil,â€™ â€˜Jews will not replace us.â€™ It makes you no better than those who burned crosses. It makes you no better than those who wear hoods and white robes. Do you not understand what youâ€™re doing to this country?â€
A past impeachment proceeding was also described as a lynching. It was wrong then, too.
Although some Republicans condemned Trumpâ€™s tweet, a number of his allies began to point out some Democrats used similar language in 1998, when former President Bill Clinton faced impeachment.
Current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden â€” then a senator â€” said, â€œhistory is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching.â€
House Judiciary Committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler â€” a less powerful representative â€” compared the impeachment proceedings to a lynching at least three times, according to the Washington Post, each time referring to his Republican colleagues as a â€œlynch mob.â€
Reps. Danny Davis and Gregory Meeks â€” both men who, in their younger years, could have been targets of actual lynch mobs â€” called the Clinton proceedings a â€œlynchingâ€ on the floor of the House.
Many of these men have since apologized; Meeks has argued he had every right to use the word.
â€œContext matters,â€ Meeks told the Post. â€œThere is a difference when that word is used by someone of my experience and perspective, whose relatives were the targets of lynch mobs, compared to a president who has dog-whistled to white nationalists and peddled racism.â€
Biden, who is not a black man, was more straightforward: â€œThis wasnâ€™t the right word to use and Iâ€™m sorry about that,â€ he tweeted Tuesday evening.
Democrats who used the word flippantly in 1998 may not have been criticized at the time, but, like the president, they are being censured now. Unlike the president, they have for the most part apologized.
And though impeachment proceedings have been described as lynchings in the past, that doesnâ€™t make doing so right. Lynching referred to the same base act in 1998 that it refers to now.
The brutality contained in the word was brought up by House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn in his response to Trumpâ€™s tweet. Clyburn, who like many lawmakers was a youth during the period in which lynchings are believed to have been at their zenith, said on CNN: â€œIâ€™m a product of the South. I know the history of that word. That is a word that we ought to be very, very careful about using.â€
A brief history of actual lynchings
The Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) notes that people of any race could be â€” and were â€” lynched. The earliest form of the practice was used in places that lacked formal legal structures, like in settlements in the American West, where lynchings were used to punish legal infractions (and didnâ€™t always mean death).
Today, however, the word lynching is linked to extrajudicial killings animated by racism of the sort seen throughout the South and West in the period following the Civil War.
NAACP research found 4,743 lynchings occurred in the US between 1882 and 1968; the vast majority of those â€” 3,446 â€” were lynchings of black Americans.
During this period, lynching could occur at any time for any reason.
An EJI analysis found that 25 percent of the lynchings it studied were carried out following some allegation of rape; 30 percent were committed after an accusation of murder. These accusations were rarely investigated; and the killings were often committed before any legal proceedings could be held, and were sometimes done in the face of evidence suggesting the lynched person was innocent.
Peter Bazemore was accused of rape in 1918; he was lynched before an investigation revealed the rapist was a white man in blackface. When a judge granted a stay of execution against Edward Johnson, a black man accused of rape, in 1906, he was taken from jail, hanged and shot, and left with a note reading, â€œTo Justice Harlan. Come get your nigger now.â€ Johnson maintained he was innocent, and was eventually found to be.

Those who defended black Americans against these sorts of lynchings placed themselves in danger. Journalist Ida B. Wells, who rebutted stereotypes of sexual violence perpetrated by black men, had her office burned down and was threatened with lynching herself.
Lynchings were also used to control populaces of color, forcing them to bend to racist power structures and ensuring limited paths to economic and political development.
In practice, this meant a person could be lynched for any reason. Charles Lewis was lynched in 1918 for refusing to empty the pockets of his Army uniform. Richard Wilkerson was lynched in 1934 for defending a black woman who had been assaulted by a white man at a dance. Sam Gates was lynched in 1917 for being â€œannoying.â€
The terror inherent in this uncertainty was reinforced by lynchings as a public spectacle at which refreshments were served and white citizens were encouraged to take direct part in torture â€” for instance, the 1904 lynching of Luther Holbert and his wife during which the crowd cut off pieces of their â€œquivering fleshâ€ while they were still alive. As the incisions were made, the crowd drank lemonade and whiskey and bought snacks.
At other lynchings, fingers and teeth and even pieces of skin were taken as grisly mementos that were openly displayed after the murder was over. Bodies were left in strategic locations to terrify black populations â€” the head of Ell Persons was placed in Memphis, Tennesseeâ€™s black business district as a warning.
Such lynchings were not limited to the South. In 1922, Elias Villareal Zarate, a man of Mexican descent, was lynched in Texas after being accused of fighting with a white coworker. Texas Rangers and US soldiers killed 15 Latin Americans one night in 1918, accusing them of being thieves. Antonio RodrÃ­guez was lynched in Texas in 1910, burned alive. A night of lynching in Los Angeles in 1871 saw 10 percent of that cityâ€™s Chinese population at the time killed. As with the lynchings of black Americans in the South, these Western lynchings also drew large crowds, and saw affected populations forced to limit their engagement in life in order to shield themselves from the ever present threat of death.
The federal government has guidelines for dealing with impeachment. It has no laws on lynching.
Murder is, of course, against the law. But federal murder laws did little to protect the thousands of people of color lynched during the period of Reconstruction and the years leading up to the civil rights movement. And it goes without saying federal and local statutes did nothing to protect slaves from being lynched â€” the only systematic protection that population had from lynching was economic.
And few of those responsible for lynching ever faced any legal consequences for their actions. EJI found 1 percent of all lynching perpetrators were convicted of a crime (for lynchings after 1900).
Some states passed anti-lynching laws, but they were roundly ignored, and federal efforts to pass anti-lynching legislation in the House of Representatives went nowhere, as Voxâ€™s P.R. Lockhart has explained:
Efforts to pass anti-lynching legislation date back to 1900, when North Carolina Rep. George H. White, the only black man in Congress at the time, introduced a measure that was defeated in committee. The first serious congressional effort to pass anti-lynching legislation began in 1918, when Rep. Leonidas Dyer, a Missouri Republican, introduced the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which called for the federal government â€œto prosecute lynch mobs for murder,â€ according to the Los Angeles Times.
Dyer introduced the bill at each subsequent session, and in 1922, the bill passed the House only to be filibustered in the Senate. In 1928, Dyer outlined the constitutional case for his anti-lynching legislation and argued that his bill protected the equal protection rights granted to African Americans under the 14th Amendment. â€œThere has been and is now a two-fold denial of the equal protection of the law resulting from the existence of the lynching evil: the failure to afford protection to the victim, and the failure to prosecute the guilty parties,â€ Dyer wrote.
After the 1922 filibuster, Dyerâ€™s bill would remain untouched by Congress for years until it was reintroduced in 1930. But as the Great Depression continued, legislators would set the issue aside.
Legislation on the issue did not succeed until 2018, when Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Tim Scott â€” the only three black senators in Congress â€” introduced the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018. Harris was also one of the many lawmakers who condemned Trumpâ€™s tweet, writing on Twitter, â€œLynching is a reprehensible stain on this nationâ€™s history, as is this President.â€
The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act passed the Senate in 2018; companion legislation introduced by Rush, the former Black Panther who pointedly criticized Trumpâ€™s lynching tweet, has not passed the House.
Nor has it been taken up by the president. By advocating for the act, as he did criminal justice reform, Trump could help give the US a federal anti-lynching law for the first time in its history.
Instead, however, he used his first tweet about lynching to complain that he is being lynched by an impeachment inquiry.
Despite Grahamâ€™s characterization of this inquiry as lawless, it is not. Impeachment is governed by a process described in the Constitution, which states a president may be impeached for â€œtreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.â€ That document also spells out guidelines for the impeachment process â€” namely, that it starts in the House of Representatives and is concluded in the Senate. And so far, the House has followed what is spelled out in the Constitution and established practice.
The federal government has ways to deal with suspected lawbreaking by a president. The Constitution and federal law do not have ways of addressing lynching, however, despite it having been a method of killing favored by Americans for generations.
It is true there is little fear of lynchings currently, and this is perhaps why Trump felt it appropriate to use the word to describe the impeachment process â€” for many, it may seem a thing of the past. But the fact so many Americans were murdered through lynching, the fact it was used to as a terror tactic to promote an ideology of hatred, and the fact no federal anti-lynching law exists makes the presidentâ€™s use of the word completely inappropriate at best.
The power of the word remains, and even if there is minimal threat of lynchings now, the incident serves as a reminder of history and as a new opportunity to correct a gap in federal law.

"Part of Issue #7 of The Highlight, our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.
Natalie Grams once believed in homeopathy. She believed that sugar pastilles, distilled and diluted as the praxis of homeopathy prescribes, could treat ailments from colds and flus to depression and anxiety, to allergies, asthma, chronic pain, immune dysfunction, and digestive disorders â€” you name it.
As a medical student in her native Germany, sheâ€™d become increasingly frustrated with the limitations of conventional medicine. There was no time, the 41-year-old physician says, to really care about patients; treating symptoms was the bottom line. Then, in the midst of her studies, she survived a horrific car accident. She escaped mostly unscathed, but soon suffered repeated fainting spells. Doctors could find nothing wrong. A friend suggested she try a naturopath, a practitioner of alternative medicine, who diagnosed Grams with PTSD, and prescribed a homeopathic remedy â€” specifically, Belladonna C200, tiny, white pills featuring a diluted form of the poisonous plant by the same name.
â€œAnd then I felt better,â€ says Grams. â€œSo I thought, â€˜Oh, it was homeopathy that healed me, that cured my symptoms.â€™â€
Homeopathy is a school of alternative medicine based on the principles that â€œlike cures like,â€ that less is more, that a detailed patient intake is necessary to get to the root of a medical issue. After she recovered, Grams devoted herself to it, not only as a patient, but as a practitioner. She first completed her medical training, and then, after seven years of homeopathic training, including 300 hours of coursework that cost her a not-insignificant sum (weekend trainings were as much as 300 euros, or more than $300), Grams became a licensed medical homeopath. And she opened her own practice.
Much of her homeopathic training ran counter to what sheâ€™d studied in med school. Instructors taught that vaccinations contained chemical ingredients like aluminum, and that antibiotics canâ€™t cure disease, recalls Grams. One supervisor stripped away all conventional remedies for most patients he saw, even those with chronic illnesses requiring medication, like high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma. Grams, though, was all in.
And, as is something of a time-honored tradition in homeopathy, she contended with skeptics and critics. To prove them wrong, she began writing a book in defense of homeopathy.
Instead, she found that the facts and research didnâ€™t support the field sheâ€™d built her career on. She read up on clinical trial after clinical trial that could find no hard evidence that homeopathic remedies worked; she consulted chemists and physicists, who explained why quantum physics canâ€™t support homeopathyâ€™s claim that water retains â€œthe memoryâ€ of any substance it comes into contact with; she turned to psychologists, who talked in-depth about the placebo effect. The result was a very different book that she titled Homeopathy Reconsidered.
â€œI was convinced [I was] doing something good, really good,â€ she says of her homeopathic practice over FaceTime while on vacation with her family at an undisclosed location. (Sheâ€™s lived â€œhidden,â€ as she puts it, since she became a public critic of homeopathy and the death threats began.) â€œEven perhaps the best form of medicine.â€
Homeopathic remedies contain no discernible molecules of their â€œactiveâ€ ingredients. And yet, proponents claim they retain the properties of what isnâ€™t there. â€œItâ€™s like smoke,â€ says Grams, â€œlike something that if you want to grab it, if you want to get ahold of it, it just vanishes. Itâ€™s just a big illusion.â€
Homeopathy is a $1.2 billion industry in the US alone, used by an estimated 5 million adults and 1 million kids. Itâ€™s become such a staple of Americaâ€™s wellness industry that leading brands such as Boiron and Hylandâ€™s are readily available at high-end health-focused chains like Whole Foods and Sprouts, supermarkets like Ralphs, and superstores such as Walmart. Analysts project that the global homeopathic market will grow 12.5 percent by 2023.
Once considered fringe, homeopathy is now bundled by conventional medicine under the banner of â€œcomplementary and alternative medicine,â€ with the other usual suspects of the Westâ€™s modern wellness movement, a health wave that swelled in the 1970s and crested twenty years later: acupuncture, massage, meditation, yoga, reiki, Ayurveda, etc. â€œBack in the 1990s,â€ writes Jennie Rothenberg Gritz at the Atlantic, â€œthe word â€˜alternativeâ€™ was a synonym for hip and forward-thinking.â€ Today, about half of adults in the US say theyâ€™ve tried alternative medicine.
â€œItâ€™s like smoke, like something that if you want to grab it, if you want to get ahold of it, it just vanishes.â€
For those who buy into it, homeopathy is synonymous with holistic health. Surely there are more answers out there, more remedies, homeopaths argue, than ibuprofen, antacids, statins, SSRIs, and surgery. Its rise has been in tandem with a growing sense of perceived failures in medicine, particularly that doctors fail to take â€œwhole healthâ€ into consideration. To its followers, homeopathy does.
But these products are not FDA-approved. In 2016, the Federal Trade Commission began a crackdown on the homeopathic remedies that were filling grocery shelves, mandating that they clearly state that they are not, in fact, medicine. Boironâ€™s website now bears that legally required disclaimer: â€œClaims based on traditional homeopathic practice, not accepted medical evidence.â€
Consumers are beginning to feel â€œscammed and cheated,â€ the nonprofit Center for Inquiry argued, in a lawsuit filed last month against Walmart and CVS over the sale of what it called â€œhomeopathic fake medicine.â€ A consumer survey conducted by the nonprofit found that 41 percent of respondents felt negatively about homeopathic remedies â€œ[o]nce [they] were told the essential facts about homeopathyâ€™s pseudoscientific claims.â€
In a statement provided to Vox, Boironâ€™s chief executive and president Janick Boudazin wrote, â€œWe do not comment on ongoing cases or cases of others. It should be clarified, however, that homeopathic drug products are legally marketed in the United States, ensuring consumers have access to safe and clearly identified homeopathic products from which to choose for their healthcare needs.â€
Peter Gold, a spokesperson for the American Institute of Homeopathy, cited several studies, including a controversial one from the Swiss government, that he said proved homeopathyâ€™s efficacy. â€œNinety percent of available clinical studies would have to be ignored in order to conclude that homeopathy has no effects,â€ he said in an emailed statement. â€œHomeopathy is an important element of an Integrative Medicine, combining the best from conventional medicine and medical homeopathy for the benefit of patients.â€
Requests for comment from another leading homeopathy organization â€” the National Center for Homeopathy â€” went unanswered by the time of publication.
A history of homeopathy, distilled
Many misidentify homeopathy as â€œnaturalâ€ and describe it as plant-based or herbal medicine. Itâ€™s not. In his 2016 book, Homeopathy: The Undiluted Facts, Edzard Ernst, a physician, homeopathy researcher, and noted skeptic, classified the â€œnaturalâ€ qualifier as one of the many myths about homeopathy disseminated by both believers and skeptics. But thereâ€™s â€œnothing naturalâ€ about it, he wrote: Homeopathic remedies include alcohol exposed to x-rays to minimize the effects of radiation therapy, and fragments of the original Berlin Wall to â€œcure a patientâ€™s communication problems,â€ Ernst wrote.
Homeopathy isnâ€™t Eastern medicine either. Itâ€™s slightly more than 200 years old, and it was born in Germany.
Samuel Hahnemann, an 18th-century physician described by Ernst as a â€œdeeply religious and spiritual man as well as an eccentric, innovator, maverick, and polymath,â€ first published a new school of medical thought that he named homeopathy in 1790. Heâ€™d become disillusioned with the medical model of the time, but was fascinated by cinchona bark powder, then used to treat malaria (and later found to contain the alkaloid quinine, which is still used to treat malaria today). He dosed himself with large quantities of cinchona bark, ingesting it repeatedly to document the fever, sweats, and nausea that set in. His aim: to test whether the remedy for malaria produced the symptoms of malaria in a healthy person. It did.
Hahnemann declared this the first of what would come to be known as â€œhomeopathic provings.â€ (The etymology of the word â€œhomeopathyâ€ is â€œlike disease.â€) He conducted more experiments and reached more provings. Soon, he defined several so-called laws; two are guiding principles of homeopathy today:
Like cures like: Homeopathy posits that a substance that produces a diseaseâ€™s symptoms in a healthy person is a cure for that disease. (In the case of the aforementioned 20th-century remedy known simply as â€œBerlin Wall,â€ conditions caused by communication problems are said to be cured by tablets made from finely ground, diluted shards of the actual Berlin Wall, because it was once a concrete barrier to communication.)
Law of minimum dose: The lower the dose, say homeopathic practitioners, the more potent the remedy. To that end, homeopathic remedies are extremely diluted. Many are so diluted, in fact, that they contain no detectable molecules of the â€œmother tincture.â€ Hahnemann intended to avoid poisoning, as many of the substances that he introduced as remedies were toxic. But soon his rationale became less, well, rational: â€œVital energyâ€ was transmitted during dilution, Hahnemann believed, so none of the original substance needed to remain.
Hahnemannâ€™s theories represented a sea change in medical philosophy, a rejection of what he coined â€œallopathyâ€ â€” remedies that produce a diseaseâ€™s opposite symptoms â€” and derisively dubbed â€œschool medicine.â€ Hahnemann thought that doctors of his day harmed patients, and he wasnâ€™t wrong. Late 18th century medicine revolved around balancing the four humors, most frequently through bloodletting. Homeopathyâ€™s less-invasive approach attracted followers, who in turn spread Hahnemannâ€™s gospel across Europe, India, and the US. The American Institute of Homeopathy, founded in 1844, even arrived three years before the American Medical Association.
Conventional medicine eventually became increasingly science-oriented, discarding bloodletting and the like for more effective (and drastically less dangerous) treatments. Homeopathy, by contrast, maintained its original dogma, one that hinged on individualized treatment and made it nearly impossible to conduct clinical trials that adhered to the scientific method.
By the 1900s, homeopathy was even recognized by the US government. Royal Copeland, a surgeon, New York City commissioner of health, storied US senator, and homeopath, used his medical authority to lend credibility to homeopathy and his political influence to ensure its recognition by the law. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 oversees homeopathy to this day.
From â€œalternative medicineâ€ to complementary medicine
In the world of homeopathy, there are believers, and there are skeptics. There are also passive participants who seek over-the-counter remedies as supplements, believing in these pastilles (and ointments, tinctures, tablets, creams) enough to buy them, if not necessarily to stake their health on them entirely. There are those who believe in invisible forces, in energies, in spirits; there are those who donâ€™t, who dismiss homeopathic remedies as alcoholic sugar water. And some perspectives, like Gramsâ€™s, fluctuate over time.
Boiron was the homeopathic brand of choice for my Southern California family in the 1990s and early 2000s. I grew up in the suburbs, my dad is a doctor, and my parents fully vaccinated me, but there was something about â€œnatural medicine,â€ and homeopathy in particular, that spoke to them. Whenever I had the flu, my mom gave me a pinky-sized vial of Oscillococcinum, sweet â€œflu crystals,â€ as we called them, that I dissolved happily under my tongue. Whenever I had a cold, she gave me something called ColdCalm, which I took, but begrudged for its chalky taste and easily crumpled blister packs.
I know now that the active ingredient in Oscillococcinum is Anas barbariae, extract of duck heart and liver. (The Center for Inquiry asked consumers about their knowledge base of Anas barbariae as part of their aforementioned survey; 46 percent of respondents â€œviewed the product less favorablyâ€ once they learned about this duck stuff.) I donâ€™t know if it worked. My symptoms would eventually abate, but I donâ€™t know that my conditions improved any quicker with the remedy than without. I do know, however, that my parents searched beyond the confines of conventional medicine for ways to improve our health that were more â€œnaturalâ€ than prescription drugs and standard over-the-counters, or that seemed more natural anyway â€” and theyâ€™re not alone.
As alternative treatments become immersed in mainstream consumer culture (see again: Whole Foods, worth $13.7 billion as of 2017), thereâ€™s been a semantics shift, away from â€œalternativeâ€ to â€œintegrated.â€ To wit, the National Institutes of Health renamed its alternative health-focused department the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health in 2015.
â€œThe name change really reflects our deep-seated interest in studying complementary and integrative health as part of conventional care, and not as an alternative to conventional care,â€ says NCCIH Deputy Director David Shurtleff. He uses cancer as an example: There is no known alternative cancer treatment thatâ€™s proven effective, but the research supports that alternative treatments can ease common cancer symptoms, such as yoga for anxiety and depression or mindfulness for insomnia.
For supplemental users, homeopathy is an alternative medicine, another option in the medicine cabinet. Critics see all homeopathic use as an alternative to medicine. Itâ€™s a subtle, but important, distinction. To the criticsâ€™ point, consider this statistic from Pew Research Center: One in five adults in the US uses alternative medicine instead of conventional medicine.
For Grams, this is the biggest risk â€” that people will forgo conventional, proven treatments in favor of homeopathic remedies which, she says, are nothing more than sugar pills. â€œYou might think, â€˜Oh, if that remedy doesnâ€™t help me, Iâ€™ll use another, Iâ€™ll use another.â€™ And you lose time. If you have cancer, time is life.â€
In the shadows of mainstream medicineâ€™s failures
Doug Brown was happy in his practice as a family nurse practitioner, for a time. Eventually, however, ambivalence about modern medicine set in. â€œAs I became more aware that so many of my chronically ill patients were not really getting better,â€ says Brown, 62, â€œthat I was managing their illnesses, often by ordering lots of lab tests and adding more and more medications, I began to question what I was doing.â€
His path to homeopathy followed a familiar script: disillusionment with conventional medicine, a sense of desperation and yearning for what Brown describes as â€œsomething â€˜more.â€™â€ After his 2-year-old sonâ€™s ear infection resisted two courses of antibiotics, Brown â€” who had spent over a decade prescribing pharmaceutical drugs to his patients â€” turned to homeopathy. The belladonna remedy, says Brown, cured his sonâ€™s infection.
â€œIt seemed to me like a miracle,â€ Brown says from his office in Portland, Oregon, where heâ€™s practiced homeopathic healing for almost 20 years. â€œAnd then when I saw it work on other people, I began to realize that homeopathy held the key to this missing link that I was intuitively searching for in all my years of doing conventional medicine.â€

The people who turn to homeopathy are a subset of a larger wellness-focused demographic that tend to be female, young to middle age, non-smokers, with lower body mass indexes, who make healthy lifestyle decisions (diet, exercise, supplements, you get it). â€œPeople who use homeopathy have that same profile, but even more so,â€ says Michelle Dossett, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who has studied homeopathy usage and published on her national survey findings in the American Journal of Public Health in 2015.
At the same time, thereâ€™s a subset of this population of homeopathy seekers that holds a low perception of mainstream medicine. Conventional medicine, they feel, is failing.
â€œI think thereâ€™s a big disconnect between what conventional medicine aspires to do and what actually happens sometimes in the consultation room,â€ says Dossett. â€œBecause physicians face incredible pressures these days.â€ A 2017 study found that doctors in the US spend around 20 minutes with their patients, reports Reuters. (Even worse: Primary care consultations last just 5 minutes for half the worldâ€™s population.) Itâ€™s not for lack of trying. Doctorsâ€™ schedules are typically stacked, and wait times are typically long, with the Physician Foundationâ€™s 2017 Patient Survey Report finding that only 11 percent of patients and 14 percent of primary care physicians feel â€œthat they have all the time they need together.â€
Most attitudes toward modern medicine are positive. Pew Research Center found in 2017 that more than two-thirds of Americans visited a health care provider in the previous year, with nearly 90 percent of that cohort feeling that they were listened to and 84 percent feeling that their provider â€œreally caredâ€ about their health. But the remainder, albeit a comparatively small sliver of the pie, shouldnâ€™t be overlooked. Misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses may be one reason for their dissatisfaction: According to health care journal BMJ Quality & Safety, 12 million American adults â€” around 5 percent of the US adult population â€” are misdiagnosed every year.
â€œWe have sort of an industrial medical system that really isnâ€™t serving patients, and isnâ€™t serving the health care professionals who are trying to serve patients,â€ says Dossett, who adds that many homeopathic practitioners, on the other hand, tend to spend more time with their patients.
They also spend more time exploring aspects of a patientâ€™s health that might not be immediately tied to the reason theyâ€™ve made an appointment, the â€œchief complaintâ€ or â€œpresenting problemâ€ in medicalese. Homeopathy is decidedly more comprehensive, exhaustive even, in its tack, from the inside out, and top to bottom. â€œHomeopathy is holistic because it treats the person as a whole, rather than focusing on a diseased part or a labeled sickness,â€ reads AIHâ€™s description of homeopathic medicine, adding that the practice â€œstimulates the personâ€™s own healing powerâ€ â€” a.k.a., invisible energy within every individual that Hahnemann termed â€œvital force.â€
In homeopathyâ€™s doctrine, mental, emotional, and social considerations are just as important as what X-rays, imaging, and lab tests can reveal, explains Brown: â€œWhat the mind expresses, the body expresses.â€ This is not to suggest that illnesses are psychosomatic, he adds, but more an issue of trusting patients at their word.
The trouble with homeopathic self-medicating
Buying homeopathic remedies at Walmart and the like, homeopaths would like you to know, isnâ€™t real homeopathy. Dossettâ€™s research found that most people in the US who use homeopathy self-prescribe OTC remedies, as my family did with Oscillococcinum and ColdCalm; only 19 percent of American homeopathic users see a homeopathic provider.
â€œItâ€™s very unlikely that the remedies at a Whole Foods dispensary [are] going to be what the patient needs,â€ says Brown. There are more than 4,000 remedies available today, he adds, while at any given store, there may be about 10 on the shelves (none of them â€œBerlin Wallâ€). â€œIâ€™m certainly not in favor of restricting that, but I want people to understand that homeopathy isnâ€™t just the remedies, or just taking remedies,â€ continues Brown. â€œIt is a process of becoming conscious of oneâ€™s experiences.â€
Hahnemann believed homeopathy to be the only true medicine. He called the homeopath who combined his teachings and practices with conventional medicine â€œan apostate and a traitor,â€ according to Ernst. (Gold, of the American Institute of Homeopathy, dismissed Ernst, writing that â€œhis work lacks the rigor one should expect from serious research.â€) He would hate the supporting role that homeopathyâ€™s been cast under the complementary and integrated health umbrella.
Todayâ€™s homeopathic practitioners often train in conventional medicine as MDs (like Grams) or nurse practitioners (like Brown), and largely recommend seeing general practitioners and primary care physicians concurrently, and getting X-rays and imaging and lab tests done. â€œNothing can be a substitute for what modern medicine can offer in critical, life-threatening situations,â€ says Brown. â€œThatâ€™s not to say that homeopathy doesnâ€™t have a role.â€
â€œIt is a process of becoming conscious of oneâ€™s experiences.â€
When asked whether its line of homeopathic remedies should be considered supplements to conventional medicine, or substitutes, Boironâ€™s CEO Boudazin wrote to Vox: â€œHomeopathic medicines are one of the safest choices for self-treatment of everyday conditions like cold and flu symptoms, allergies, and muscle pain. They are often a first line of treatment that can offer relief with a low risk of side effects when used as directed. There are no known interactions with conventional medications or herbal supplements, allowing users to complement other treatments as well.â€
Can â€œharmlessâ€ homeopathy become harmful to society?
Thereâ€™s not going to be a meeting of the minds on this one. Devotees say that homeopathy works. Critics say that any perceived benefit is the work of the placebo effect. Devotees counter with success stories among animals and kids. (Ernst reported that Prince Charles wrote of his homeopathically treated animals: â€œ[Homeopathy] is not the quackery they claim it to be. Or if it is, then I have some very clever cows in my shed!â€) Critics counter that counter, asking, well, what about placebo by proxy?
â€œSo much of conventional medicine actually could be legitimately criticized as exercises in the nocebo effect,â€ Brown says. The nocebo effect is the phenomenon where a diagnosis, pill, or treatment provokes negative symptoms associated with that diagnosis, pill, or treatment in the patient. Tell someone they have three months to live, and kill their hope, and the prophecy may very well come true. Brown adds, â€œOur conscious attitude and our conscious expectations do have a profound effect on our patients.â€
The old evidence versus feelings debate can be a dangerous one, though, particularly when taken to its extreme. (See: Trump supporters.) And to that end, with more than 1,090 people in the US contracting measles this year alone, with the US at risk to lose its measles-free status after the measles vaccine eliminated measles just 19 years ago, and with the number of unvaccinated kids in the US quadrupling since 2001, we need to talk about anti-vaxxers.
Vaccinations might appear to follow the same â€œlike cures likeâ€ logic as homeopathic remedies, and they do, to a degree; vaccinations, however, contain measurable quantities of their active ingredients. And to be clear, anti-vaxxer ideology is by no means intrinsically part of homeopathic philosophy, or prescribed by homeopathy dogma. â€œYou will find some homeopathic providers who will recommend modifications to [the] vaccination schedule, but itâ€™s not something that becomes part and parcel of homeopathy,â€ says Dossett.
Still, there is some overlap between individuals who eschew conventional treatments in favor of homeopathic remedies and individuals who forgo vaccinations in favor of homeopathic substitutes.
â€œImmunizations are a controversial subject,â€ reads a 2004 blog post from the National Center for Homeopathy, which appears at the top of the siteâ€™s search results for â€˜vaccinationsâ€™ and â€˜immunizations.â€™ â€œBefore making decisions about them, itâ€™s best to arm yourself with information from many different sources.â€ Four of the five homeopaths interviewed in the post appear to condone the â€œchoiceâ€ to not vaccinate, though not necessarily the decision itself.
Concern about this potential overlap is great enough that NCCIH includes a warning box on its homeopathy info page titled, â€œNo Evidence To Support Homeopathic Immunizations.â€
What homeopathy can teach conventional medicine
There is a swath of middle ground in the great believers/skeptics debate swirling around homeopathy, and itâ€™s this: empathy.
â€œThereâ€™s so much scorn, and so much ridicule, that it creates a tremendous block,â€ reflects Brown of negative attitudes toward homeopathy. â€œAnd to me that is very, very sad.â€ Heâ€™s sick of seeing homeopathy labeled as â€œpseudoscience,â€ or â€œquackery,â€ or a â€œscam.â€ His lived experience, and his homeopathic practice, tells him otherwise.
â€œWhat is it about homeopathy that patients value?â€ asks a German study published in 2013 in Quality in Primary Care. â€œAnd what can family medicine learn from this?â€ The study singles out empathy as key to establishing positive patient-physician relationships, and to achieving positive patient outcomes. Homeopaths listen to their patients. They believe their patients. Individualization is the most basic driver of their medical philosophy.
Conventional medicine, this argument contends, could stand to take a page from homeopathyâ€™s book, and trust more in what their patients feel to be true. Doing so could be the key to bridging the gap between conventional and alternative, for medicine that is truly holistic and integrated.
Grams left homeopathy behind her, but she still believes in one of its tenets: the power of self-healing. â€œOur self-healing powers are enormous,â€ she says. â€œThe patients I treated in my [homeopathy practice], many of them got better. It was not due to homeopathy, but because of their self-healing. And I think we can have more awareness for that power, that itâ€™s really in us.â€

"WeWork, the coworking unicorn startup whose IPO had been one of the most highly anticipated public offerings of 2019, has mostly imploded.
The companyâ€™s largest investor, SoftBank, is taking control of the struggling company, per the Wall Street Journal, infusing the cash-strapped firm with a rescue funding package. The deal values the company at $8 billion â€” a small fraction of WeWorkâ€™s peak valuation of nearly $50 billion earlier this year. Reportedly, WeWork is so short on funds that it had to delay laying off its staff because it couldnâ€™t pay their severance packages.
The deal also cuts off most ties between the company and its former CEO and founder Adam Neumann, who will give up most of his stock in the company in exchange for nearly $1.7 billion, including a $185 million consulting fee, per the Journalâ€™s report.
Last month, Neumann said he was stepping down after pressure from some of the companyâ€™s board members, including officials representing SoftBank. It was an extraordinary fall for a founder who until recently seemed to be on the cusp of taking a nearly $50 billion company public.
Right before Neumannâ€™s departure, the company, which had been about to begin its roadshow to get public investors interested in buying its shares, postponed its IPO in a highly unusual move after investors expressed concern about its business model and leadership structure. The company also announced that it was pulling its IPO filing document (the S-1 registration statement) with the SEC.
â€œWe have decided to postpone our IPO to focus on our core business, the fundamentals of which remain strong,â€ wrote company co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham in a joint statement in September.
While itâ€™s unclear what the exact number will be, WeWork will lay off a large portion of its staff. The Information reported last month that could be as much as one-third of its total workforce.
When Neumann stepped down as CEO last month, the company announced that Artie Minson, formerly co-president and chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, formerly vice chairman, would take over as co-CEOs. At the time, the pair said it would â€œbe taking clear actions to balance WeWorkâ€™s high growth, profitability and unique member experience while also evaluating the optimal timing for an IPO.â€
Now, the new co-CEOs will reportedly step down and SoftBank is set to start a search for a new CEO, according to Axios.
In the months and even years leading up to WeWorkâ€™s IPO push, concerns abounded about its massive losses, whether itâ€™s really a tech company, and its hard-partying corporate culture. But investors seemed to be fine with WeWorkâ€™s many problems â€” until it registered to trade on the public markets. Suddenly the companyâ€™s insider dealings (like being both its own landlord and tenant), its track record of burning cash without a path to profitability, and reports of poor executive judgment seemed to become an issue.
The abrupt drop in WeWorkâ€™s valuation probably had something to do with it. WeWork declined to comment to Recode on the matter. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SoftBank, a Japanese telecom giant whose $100 billion Vision Fund investment arm has flooded Silicon Valley with money and transformed the industryâ€™s finances, first invested in WeWork in 2017. It now owns nearly a third of the company.
Masayoshi Son, chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group Corp, has in the past called WeWork his â€œnext Alibaba,â€ referring to the highly profitable investments heâ€™d made in the Chinese tech behemoth. At one point, SoftBank wanted to be WeWorkâ€™s majority stakeholder, a plan it scrapped at the beginning of the year due to market turbulence and opposition from its investors â€” probably an early sign that SoftBank backers were uncomfortable tying its finances so closely to such a chaotic company.
But its investors had known about most of WeWorkâ€™s problems for a while.
â€œItâ€™s one thing for people to know, but when youâ€™re visiting with potential investors and they raise all these questions, thatâ€™s where the rubber hits the road,â€ Amy Borrus, deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors, told Recode. â€œIt turns out a lot of investors had pointed questions as to how the company was structured, how [Neumann] ran the company, as well as the economic outlook for the company.â€
From the next Alibaba to a financial liability for its biggest investor, hereâ€™s how WeWork got to this point.
Poor corporate governance
WeWorkâ€™s corporate governance issues are myriad, and the companyâ€™s corporate structure is at the root of it all. Like many other tech companies that have recently gone public, WeWork had a multi-class stock structure that gave Neumann more power than the companyâ€™s other stockholders.
Neumann had been able to maintain control of WeWork because the Class B and Class C shares he owned each had 20 votes to every one vote regular shareholders would get for their Class A shares. After a wave of criticism, WeWork amended its S-1 and limited Neumannâ€™s super-voting shares to 10 votes for every one regular shareâ€™s voting power â€” still a high ratio. Bloomberg reported that following his resignation, Neumannâ€™s shares were worth three votes. As part of the bailout, We stock now all has the same voting power, the Wall Street Journal reports, saying Neumannâ€™s stake in the company will decline to below 10 percent.
With the previous multi-class stock, it would have been hard to get rid of Neumann if he didnâ€™t want to leave since his super votes still gave him the power to fire the entire board. But if Neumann did get rid of his opponents on the board, he would have run the risk of making WeWork look even more chaotic than it already was in the eyes of investors, threatening the outcome of an IPO.
Original company filings stated that if he died, his wife Rebekah, the co-founder and the chief brand and impact officer of WeWork, would have been charged with appointing a successor. The updates to WeWorkâ€™s S-1 changed that Game of Thrones scenario to one in which the WeWork board would be responsible for finding the next CEO in the event of Neumannâ€™s death.
Rebekah is one of several family members employed at WeWork, including Neumannâ€™s brother-in-law, who served as its â€œhead of wellness.â€
Neumannâ€™s board supremacy allowed him to enact a number of nonstandard financial practices that many have viewed as a conflict of interest.
WeWork, which at its heart is a company that leases long-term office space in order to rent it to others in the short term, didnâ€™t initially plan to own property. Not doing so saved it from larger expenses that would burden its already laden balance sheet. But earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that Neumann was privately buying property that he then leased to WeWork.
And at the same time, Neumann was borrowing money from WeWork at little to no interest. So the company was paying him rent while lending him money.
Responding in part to investorsâ€™ concerns, Neumann said he would transfer ownership of these buildings to the companyâ€™s real estate investment vehicle, ARK.
In a similar vein, WeWork paid Neumann nearly $6 million to change its name to â€œThe We Company,â€ a trademark that Neumann owned. In the mea culpa/updated S-1, he gave that money back.
Neumann reportedly cashed out of $700 million in stock ahead of the IPO â€” the S-1 pegs his last stock sale to â€œlate 2017â€ â€” which isnâ€™t a good look for a CEO trying to convince others that they should buy the stock.
The company has also attracted public scrutiny for, until recently, having no women on its board. WeWork finally appointed its first female board member in September.
Struggling finances
Itâ€™s no secret that WeWork is, for now at least, a money-losing business. It lost $1.6 billion on $1.8 billion in revenue last year.
But thatâ€™s par for the course when it comes to technology startups, which WeWork has tried really hard to convince the world that it is. Its ability to burn money surely makes it seem like a tech company â€” even if it doesnâ€™t have other important tech company qualities, like low growth costs and a network effect, meaning the value of its product increases when more people use it.
The companyâ€™s expectations have changed even since its initial IPO filings in August. The companyâ€™s updated S-1 in September got rid of numerous references to â€œbreak-even,â€ â€œprofitable,â€ and â€œcash flowâ€ â€” suggesting those goals are further off than expected.
And WeWorkâ€™s operating losses, whatâ€™s left after the costs to bring in revenue, are marching in lockstep with its growing revenue. This means that the more money WeWork makes, the more it loses. Ideally, youâ€™d want to see the opposite: shrinking losses as the company gains more revenue.
Its biggest expense â€” 65 percent of its revenue â€” is renting office space, which makes sense for a real estate company but not for a tech company, where youâ€™d want to be able to rely on savings as you grow.
Of course, much of WeWorkâ€™s losses can be attributed to its breakneck speed of growth. Opening up new locations is expensive and it can take time to see returns.
Presumably, if WeWork stopped expanding, it would curtail its losses. But even that is difficult to know since WeWork hasnâ€™t explained how profitable or not its established locations are.
As the Financial Times wrote in August, â€œ[I]nstead of a neat profit and loss table for mature and growth locations, WeWork calculates a â€˜contribution marginâ€™ â€” the metric formerly known as â€˜community-adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization].â€™ Like any adjusted financial metric, itâ€™s designed to say to investors, â€˜ignore these costs, because they donâ€™t matter to our core economics.â€™â€ (Investors have been widely skeptical of WeWorkâ€™s community-adjusted Ebitda measurement.)
What we do know is that WeWork has lots of debt, including a $702 million bond thatâ€™s due in 2025 and whose price has fallen in the wake of the recent company turmoil. The company also needs a lot more money, and raising it is becoming more and more difficult as its valuation declines.
Other bad behavior and distracting business priorities
Recent allegations that Neumann brought a â€œsizable chunkâ€ of weed on a private jet across international borders (which is illegal) as well as his general â€œunusual exuberance and excess,â€ as first reported in the Wall Street Journal, have reportedly led him to being pushed out of the company.
But for many who have been following WeWork closely, these allegations are nothing new. Theyâ€™re just a few examples from a long list of other liabilities connected to a company culture that some former employees say can be hard-partying and inappropriate.
Since its inception, WeWork has touted a â€œwork hard, party hard,â€ ethos, with an emphasis on the party. One of its biggest early market differentiators in its coworking spaces was that it served free beer on tap (itâ€™s now put a four-beer limit on its bottomless kegs). Some have said this reflects WeWorkâ€™s culture within its own organization and that this has created an undesirable environment, particularly for women.
Last year, former WeWork director Ruby Anaya sued the company because she alleges that colleagues sexually assaulted her at two mandatory work events where alcohol was served. Anaya blamed WeWorkâ€™s leadership for establishing a top-down â€œfrat-boyâ€ culture, claiming that Neumann himself â€œpliedâ€ her with tequila shots in her interview. WeWork has denied Anayaâ€™s allegations and called her a poor performer.
One of the alleged assaults against Anaya took place at WeWorkâ€™s former annual â€œSummer Campâ€ festival-style work retreat â€” where thousands of employees would camp in tents together in bucolic settings like the British countryside, listening to talks from the likes of Deepak Chopra and dancing to live performances from artists like Lorde. WeWork didnâ€™t hold the event this past year.
The company has also made a dizzying list of acquisitions and investments â€” like its $13 million investment in a wave pool company â€” that many have viewed as distractions from WeWorkâ€™s core business (which is still burning through piles of cash). The company has also tried to get into the business of running gyms, co-living apartments, coding camps, and even a school aimed at budding child entrepreneurs, called WeGrow (which it recently announced itâ€™s shutting down).
The company has said its ambition is to create a â€œWeâ€ brand that permeates every aspect of peopleâ€™s lives, but according to the Wall Street Journal, these other endeavors outside of WeWorkâ€™s coworking business have been struggling.

While WeWorkâ€™s drama has reached an inflection point, the company has been a mess for a while. The warning signs were visible but the private market largely ignored them and continued to pour billions of dollars into the company, with SoftBank leading the charge.
More than anything, the current WeWork debacle raises bigger questions about SoftBank and the future health of its Vision Fund, as well as the funding environment for tech startups at large. SoftBankâ€™s other crown jewel, Uber, also went through an executive shake-up in the approach to its IPO when former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick resigned in 2017. But even with new leadership, Uber has struggled on the stock market since going public and recently laid off 8 percent of its workforce.
Whether or not WeWork rebounds from its current woes, those bigger questions will remain."
"Seemingly overnight, California has been forced to confront a grim new reality: Hundreds of thousands of its residents are regularly going to have their power cut off for days at a time so that their electric utilities can avoid starting wildfires.
The problem â€” which I described in detail last week â€” is intrinsic to what the state is trying to do, namely deliver electricity to millions of residents in often mountainous, forested areas growing hotter and dryer every year. There is probably no way for utilities to do that without starting some fires and/or cutting off the power to avoid them. (Southern California Edison is thinking of cutting off power this week.)
But California is doing just about everything to make the problem worse and handle it poorly. Even as global warming extends its droughts, decades of poor forest and land management have made the state a tinderbox. More and more Californians are living in the most remote, fire-prone areas in the state, doing too little to make their houses and communities resilient in the face of fire. Meanwhile, the stateâ€™s biggest utility, PG&E, is a debt-ridden, mismanaged omnishambles currently being chewed over by a bankruptcy court. Covering its enormous maintenance and fire-prevention backlog is going to cause rates to rise even as power becomes less reliable.
It is the proverbial perfect storm, a collision of natureâ€™s wrath and human myopia. There is much blame to spread and much suffering to come.
So what can California do about it? Must it accept having the nationâ€™s highest electricity rates and least reliable electric power? Is this, in fact, the â€œnew normalâ€?
Itâ€™s complicated.
CA
On one hand, as long as the state gets hotter and dryer and people keep pushing the boundary of wilderness, there will be wildfire risk from electricity infrastructure. No amount of forecasting or tree-trimming can eliminate the possibility of high winds blowing electrical lines into dry vegetation and starting fires, not with hundreds of thousands of miles of overhead lines to contend with. The choice between the uncertain but terrible risk of a fire and the certain but manageable risks of a deliberate blackout will likely remain a recurrent feature of electricity management in California, in perpetuity. That much is the new normal.
But California can do better or worse in these conditions. It can grow more resilient and learn to better manage risks. The stateâ€™s fate is still in its own hands.
Confronting its latest electricity crisis will require reform across a number of institutions, policies, and practices. The reforms fall into four broad categories: hardening the grid and improving the fire safety of grid infrastructure; changing housing and land-use policies that encourage people to move outward into fire-prone areas; reforming a dysfunctional and bankrupt PG&E; and making the electricity system more localized through solar panels, batteries, microgrids, and other forms of distributed energy.
Thatâ€™s a lot! In this post, weâ€™ll take a close look at the first three. The fourth, which I consider the only true long-term solution to Californiaâ€™s mess, weâ€™ll save for a post of its own.
There are ways to make the grid less fire-prone, but they are expensive and slow
Californiaâ€™s SB 901, passed late last year, requires all state utilities to submit wildfire mitigation plans. The overwhelming focus of those plans is on reducing wildfire risks around existing grid infrastructure.
One strategy is grid hardening: replacing old transmission towers and power poles with new, stronger, more fire-resistant ones; replacing worn-out parts; updating power lines with synchrophasors and other tech that can help grid operators detect and limit faults more quickly; insulating lines; and using remote and drone sensing to identify far-off problems quickly.
Grid hardening also involves the brute-force problem of inspecting and properly trimming around the stateâ€™s 250,000 miles of overhead power lines. PG&E is responsible for 100,000 miles of those lines, and many of them go through the stateâ€™s most remote regions. It could hire every qualified tree trimmer in the country, and it would still take years to get out from under its â€œvegetation managementâ€ backlog. (Utility line work is not easy; among other things, it is one of the 10 most dangerous jobs in the US.)
Grid hardening can also, in some cases, involve burying power lines. However, while underground lines are certainly safer when it comes to sparking wildfire, they are not entirely safe (earthquakes, animals, and weather can get to them) nor are they suitable in every area. They are also incredibly expensive: According to PG&E, the cost of converting an overhead distribution line to an underground line is about $3 million a mile, more in dense urban areas. Itâ€™s between $1 and $3 million a mile to build them new, depending on the circumstances.
If PG&E buried all its distribution lines, it would have to recoup around $15,000 from every one of its customers. And thatâ€™s just distribution lines. Burying high-voltage transmission lines that travel hundreds of miles through forests and over mountains would be a financial (and environmental) nightmare.
CEC
Where undergrounding does happen, it is slow. PG&E says it will take five years just to do it in Paradise. Fewer than 100 miles a year are undergrounded; at that rate, it will take PG&E 1,000 years to bury them all.
Undergrounding might play a limited role in select locations â€” probably urban locations, for safety and aesthetic reasons, and a few key high-risk long-distance lines â€” but it is far from a silver bullet. (People fascinated by this subject, as many seem to be, can check out this 2012 report from the Edison Electric Institute and PG&Eâ€™s factsheet on it.)
Alongside grid hardening is fire safety. In 2007, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) was blamed for wildfires in San Diego County; investigators found it hadnâ€™t done proper vegetation management. It ultimately paid $2.4 billion to settle lawsuits related to those fires. It wanted to pass on remaining costs, some $379 million, to ratepayers in the form of higher rates, but the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) wouldnâ€™t let it. The case was appealed all the way up to the California Supreme Court, which found against SDG&E. Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court announced that it would not take the case, leaving SDG&E to eat the costs. (This ruling is relevant to how PG&Eâ€™s liability will ultimately be divided up.)
Since 2007, the scare of those lawsuits has prompted SDG&E to spend $1.5 billion upgrading its fire detection and response capabilities. And in its recently announced wildfire mitigation plan, it proposes spending $3 million more on such measures as aggressive grid hardening and vegetation management, improved meteorology with more weather stations, more remote, high-definition cameras for fire-detection, a multi-level community outreach and education program, and a series of community resource centers where people can go when power is shut off to receive information and basic needs. (T&D World â€” yes, there is a T&D world â€” has a great piece on ways to reduce transmission-system wildfire risk. CPUCâ€™s Elizaveta Malashenko also has a good piece rounding up options.)
These are the same basic measures that all of Californiaâ€™s utilities must ultimately take, but SDG&E already has a huge head start, which is one reason its plan has a lower price tag. PG&E says its wildfire mitigation plan will cost $2.3 billion to implement, in part reflecting its much larger and more difficult territory and in part reflecting its decades of delayed upkeep. And even that plan is only a start. Speaking to the Press Democrat, Sonoma County Board of Supervisors Chairman David Rabbitt â€œquestioned whether the new proposal went far enough, noting for example that PG&E plans to harden 150 miles of electrical wires, while Sonoma County alone has over 7,000 miles of PG&E wires.â€
It will take a decade for PG&E to implement its plan to catch up with SDG&E. Meanwhile, it is less than one-third finished with its 2019 tree trimming. For it and for all California utilities, investments in grid hardening and fire safety will be an ongoing affair, not something that is ever completed.
Ultimately, no amount of grid hardening or fire safety can compensate for the fact that Californiaâ€™s forests are now tightly packed with dry dead trees, the result of decades of mismanagement. Cal Fire, the state agency charged with fire safety, is trying to catch up, but it has a long way to go.
Cal Matters
Power lines strung through those forests are going to start wildfires. They can be minimized but not eliminated.
California must reverse the housing crisis thatâ€™s sending people out of cities into remote, forested areas
As I explained in the last post, some of the factors that have increased wildfire risk are out of the hands of power utilities. Most notably, the risk is increased when Californians move to fire-prone areas, receive subsidized insurance, settle in communities with insufficient fire readiness and evacuation plans, build houses from materials vulnerable to fire, and surround those houses with flammable shrubs and trees. Most of those choices are now incentivized by state law and regulation; none are particularly discouraged.
Unless it wants to become a perpetual rolling disaster, California will eventually have to address all parts of its land-use and housing crisis.
First, foremost, and above all, California must build more housing in its cities. When people come to the state, they want to live in cities, near jobs. But incumbent homeowners fight to preserve exclusionary zoning and it becomes next to impossible to build anything, so existing housing stock becomes prohibitively expensive (the median home price in San Francisco recently hit $1.7 million); new development is dominated by small, high-end units; and homelessness increases. Working-class families flee to where they can afford to live, to the suburbs, the exurbs, and eventually out into the undeveloped wilderness, where they bump up against wealthy tech execs with second homes.
The centrifugal force pushing people out of cities must be reversed by both widespread upzoning and aggressive social housing and homelessness policies. Unfortunately, California doesnâ€™t have a great record on this. Earlier this year, a suite of bills backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that would have helped the housing and affordability crises died in Sacramento.
(More promising: a few weeks ago, Newsom signed a bill that would legalize accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on all single-family lots. In Vancouver, British Columbia, a third of single-family homes now have ADUs.)
Speaking of centrifugal force, Prop 13 needs to go. That amendment to the state constitution, passed in 1978, establishes that properties are assessed for property taxes only when they are sold (otherwise property taxes can rise just 2 percent a year). Businesses and homeowners can sit on a building for decades and pay absurdly low property taxes, depriving localities of billions in revenue and pushing them to systemically advantage new development over infill. A ballot measure to repeal the commercial half of Prop 13 is on the ballot in 2020.
Second, insurance rates must eventually be allowed to reflect the true risks of living in fire-prone areas. Already, homeowners in high-risk or fire-damaged areas are seeing their rates double or triple. This is being framed as a â€œcrisisâ€ because high rates can slow growth in those areas, or price people out. More and more high-risk homeownersâ€™ insurance is being taken on by Californiaâ€™s FAIR Plan, an industry-funded, bare-bones insurance of last resort. The California Department of Insurance reports that FAIR policies rose by 177 percent between 2015 and 2018; more than half are now in fire-prone areas.
The unavoidable truth is that when people move to those areas, it creates risk. If insurance doesnâ€™t fully cover the risk, someone else will. And insurance rates are beginning to fall short. â€œHomeownersâ€™ coverage, an $8 billion-a-year business in California, has become an unmitigated disaster for carriers,â€ reports the Sacramento Bee. â€œFor every $1 they collected in premiums from Californians last year, they paid $1.70 in claims, according to data collected by the Department of Insurance.â€ That might just be a one-time spike in claims, but given everything we know about California forests, probably not.
So on one side, you have homeowners angry that insurance rates are rising, and on the other, you have the economics of homeownersâ€™ insurance turning sour for the industry. There is going to be intense pressure on California legislators to fill in this gap with some kind of public subsidy.
They should resist. Speaking to the Bee, state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said, â€œwe need to take proactive steps to protect our consumers.â€ He proposes, for instance, subsidies for low-income homeowners in these areas.
Thereâ€™s an equity argument for that, but state officials shouldnâ€™t do much more. If private insurance rates donâ€™t pay for these risks, taxpayers will. Itâ€™s unclear why a state facing intense wildfire risk should subsidize people living in fire-prone areas.
No one wants to say it out loud, but it may simply be that people shouldnâ€™t live in tier 3, high-risk fire zones in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), and the 15 percent of Californians that live in them now will eventually have to move, just as southern Floridians will eventually have to move out of flooded coastal areas. Denser, safer areas of the state will have to make room for them.
CPUC
Another route would be to simply prohibit development in some areas, but given the housing crisis, state lawmakers are leery of anything that might suppress new housing construction. Newsom says he doesnâ€™t want to limit where people can live because it violates Californiaâ€™s â€œpioneering spirit,â€ but really, no one wants to confront the united might of angry state developers and homeowners.
Finally, developers and homeowners must be pushed to use fire-resistant materials and to clear their properties of flammable materials. When they donâ€™t, they put entire communities at risk.
But this is also a political challenge. Last week, Newsom vetoed AB 1516, which would have required homeowners to clear a â€œdefensible spaceâ€ around their property, saying that it â€œtakes a broad swathâ€ approach that does not reflect the needs of individual communities. (He did not explain what part of neighborhood character is served by unsafe buildings.)
Meanwhile, building inspections are falling woefully short. Cal Fire has inspected only a tiny fraction of buildings â€” just 6 percent in some fire-prone areas of northern California.
How cooperative will California homeowners be in this undertaking? Well, letâ€™s check in on the Berkeley Hills, where city officials are trying to create a few small no-parking zones so that emergency vehicles can access the areaâ€™s narrow, winding streets. Berkeleyside reports:
Despite the program proceeding slowly on just three streets (Alvarado, Bridge, and Vicente roads) and assurances that the program would maintain â€œsome parking for the neighborhoods,â€ residents are already warning Wengraf that they plan to fight.
â€œOne woman on Tamalpais told me sheâ€™d lay down in the street and block our trucks,â€ said Wengraf. â€œSome people think they own the street in front of their houses.â€
Residents in the Oakland hills are protesting the same thing. Some homeowners, resident Daniel Matthews told the East Bay Times, â€œhave no parking, so if you say â€˜no one can park in the street,â€™ then I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing.â€
Meanwhile, over in Mill Valley, the city council passed an ordinance requiring around 75 percent of residents (the ones who live in the WUI) to remove plants and other flammable materials from the area immediately around their homes. Oops. After a homeowner revolt and a packed-to-spillover meeting in September, the Marin Independent Journal reports, â€œthe council voted unanimously to amend the municipal law so that the hardscape would be voluntary, rather than mandatory as originally proposed.â€
There is no end to local stories like this. All the while, new developments are being proposed and approved in high-risk areas, often with the complicity and encouragement of local officials.
Local officials simply donâ€™t want to limit local growth or inconvenience local residents. Itâ€™s a collective action problem, and the answer â€” on building codes, zoning codes, and other issues with direct impact on the stateâ€™s collective safety â€” is for state lawmakers to implement equitable state-wide solutions. Local control over land-use cannot be allowed to drag the state into perpetual crisis.
Californians, from entitled homeowners to cowardly public officials, bear plenty of responsibility for the wildfire crisis, which is not unrelated to the stateâ€™s housing crisis, for which they also bear plenty of responsibility. They canâ€™t just blame all of this on utilities.
Nonetheless, their biggest utility, PG&E, really does suck. So letâ€™s take a look at what to do about that.
The question of how to reform PG&E is vexed. Vexed, I tell you.
For the long-term health of the stateâ€™s electricity system, one of its most urgent, consequential, complicated, and difficult tasks is fixing PG&E. And despite what many people seem to think, there is no simple or easy answer for how to do that.
Right now, the utility is in bankruptcy court. Its fate lies in the hand of Judge Dennis Montali.
PG&E shareholders have submitted a plan for reorganization, but a few weeks ago, Montali ruled that shareholders would no longer have the exclusive right to form a plan. He opened up proceedings to a separate plan submitted by a set of bondholders allied with groups representing fire victims. The two factions are now vying in court.
It is difficult, from the outside, to assess which of the two plans is better. PG&E shareholders and their Wall Street backers want to raise money for both debts to pay off creditors and equity to invest in grid safety. They propose a cap of $18.9 billion on fire payouts, and since they agreed a few weeks ago to settle insurance claims for $11 billion, that would leave about $8 billion to compensate individual fire victims.
The plan alienated fire victims, who then allied with bondholders (who had already tried unsuccessfully to submit a plan of their own) to create a plan the judge accepted for consideration.
The bondholder plan would treat existing shareholders much more harshly, dilute the stock more, put more money toward debt, create a bigger fund to pay for fire claims, and leave bondholders and fire victims with the largest stake in the company. It would also fire PG&Eâ€™s entire board of directors, ensuring the replacements included â€œone seat to the companyâ€™s employees, one seat to a ratepayer advocacy group, and one seat to the state wildfire fund.â€
It might be easy to see the shareholders as the bad guys in this fight, since theyâ€™re mostly the ones who mismanaged PG&E for so long, but itâ€™s not that simple.

For one thing, it seems relevant that the bondholders in question are dominated by Elliott Management, which is run by Paul Singer, a longtime GOP mega-donor who recently warned that â€œsocialism is on the march again.â€ Singer is chair of the board of trustees for the libertarian Manhattan Institute, which frequently argues against renewable energy.
Elliott is widely known for its adversarial approach, buying up stock in companies, firing boards and CEOs, investing heavily in bankruptcy lawyers, and stripping companies back to core functions that provide reliable shareholder returns. It is the largest investor in serially bankrupt coal giant Peabody Energy. Itâ€™s a big investor in FirstEnergy, which is also in bankruptcy and has a long record of seeking and receiving bailouts. (The utility will profit from Ohioâ€™s terrible recent energy bill.)
Singer is known for pushing utilities to adopt a â€œback to basicsâ€ approach, which among other things tends to mean ditching renewable energy. In 2017, Elliott invested heavily in NRG Energy, which shortly thereafter announced a â€œtransformation planâ€ that would â€œraise $2.5 to $4 billion by divesting 50 to 100 percent of its NRG Yield renewable energy business and some of its conventional energy assets.â€ Last year, Elliott and Bluescape Resources called for an overhaul of Sempra Energy, in which they shared a 5 percent stake. Among their recommendations was that Sempra sell its renewables division. (The company ultimately didnâ€™t, though it did â€œstreamlineâ€ in a number of ways.)
The hedge fund business model is to focus on immediate returns to shareholders at the expense of diversification and long-term investing. That model might benefit PG&E investors more in the near term â€” it might even benefit existing wildfire victims more in the near term â€” but what the state needs now more than ever is some long-term thinking.
PG&E couldnâ€™t just ditch renewables in California as Singer has counseled utilities elsewhere. The CPUC and legislators will force it to obey existing clean-energy mandates. And the sheer size and significance of PG&E give it some stability. But having Singer involved in shaping the companyâ€™s future is, at the very least, of dubious value in a state committed to decarbonization.
So for now itâ€™s hedge fund versus hedge fund, with Californians pinning their hopes on a bankruptcy judge to ensure that they see some of the proceeds and that PG&E starts doing whatâ€™s right.

Another wrinkle: Through a quirk of bankruptcy law, any new wildfire-damage claimants that come along during bankruptcy are automatically put in line for payment ahead of â€œpre-bankruptcy creditors,â€ including pre-bankruptcy fire victims. Yet those pre-bankruptcy creditors must be paid in full before PG&E can exit bankruptcy. So additional wildfires this season or next could delay PG&Eâ€™s exit and drive up its liabilities, possibly to the point that it will be difficult to attract private investment at all. Itâ€™s a ticking time bomb.
Very few bankruptcy proceedings deal with an entity this large and this connected to the public welfare, with such giant, unpredictable, ongoing liabilities. Itâ€™s a bit of a nightmare.
Some on the left advocate for making PG&E a public utility, having California buy it outright and possibly break it up into smaller municipal utilities. But these arguments rarely grapple with the trade-offs; they proceed directly from â€œPG&E is guilty of criminal mismanagement,â€ which is indisputably true, to â€œPG&E should be public,â€ skipping several important steps in between. (Note: The restructuring plan put forward by bondholders and wildfire victims explicitly disavows municipalization, mainly because the utility union opposes it.)
For one thing, PG&E being so big has the effect of socializing costs among its 5.4 million electricity accounts. As places like San Francisco municipalize, the wealthiest ratepayers with the cheapest electricity will peel off, leaving (often poorer) residents of more sparsely populated areas facing ever-rising costs, further accelerated by wildfires. Whatever you think of rural residents paying more for electricity, it raises serious equity issues and promises political blowback.
Regardless, municipalization could take years, a decade or more, as it did in Sacramento, especially if PG&E fights it, as it likely will. San Francisco is attempting it now and San Jose is considering it, but itâ€™s still too early to know if the process has gotten any easier. It is unlikely to prove a short-term solution in either case.
For another thing, PG&E doesnâ€™t just come with assets. It comes with $30 billion in debt and virtually unlimited liabilities.
The problem isnâ€™t just existing debt. If California took over PG&E, all those decisions about whether or not to shut down the electricity grid to avoid wildfires would be made by public officials. All responsibility for raising electricity rates to invest in grid hardening (while regularly cutting off electricity) would fall to public officials. All the liability for wildfire damages caused by power lines would be born by Californian taxpayers. The state would effectively be inheriting a shitshow of private capitalâ€™s making, allowing private capital to escape paying for it.
Given how little the state has been able to do to solve the housing crisis, it is at the very least not obvious that it would do a better job handling this adjacent crisis. (All that said, at least one state senator is looking into legislation that would make PG&E public.)
PG&Eâ€™s profits need to be tied to doing a good job
Ultimately, the question of public versus private is somewhat orthogonal to the quality of utility service â€” there are dirtier and cleaner municipal utilities, dirtier and cleaner IOUs, good and bad actors in both categories. A better lens through which to view the debate is one that is virtually absent from the conversation around PG&E: the incentive structure in which utilities operate.
As a fully regulated, investor-owned utility, PG&E does not make profits for its investors through the sale of electricity. It only recoups costs on power sales. (It is a monopoly, and no monopoly can be allowed to set the price of its own product.)
Rather, investors make money through a guaranteed rate of return on investments approved by the CPUC, generally investments in building and maintaining grid infrastructure. Naturally, this gives PG&E great incentive to pitch the CPUC on new investments. Getting new ones approved â€” â€œrate basingâ€ them (i.e., raising customer rates to pay for them) â€” is how the company best serves shareholders.
Actually making those investments, ensuring quality service, is largely left in the utilityâ€™s hands. That creates an incentive to keep returns high for shareholders by skimping on implementation, which PG&E did repeatedly.
It also creates an incentive to avoid anything that might lead customers to need less utility infrastructure, like energy efficiency, batteries, or microgrids. All those things are against shareholdersâ€™ interests. Thatâ€™s why IOUs tend to invest only as much in them as required by law, and no more. They want to build more stuff, not less stuff.
Utilities love building this stuff. Shutterstock
The problem here is not so much the profit motive as what makes profits. The incentive structure is completely wrong.
That can be fixed. Regulated monopoly utilities are not operating in free markets; they are operating in environments built entirely by law and regulation. The fact that they make profits solely through big capital investments is an artifact of that regulatory environment. The environment could be designed to produce other results.
This is not the place to get into utility regulatory design (I recommend the Regulatory Assistance Project for a deeper dive), but the key concept to understand is â€œperformance-based regulation.â€ The goal is to reduce the amount of IOU shareholder compensation that comes from fixed returns on investments and increase the amount that comes from variable returns on performance-based metrics.
In plain English, that means reforming regulations so that utilities make more money if they achieve particular outcomes. Those outcomes can be determined by legislators and PUCs, ranging from service uptime (minimizing blackouts) to customer satisfaction, renewable-energy penetration, electrification, efficiency, or resiliency.
Other, incremental efforts to adjust PG&Eâ€™s incentives are forlorn. Earlier this year, California state Sen. Scott Wiener introduced a bill that would fine PG&E for planned blackouts. His reasoning was that the utility now has enormous financial incentive to avoid wildfires but very little incentive to avoid blackouts. And that is true, as far as it goes, but it is an incredibly crude instrument for balancing PG&Eâ€™s incentives. It would make more sense to simply tie PG&Eâ€™s profits to reliable power delivery.
Another necessary regulatory reform is to break up governance of the electricity transmission and distribution systems. Local electricity distribution systems need to get smarter, able to generate, store, and manage more of their own power, and they need to be run by local entities.
In other words, California needs a more distributed energy system. That is the only true long-term solution to the wildfire mess. Itâ€™s going to happen one way or another, so the state ought to do it deliberately and equitably, with some foresight (as much as that might break precedent).
The question of how to properly distribute power â€” the electrical kind and the political kind â€” is a complicated subject in its own right. I will dive into that in my next post."
"Hillary Clinton emerged from relative political obscurity last week to claim that Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic presidential candidate and member of Congress from Hawaii, was â€œthe favorite of the Russiansâ€ prepping for a third-party spoiler run during a podcast interview. She went so far as to imply that the representative was â€œa Russian asset.â€
Gabbard fired back by calling Clinton â€œthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.â€ In Gabbardâ€™s telling, her partyâ€™s 2016 nominee was behind â€œa concerted campaign to destroy my reputation ... through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine.â€
â€œItâ€™s now clear that this primary is between you and me,â€ Gabbard, who is at 1.2 percent in the RealClearPolitics primary polling average, concluded. â€œDonâ€™t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.â€
This is a bizarrely intense fight given that these two are members of the same party. Clinton suggesting Gabbard is the Kremlinâ€™s chosen agent for destroying the Democrats in 2020? Gabbard accusing Clinton of being the puppet master behind a massive conspiracy against her? Are these people serious?
Unfortunately, the answer to that question is â€œyesâ€ â€” in ways that reveal some troubling tendencies among American liberals and leftists today.
On Clintonâ€™s part, the accusation reflects a remarkable overestimation of Russian influence on the part of certain Democratic Party loyalists â€” and a corresponding willingness to fling around baseless allegations of people they donâ€™t like being aligned with the Kremlin agents. At bottom, itâ€™s a conspiratorial way of viewing the world that disconnects Democrats from reality.
Gabbardâ€™s bizarre counter-allegations of a Clinton conspiracy reflect the way in which her nominally anti-war politics are actually a kind of pro-authoritarian, conspiratorial worldview â€” particularly on Syria, an issue at the top of the political agenda right now. Her approach has a handful of fans on the partyâ€™s left flank but has really found its base on the pro-Trump right, real-life proof the horseshoe theory of the political spectrum has actual merit.
Fortunately, these tendencies do not seem to be afflicting any of the top contenders for the partyâ€™s nomination at the moment. Politicians closer to the center like former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg donâ€™t sound like Clinton; left-wing candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders donâ€™t sound like Gabbard. But this ugly fight exposes real internal problems on the (broadly construed) left half of the American political spectrum, ones that liberals and leftists cannot and should not ignore.
What Hillary Clinton gets wrong about Tulsi Gabbard and why it matters

To be fair to Clinton, one can see why she would think itâ€™s plausible that Gabbard is Russiaâ€™s favorite candidate in the 2020 primary.
Gabbard is a combat veteran and US Army reservist who has made issues of war and peace the central plank of her campaign platform. She has sold herself as a non-interventionist, a critic of â€œregime changeâ€ and â€œendless war.â€ In practice, though, Gabbardâ€™s record doesnâ€™t fully bear this stance out. She has long spoken favorably about American use of force when itâ€™s not directed at toppling dictators, arguing that the US needs to refocus on fighting Islamist terrorists.
As far back as 2015, she has been advocating that the US work with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad â€” and his chief ally, Russia â€” in fighting ISIS and extremist factions among the Syrian rebels. This view has led her to take a remarkably pro-Russia stance on the Syria conflict, even when it clashes with the policies of her own partyâ€™s president and standard-bearer.
In January 2017, she traveled to Syria and met with Assad personally, catching the Democratic leadership in Congress off-guard. After returning to the US, she went on CNN and parroted the regimeâ€™s line that there was â€œno differenceâ€ between the mainstream anti-Assad rebels and ISIS. At last weekâ€™s Democratic debate, she described the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria, which is controlled by Americaâ€™s Kurdish allies, as â€œyet another negative consequence of the regime change war weâ€™ve been waging in Syriaâ€ â€” a false description of what happened that seemed to let Trumpâ€™s troop withdrawal off the hook.
The Kremlin may be taking notice. One recent analysis from the Alliance for Securing Democracy (an electoral interference monitoring group) found that Russian state media has given Gabbard disproportionate coverage relative to her poll numbers. It also documented Twitter bots that appear to be of Russian origin being active on her behalf. That said, the extent to which Russian bots are working to promote Gabbard is contested, and itâ€™s not clear that Clinton is justified in saying that Gabbard is Russiaâ€™s favorite.
But Clintonâ€™s comment seems to go further than that. Take a look at the full context from an episode of Campaign HQ, former Obama aide David Plouffeâ€™s podcast. It seems to suggest that Gabbard is not only Russiaâ€™s favorite but actually its agent in the Democratic Party:
PLOUFFE: [Trump is] going to try to drive people not to vote for him, but to say you canâ€™t vote for them either...
CLINTON: Theyâ€™re also going to do third party again. And Iâ€™m not making any predictions, but I think theyâ€™ve got their eye on somebody [Gabbard] who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. Sheâ€™s the favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far. And thatâ€™s assuming [Green Party 2016 candidate] Jill Stein will give it up, which she might not, because sheâ€™s also a Russian asset.
Now Clinton is not saying that Russia is â€œgroomingâ€ Gabbard as an agent â€” which many media outlets initially reported. Rather, sheâ€™s saying that Trump and the GOP are grooming Gabbard to be a third-party candidate, while sheâ€™s simultaneously getting outside support from the Russians.
But the use of the word â€œalsoâ€ in that last line about Jill Stein seems to heavily imply that Gabbard is a Russian agent. While itâ€™s not clear if thatâ€™s what Clinton meant to say, her phrasing was at best sloppy and at worst making an inflammatory accusation against Gabbard (and Stein) without real evidence.
Itâ€™s hard to overstate how serious it is to accuse a politician you donâ€™t like of being an actual agent of a hostile power, of working to undermine the United States from within. The fact that Russian mouthpieces seem to approve of Gabbard and Stein is hardly sufficient to level such a grave charge.
Yet Clintonâ€™s comments are not a one-off: they reflect a tendency among Democratic loyalists, both in the elite and rank and file, to throw around charges of Russian influence without much grounding in fact.
The most extreme manifestations of this are Twitter personalities like Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor, self-appointed Russia experts who built up a following among hardcore #resistance types by constantly predicting the reveal of proof that Trump is in Putinâ€™s thrall â€” evidence that never seems to materialize. This strain of pure fantasy never became influential in the party, but there is a more attenuated version that did: Democratic politicians and liberal media outlets have frequently overhyped Trump-Russia connections or Russian penetration of the American political system, assigning it a degree of influence over American politicians and the votersâ€™ minds that has not been supported by evidence.
Clintonâ€™s comments are emblematic of this more subtle version of Russian overhype. Itâ€™s a worldview that conveniently exonerates Clinton for her 2016 defeat, suggesting that the Russians rather than Clintonâ€™s own missteps decided the election. Itâ€™s a kind of epistemic poison, leading Democrats astray in a similar-but-much-smaller-scale way that Fox News narratives mislead Republicans. When you develop a vision of American electoral politics that overstates Russian power, you end up missing what actually matters.
Somewhat ironically, itâ€™s also one that helps the Russians. The Kremlinâ€™s email hacking and bot-tweeting campaigns were first and foremost designed to stoke divisions and inflame partisanship in the United States, turning up the heat on American partisan disputes and limiting the US governmentâ€™s ability to coherently counter Russiaâ€™s aggressive foreign policy. Calling your political enemies Russian agents certainly helps this goal along.
â€œPutin can rejoice in the actions of the latter-day witch-hunters who are forever spying Russian influence,â€ Mark Galeotti, a Russia expert at the Royal United Services Institute, writes in the Moscow Times. â€œBy turning political debate into a hunt for traitors, it generates the very kind of toxic, suspicious political culture that undermines the bonds of solidarity and civility that underpin democratic societies.â€
There are good reasons to be skeptical of Gabbardâ€™s stances on foreign policy. But Clintonâ€™s insinuations of dark connections between her and the Kremlin absent solid evidence help no one.
What Tulsi Gabbard gets wrong about Hillary Clinton and why it matters
Gabbardâ€™s response to Clinton was, if anything, even worse than the original comments.
While Clinton never outright says that Gabbard is a Russian plant, merely heavily implying it, Gabbard accuses Clinton of masterminding a gigantic conspiracy against her without the slightest shred of evidence. She did so first in a series of tweets on Friday:
She continued to hammer home this theme in the days after. In an official video released on Sunday, she accuses an unspecified â€œtheyâ€ (presumably Democratic elites) of organizing to â€œdestroyâ€ and â€œdiscreditâ€ anyone who dissents from their official line. On Monday, she tweeted out a video of a friendly interview she did with Fox News host Tucker Carlson in which she accuses â€œHillary Clinton, her proxies, [and] the warmongering establishmentâ€ of â€œconducting this coordinated smear campaign.â€
The idea that Clinton is masterminding some kind of coordinated smear campaign in the media, that all of Gabbardâ€™s critics are Clinton â€œproxies,â€ is the textbook definition of a conspiracy theory. But itâ€™s hardly the first time Gabbard has embraced outlandish ideas that happen to flatter her worldview.
When Bashar al-Assadâ€™s forces used chemical weapons against Syrian civilians in April 2017, Gabbard said she was â€œskepticalâ€ that Assad was responsible, aligning herself with conspiracy theorists against both US intelligence and the overwhelming majority of independent experts.
Gabbardâ€™s penchant for strangely reasoned defenses of militant foreign strongmen â€” sheâ€™s an avowed fan of Indiaâ€™s anti-Muslim, illiberal Prime Minister Narendra Modi â€” has contributed to her marginalization not only from both the Clintonite Democratic center but the also the Warren-Sanders left. Only a few on the so-called â€œanti-imperialistâ€ left support her, a group made up of relatively obscure Twitter pundits with about as much influence on the actually existing Democratic Party as Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor. Her lack of a meaningful factional support base is a big reason why her poll numbers have been low for the entire primary.
But her appearance on Carlsonâ€™s show reveals how sheâ€™s succeeded in building a different fanbase: pro-Trump conservatives.

Gabbard has progressive views on domestic policy, despite some past stances to the contrary. But centering her political appeal on her foreign policy, where sheâ€™s honestly not very far from Donald Trump, has made her some fans in MAGA-world. Ben Domenech, the publisher of the devotedly pro-Trump website The Federalist, donated $250 to Gabbardâ€™s campaign. Steve Bannon has expressed admiration for her; so too have leading figures in the alt-right.
What this points to is a certain commonality, at the very extreme ends of the spectrum, between left-wing critique of â€œAmerican empireâ€ and right-wing isolationism â€” a foreign policy variant of the â€œhorseshoe theoryâ€ of political ideology, which posits some factions on the extremes are closer to each other than those on the center-left and center-right.
The left-wing variant starts from the idea that America has evil intentions for the rest of the world â€” that it is, in fact, the largest threat to global stability on the planet. The right-wing version argues that the United States has no obligation to the rest of the world; that the US needs to put â€œAmerica First,â€ even when it means ignoring suffering abroad.
These doctrines converge on the idea that the United States needs to stay out of foreign conflicts and even sometimes cross the line into outright apologia for bad actors abroad. This is how Assad and his Russian backers get painted as potential allies against jihadism rather than the human rights abusers they are, both by Gabbard and by Trumpists.
I donâ€™t mean to draw equivalences here. While Gabbard only has a handful of fans on the left, Donald Trump is the president of the United States. But Gabbardâ€™s embrace of anti-Clinton conspiracies and foreign autocrats shows how a strain of left-wing analysis, applied sophomorically, can lead to pretty ugly places. Sheâ€™s a useful cautionary tale at a time when the leftâ€™s stock is rising on the Democratic side of the aisle."
"Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein have a few things in common.
They both ascended to positions of power â€” Trump, obviously, is still there. They both have been accused of harassment and sexual assault by multiple women. And both reportedly had close relationships with the leadership of the National Enquirer.
By the 2010s, the Enquirer had a reputation as a racy supermarket tabloid, known for breaking stories about Bristol Palinâ€™s pregnancy and John Edwardsâ€™s affair with Rielle Hunter. But more important than the stories it ran may have been the ones it didnâ€™t: stories about allegations against Trump and Weinstein that, according to New Yorker reporter Ronan Farrow, its editors and executives worked to suppress.
That process, known as â€œcatch and kill,â€ is the subject and title of Farrowâ€™s recent book. And on Tuesday, Barry Levine, a former executive editor at the Enquirer, published his own book with journalist Monique El-Faizy, detailing 43 new allegations of â€œinappropriate behaviorâ€ by Trump over the course of his life. (Trump has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct.) Itâ€™s not clear which, if any, of these allegations were known to the Enquirer before the 2016 election, and Levine told Vox that all the reporting in the book is new. But some of the allegations date back decades and are a reminder of the many, many stories that women had about Trump â€” if media outlets were interested in publishing them.
Itâ€™s now been three years since Trump was heard on tape bragging about grabbing women â€œby the pussy,â€ and two years since the Weinstein allegations first broke in the New York Times. The work of investigative journalists has revealed much about sexual misconduct by powerful men and its impact on the people, many of them women, who experience it. Itâ€™s also revealed the networks of complicity and influence that protected those men for years, and in some cases may be protecting them still.
The National Enquirer was the nexus of one such network, according to Farrow and others.
The Enquirerâ€™s longtime parent company, AMI, denies the allegations in Farrowâ€™s book. â€œMr. Farrowâ€™s narrative is driven by unsubstantiated allegations from questionable sources and while these stories may be dramatic, they are completely untrue,â€ a company spokesperson told Vox.

But even whatâ€™s publicly known about AMI and Trump shows the company helped shape the narrative of his public and private life during the 2016 campaign in ways unquestionably favorable to him. And Farrowâ€™s reporting on Weinstein only adds to a long list of people and institutions accused of enabling the producer over the years, while, according to dozens of women, he was committing harassment and sexual assault. (Weinstein has denied all allegations of â€œnonconsensual sexual activityâ€ and has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault charges.)
The history of the Enquirer and its ties to Trump, Weinstein, and others is a reminder that abuse of power doesnâ€™t happen in a vacuum. Just as important as the misdeeds of powerful men are the people willing to cover up those misdeeds and what they hope to get in return.
AMI paid to keep Karen McDougal quiet about Trump. It was also involved in the Stormy Daniels payout, Farrow reports.
Founded in 1926 as the New York Enquirer, the National Enquirer gained a reputation in the 1950s for salacious stories with lines like, â€œIâ€™m sorry I killed my mother, but Iâ€™m glad I killed my father,â€ according to the International Directory of Company Histories. In the 1980s, the paperâ€™s parent company acquired other publications including the Weekly World News (which became famous for questionable stories like that of a â€œbat childâ€ allegedly found in a cave), and in 1995 it changed its name from Enquirer/Star Group to American Media Inc. (AMI). The company, which sold off the National Enquirer in April, still uses the name AMI today.
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the Enquirer ran racy stories about celebrities and politicians, often about extramarital affairs or drug use. While many headlines seemed salacious and unfounded, others about John Edwardsâ€™s â€œsecret love childâ€ and Rush Limbaughâ€™s problem with painkillers proved true.

In 1999, David Pecker bought AMI and became its CEO. Over the years, Pecker developed a friendship with Donald Trump. When Trump decided to run for president, the paper officially endorsed him and ran glowing coverage of his campaign. After the 2016 election, Pecker told a reporter that criticizing Trump was the same as criticizing AMI, because â€œthe guyâ€™s a personal friend of mine,â€ Farrow writes.
And according to Farrow, AMI had a hand in at least three stories that could have negatively affected his run.
The first was in 2015, when Dino Sajudin, a former doorman at Trump Tower, told AMI that Trump had fathered a child with Trumpâ€™s former housekeeper, according to Farrow. Reporters pursued the story, Farrow writes, and the Enquirer even hired private investigators. But then, according to Catch and Kill, Pecker put a stop to the investigation. Instead, AMI agreed to pay Sajudin $30,000 for the rights to his story, with a $1 million penalty if Sajudin ever told it without the companyâ€™s permission, Farrow reports.
The substance of the story has never been confirmed, and Sajudinâ€™s ex-wife said he had a habit of telling tall tales â€” â€œheâ€™s seen Bigfoot,â€ she said, according to Farrow. But Trumpâ€™s then-lawyer Michael Cohen monitored the process of buying and hushing up the story, according to Farrow. â€œThereâ€™s no question it was done as a favor to continue to protect Trump,â€ a former AMI employee told the reporter.
The next high-profile story to come to AMI was that of Karen McDougal. The fitness expert and former Playboy model says she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007, while he was married to his current wife, Melania Trump. With his presidential campaign in full swing in 2016, McDougal decided to tell her story before someone else did, according to Farrow.
Through a lawyer, she got in touch with AMI. According to Farrow, Pecker quickly alerted Cohen to the story, and Trump asked Pecker for help. So AMI agreed in August 2016 to pay her $150,000 for the rights to the story, Farrow reports, which it never published (the men who helped broker the deal got 45 percent of the payment, leaving McDougal with $82,500). McDougal told Farrow she was unsure what she was allowed to say publicly under the agreement.
â€œIt took my rights away,â€ McDougal said of the agreement. â€œIâ€™m afraid to even mention his name.â€
AMI told Farrow that thanks to an amendment to her contract, McDougal was actually allowed to â€œrespond to legitimate press inquiriesâ€ about her relationship with Trump. The company maintained that its payment to McDougal hadnâ€™t been an example of â€œcatch and killâ€ and that it didnâ€™t run her story because it did not find it credible.
Later in 2016, Farrow writes, Stormy Daniels approached AMI, through her lawyer, Keith Davidson, who had already represented McDougal in her deal with the company. Daniels, a porn actress and director, says she had sex with Trump in 2006, when he was married to Melania. When Davidson approached AMI with her story, the company passed, according to Farrow: â€œPecker had just extended himself for Trump and was growing antsy about the potential for fallout.â€
However, Farrow writes, National Enquirer editor-in-chief Dylan Howard directed Daniels to Cohen, Trumpâ€™s lawyer, who paid Daniels $130,000 in hush money through a shell company â€” and ultimately went to prison for it.
The Enquirer may have been privy to other information about Trump
There have also been hints, both in Farrowâ€™s book and elsewhere, of more material on Trump that the Enquirer might have had and chosen not to publish. One former National Enquirer editor told Farrow that the paper had killed around 10 fully reported stories about Trump over the years and turned down potential leads on many more.
In 2018, Page Six reported that Barry Levine, former executive editor of the Enquirer, was writing a book about Trump. Levine had left the Enquirer in March 2016 after 17 years with the paper, and when his upcoming book was announced, many speculated that it could contain new revelations about the relationship between Pecker, the Enquirer, and the man who became president. â€œThe National Enquirerâ€™s long-held secrets about Donald Trump may be about to get substantially less secret,â€ Oli Coleman wrote at Page Six.
Levineâ€™s book, All the Presidentâ€™s Women: Donald Trump and the Making of a Predator, written with journalist and author Monique El-Faizy, was released this week. Contrary to the speculation, it doesnâ€™t seem to reveal anything about the Enquirer or AMI; David Pecker isnâ€™t mentioned. In writing about the deal with McDougal, Levine and El-Faizy donâ€™t even bring up AMI, writing only that â€œa party working on Trumpâ€™s behalf paid McDougal $150,000 to buy her silence.â€
Asked about the decision not to discuss Pecker or AMI in the book, Levine told Vox in an email, â€œItâ€™s my practice not to comment on any past jobs Iâ€™ve had over my 40-year career in print and TV.â€ By the same token, he did not comment on whether he had been aware of any efforts to kill Trump-related stories during his time at the Enquirer. In 2018, though, the Wall Street Journal reported that according to former Enquirer employees, tips about Trump â€œpoured intoâ€ the publication after Trump started on Celebrity Apprentice in 2002, and Levine reminded staffers that â€œMr. Pecker wouldnâ€™t allowâ€ stories that painted Trump in a bad light.

Levine told Vox that all the reporting in All the Presidentâ€™s Women took place after he left the Enquirer â€” â€œI began this book project in the spring of 2018, and embarked on all original and new reporting,â€ he said, â€œand Iâ€™m very proud of what my little reporting team accomplished!â€ (In an authorâ€™s note at the beginning of the book, Levine cites the contributions of El-Faizy as well as two other reporters, Whitney Clegg and Lucy Osborne.)
Still, many of the allegations in All the Presidentâ€™s Women date back years. Karen Johnson, for example, says that at a party at Mar-a-Lago in the 2000s, Trump grabbed her, pulled her behind a tapestry, and kissed her without her consent.
Barbara Pilling, a model, says when she met Trump at a party in 1989, he asked her age. When she replied that she was 17, he said, â€œThatâ€™s just great; youâ€™re not too old, not too young.â€ He told her she was gorgeous and offered to take her to dinner, she recalled. And when a waitress walked by, Pilling said, â€œTrump slapped her on the behind.â€
David Webber, a fashion photographer, told Levine and El-Faizy that at a nightclub party in the 1990s, he noticed that Trump had a girl, likely no older than 16, cornered â€” â€œhe had surrounded her with his bigness, if you like. He had one hand on the wall to one side and she was against the wall.â€
â€œOur faces met across the room and she mouthed â€˜Helpâ€™ at me,â€ Webber recalled to the authors. When he intervened and pulled her away, she thanked him profusely, he said. Of Trump, Webber said, â€œHe was a predator. Absolutely.â€ (Trump declined to comment for Levine and El-Faizyâ€™s book.)
Of course, these stories only add to the multitude of allegations against Trump that are already public; at least 22 women have accused him of sexual misconduct. Thereâ€™s no way to know how many, if any, of the allegations against Trump were known to AMI staff before the election.
But Levine and El-Faizy paint a picture of a man who, by the time he sought the nomination, had been known for decades in his circles for predatory behavior and unwanted advances. If he had been someone else, the Enquirer might well have dug into the many stories about him, especially when he turned from reality TV host to presidential candidate. Instead, as Farrow notes, when the paper ran a feature on â€œTwisted Secrets of the Candidates,â€ Trumpâ€™s â€œsecretâ€ was: â€œHe has greater support and popularity than even heâ€™s admitted to!â€
AMI is also accused of blackmailing Trump enemy Jeff Bezos
Peckerâ€™s relationship with Trump continued after the latter took office, according to Farrow. AMI employees told the reporter that Trump associates had introduced Pecker to potential funding sources for the company. In 2017, Pecker had dinner at the White House with â€œa French businessman known for brokering deals with Saudi Arabia,â€ Farrow writes. Two months later, the businessman and Pecker met with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS.
In 2018, AMI published a nearly 100-page, ad-free magazine full of articles, many of them unbylined, praising MBS, as Spencer Ackerman reported at the Daily Beast. The magazine called MBS â€œour closest Middle East ally destroying terrorismâ€ and included coverage of â€œNew Rights for Saudi Women.â€ AMI said it had no outside help publishing the magazine and compared it to special issues on â€œThe Royals, Elvis, The Kennedys, The Olympics, etc.â€ (all subjects better known to Americans than MBS, Ackerman notes).
The magazine also included five photographs of Trump, including one of him shaking Salmanâ€™s hand. Next to that photograph is one of Salman shaking hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Around 2018, Farrow reports, Enquirer editor Dylan Howard began pursuing a story on allegations of infidelity by Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Trump has long made plain his hatred for Bezos, who he calls â€œJeff Bozo,â€ who also owns the Washington Post, part of the â€œFake News Mediaâ€ Trump so disdains.

In late 2018, the Washington Post was investigating the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In November, the paper was the first to report that according to the CIA, his death had been ordered by Salman.
In February 2019, Bezos wrote in a blog post on Medium that AMI leadership had approached him to say that it had texts and photographs (including what Howard, in an email, called a â€œd*ck pickâ€) proving that Bezos was having an affair. AMI, he said, offered not to publish them if the Post would stop its investigations into Saudi Arabia.
Instead, Bezos chose to publish the email heâ€™d received from AMI. â€œThese communications cement AMIâ€™s long-earned reputation for weaponizing journalistic privileges, hiding behind important protections, and ignoring the tenets and purpose of true journalism,â€ Bezos wrote. â€œOf course I donâ€™t want personal photos published, but I also wonâ€™t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption.â€
In a statement at the time, AMI said that it would investigate Bezosâ€™s claims, but that it had been engaged in â€œgood faith negotiations to resolve all mattersâ€ with Bezos.
According to Farrow, however, AMIâ€™s reputation for blackmail was well-earned, with multiple employees saying the company engaged in the practice of â€œwithholding the publication of damaging information in exchange for tips or exclusives.â€
Employees also spoke of the companyâ€™s â€œsteadily accumulating blackmail power over Trump,â€ Farrow writes.
â€œIn theory, you would think that Trump has all the power in that relationship,â€ Maxine Page, an AMI employee on and off from 2002 to 2012, told Farrow, â€œbut in fact Pecker has the power â€” he has the power to run these stories. He knows where the bodies are buried.â€
Another powerful AMI friend was Harvey Weinstein
But Trump wasnâ€™t the only powerful man with a close relationship with AMI, Farrow writes. In 2015, AMI struck a production deal with Harvey Weinstein, and Howard and the producer became friends. According to Farrow, AMI then repeatedly sought to keep sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein from coming to light.
Howard explored a â€œcatch and killâ€ agreement to keep Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, who reported to police that Weinstein had groped her, from telling her story publicly, Farrow writes. According to the reporter, AMI staffers were also asked to pursue damaging stories on actress Ashley Judd. And after Rose McGowan tweeted that she had been raped by a â€œstudio headâ€ â€” referring, many guessed, to Weinstein â€” Howard said, â€œI want dirt on that bitch,â€ a former colleague told Farrow.
In late 2016, an AMI subcontractor made a secret recording of a woman saying damaging things about McGowan, according to Farrow. â€œI have something AMAZING,â€ Howard wrote to Weinstein, Farrow reports.
â€œThis is the killer,â€ Weinstein replied. â€œEspecially if my fingerprints r not on this.â€
According to Farrow, Weinstein may have tried to keep the allegations against him hidden by using AMIâ€™s reporting on another powerful man secretly facing sexual misconduct allegations: Matt Lauer. In 2016, when Farrow began reporting on the allegations against Weinstein, he was working at NBC, where Lauer was the co-host of Today and a major face of the network.
The Enquirer had been following allegations against Lauer for years, Farrow writes. As Farrow conducted his reporting on Weinstein, the Enquirer began contacting NBC employees about Lauer and running stories alleging that he was cheating on his wife, according to Catch and Kill. And sources at both AMI and NBC told Farrow theyâ€™d heard that Weinstein himself had made clear to NBC â€œthat he was aware of Lauerâ€™s behavior and capable of revealing it.â€ In other words, if NBC published allegations against Weinstein, then Weinstein would make public what he knew about Lauer.
NBC has denied that it was ever threatened with exposure of Lauer, and NBC executives say they didnâ€™t know about the allegations against Lauer until November 2017. Weinstein has also denied threatening NBC. But Farrow writes that â€œthere was no doubt that the allegations against Lauer, and NBCâ€™s wider use of nondisclosure agreements with women who experienced harassment, were under threat of exposure during our reporting. That precarious culture of secrecy made NBC more vulnerable to Harvey Weinsteinâ€™s intimidation and enticement.â€
Ultimately, NBC told Farrow he could no longer work on the Weinstein story at the network â€” â€œI canâ€™t have you going to any more sources,â€ NBC President Noah Oppenheim told Farrow, according to Catch and Kill.
Instead, Farrow ultimately published his reporting on Weinstein in the New Yorker, just a few days after Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey published their groundbreaking exposÃ© on allegations against the producer in the New York Times. Together, the two pieces helped open the floodgates, with more and more women coming forward about their experiences with Weinstein and other powerful men. The stories helped catapult the Me Too movement into its current, most public phase.
Some â€” but not all â€” of the National Enquirerâ€™s powerful friends have faced consequences
After the allegations against him were made public, Weinstein was fired from his production company and, eventually, indicted. He is scheduled to face trial in New York in January on sexual assault charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
The allegations about Lauer that had so frightened NBC, according to Farrow, were soon revealed, with journalists at the New York Times and Variety reporting on sexual assault and other misconduct allegations against the anchor. Lauer was fired in November 2017. (In response to allegations made in Farrowâ€™s book, Lauer said earlier this month that women had made up false claims about him to cover their own infidelity.)
The National Enquirer and AMI have faced their own legal troubles. AMIâ€™s payment to Karen McDougal was determined to be an illegal campaign contribution in 2018. The company struck a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors to avoid penalties as long as it refrained from committing crimes for a year â€” but its alleged threats to Bezos may have violated that agreement, and the company could find itself facing multiple charges.
The Enquirer has also gone through a change of ownership. In April, the Washington Post reported that AMI was selling the title to James Cohen, owner of the Hudson Group. However, as Vanity Fairâ€™s Joe Pompeo reported at the time, AMI will continue to provide â€œpublishing, financial, and distribution servicesâ€ to Hudson Group as part of the sale.
â€œThat arrangement, combined with Cohenâ€™s past business dealings and friendship with Pecker, and the fact that Enquirer employees are reportedly not moving from AMIâ€™s Lower Manhattan headquarters, will undoubtedly lead to curiosity about whether Pecker might retain at least a dash of influenceâ€ over the Enquirer, Pompeo wrote. (â€œThe titles included in the sale will no longer be a part of American Media and will report to the new owner,â€ an AMI spokesperson told Vanity Fair.)
Meanwhile, one powerful man has faced no consequences for the cover-ups that Farrow alleges were executed in his name. Though President Trump is currently facing an impeachment inquiry, itâ€™s not about payment to Karen McDougal through AMI or the payment to Stormy Daniels by Michael Cohen allegedly aided by AMI.

In the age of targeted Facebook ads, it can seem almost quaint to care about the influence of a print magazine â€” especially one like the National Enquirer that harkens back to a bygone era when people got their gossip from the checkout lines in supermarkets. But what the story of AMI shows, according to reporting by Farrow and others, is how eager a group of well-networked men were to protect one another from the stories of women to advance their common interest: power.
The 2010s have been an age of conspiracy theories, many of them false and damaging. But one conspiracy turns out to be real: A lot of the richest, most influential men in the world are friends with each other, and more and more evidence suggests that some of them have helped one another cover up terrible abuse committed against those less powerful than they are. The story of the National Enquirer and AMI appears to be an example of one such cover-up. If, in fact, it is over, another secret network has probably already sprung up to take its place."
"It should have been the decisive moment for Brexit: a vote on the revamped deal to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union by October 31.
But â€œSuper Saturdayâ€ went bust in the UK Parliament after lawmakers voted to withhold support on Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal until all the necessary legislation is passed, forcing the prime minister to seek an extension to prevent against an â€œaccidentalâ€ crash-out on October 31.
Johnson is required by UK law to send the EU a letter requesting a three-month delay to January 2020. But, as with all things Brexit, not even the simple stuff is simple. As Brexiter-in-chief, he did not do so willingly. He left the extension letter unsigned and included a signed second letter that made it clear Johnson thinks postponing Brexit would be bad.
The EU is considering the delay request even as Johnson is racing to finalize all the Brexit legislation to achieve a Halloween Brexit.
As all this was going on, hundreds of thousands marched in London to demand a second national referendum â€” another vote put to the people â€” on Brexit.
Right now, support for his Brexit deal remains tight â€” â€œa coin toss,â€ as Alexandra Cirone, a politics professor at Cornell University, described it last week. Thatâ€™s still the case this week, even as members of Parliament asked for a little extra time to deliberate the deal and legislation.
Johnsonâ€™s government published the withdrawal bill legislation late Monday, though some in Parliament are already trying, once again, to make things very difficult.
So expect another wild week in British politics as itâ€™s still undecided whether the UK will exit the EU in 10 days time. But hereâ€™s a brief recap of what went down while you were probably not watching Parliament on Saturday and whatâ€™s happened since in order to help you understand what might happen next.
Parliament foils Boris Johnsonâ€™s vote on his Brexit deal
The fate of Brexit could have been decided in a historic Saturday session in Parliament. But members of Parliament (MPs) had a different idea.
On Thursday, Johnson secured a revised Brexit agreement that scrapped the Irish backstop that had formed the bulk of the opposition to Theresa Mayâ€™s Brexit plan among hardcore Brexit supporters. He planned a straight up or down vote â€” support this deal or not â€” this weekend, until Sir Oliver Letwin, an independent MP, introduced an amendment that destroyed the governmentâ€™s plans.
MPs backed, 322-306, an amendment that essentially postponed the final decision on Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal until the accompanying legislation â€” known as the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) â€” was also passed into law. Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal is a treaty with the EU so it needs to be passed into domestic law. Which means two things technically need to happen before October 31: a vote approving the Brexit deal (the â€œmeaningful voteâ€ MPs awarded themselves in 2018) and another approving all the legislation.
MPs worried that, with less than two weeks to scrutinize this generation-defining legislation, something might go awry, so they wanted to bake in more time â€” if necessary â€” for reviewing and voting on the bill. In other words, they forced Johnson to ask for a three-month extension whether or not his Brexit deal passed.
Johnson, of course, staked his premiership on the promise that the UK would leave the EU by October 31, so he doesnâ€™t want to seek another delay. It also put off the moment of reckoning: whether Parliament will ultimately back his deal or deliver him a defeat, as it did his predecessor.
Johnson sent a letter to the EU because he had to. Then he sent another letter to the EU because he wanted to.
Johnson, after the Letwin vote, said he would not seek an extension and still try to leave on October 31. The problem is, however, Johnson is bound by law to at least ask the EU for a Brexit extension â€” and there didnâ€™t seem to be any obvious loophole to get out of it.
So Johnson begrudgingly sent a letter seeking a delay until January 31, 2020, but he did not sign it. In a second letter, which he did sign, Johnson basically said, â€œEven though I was forced to ask for an extension, I think we can get this done by October 31.â€
â€œAlthough I would have preferred a different result today, the government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week,â€ he wrote. â€œI remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October.â€ (A third letter, from Britainâ€™s ambassador to the EU, was also included.)
European Council President Donald Tusk said it had received the extension letter and itâ€™s consulting with EU leaders on how to react. The Scottish courts are currently reviewing whether Johnsonâ€™s second letter was an attempt to block an extension but it looks like the EU is going to basically ignore the stunt and continue to consider whether to extend Brexit or not.
All 27 EU leaders must unanimously agree, and itâ€™s likely they will grant some sort of extension, as the EU doesnâ€™t want to be seen as forcing a no-deal Brexit. But it looks like the EU isnâ€™t rushing to make a decision, either; leaders are going to wait a bit to see how the Brexit debate plays out in Parliament this week â€” which means this could come down to the wire. For now, the Brexit deadline remains October 31.
Thousands marched for a second referendum
As this drama was going on in Parliament, hundreds of thousands of Brits marched to demand another vote on Brexit.
Supporters of a second referendum â€” led by the â€œPeopleâ€™s Voteâ€ campaign â€” argue that UK citizens didnâ€™t really know what they were voting for in June 2016 when they were asked to choose between â€œleaveâ€ or â€œremain.â€ Now that theyâ€™ve seen the reality â€” specifically, Boris Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal â€” citizens should have another say as to whether this is the Brexit they want or whether it should be scrapped altogether.
But a second referendum â€” or confirmatory vote, as itâ€™s called â€” is very tricky. Parliament has discussed such a confirmatory vote, which would put the Brexit deal (first Mayâ€™s, now Johnsonâ€™s) back to the people. For one, it could take months to pull off, forcing a much longer Brexit extension, if one is even available.
Thereâ€™s also no clarity on how the question might be phrased: Would it be a choice between Borisâ€™s deal and remaining in the EU? Or would it be a clean 2016 do-over of Leave versus Remain? Could a referendum offer three choices: remain, leave without a deal, or Johnsonâ€™s deal? And then what happens if the catastrophic no-deal outcome wins?
Brexiteers argue a second referendum would be undemocratic, an attempt to undo the will of the people as evinced in 2016. Proponents of a second referendum say that the beauty of democracy is being able to change oneâ€™s mind, especially when the circumstances change.
Meanwhile, UK politicians are wary about backing a second referendum. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party has offered a muddled message on a second referendum, despite many in his party wanting him to support it. But Labour has Leave voters within its ranks, too, and the political risk to Corbyn is real.
Some Labour MPs are expected to table an amendment to the Brexit deal legislation that would call for a second referendum, but itâ€™s not clear it will have the votes to succeed as MPs have been hesitant to support it outright. So far, Parliament voted just to see how much support a second referendum would have among MPs, and it rejected such a plan 280-292. Some months (and protests) later, Parliamentâ€™s reluctance to back a second referendum hasnâ€™t budged all that much.
Speaker of the House John Bercow said Boris Johnson canâ€™t get another vote on his deal just yet
After a pretty rough weekend, Johnson got some more bad news on Monday. Speaker of the House John Bercow, whoâ€™s spoiled the governmentâ€™s plans a few times during Brexit, ruled that Johnson couldnâ€™t bring his Brexit deal for another vote on Monday because it would be â€œrepetitive and disorderly to do so.â€
Bercowâ€™s decision isnâ€™t all that surprising: He made a similar call when it came to Mayâ€™s attempt to bring her Brexit deal again. He argued, as Parliamentâ€™s de facto arbiter, that the motion â€” to vote on the Brexit deal â€” â€œis in substance the same as Saturdayâ€™s motion, and the house has decided the matter.â€ In other words, the House voted to withhold approval until all the legislation has passed; thereâ€™d be no point in bringing the first matter to a vote again.
Johnson probably knew this was going to be the verdict, too, and may have just been trying to make a point to his supporters and Brexiteers that Parliament and their spoiler of a Speaker (whoâ€™s set to retire October 31, incidentally) is just trying to frustrate Brexit. (Bercow himself doesnâ€™t vote.) This was a minor, not entirely unexpected, setback for Johnson. But the real drama is expected Tuesday.
The Brexit deal legislation could be voted on as early as Tuesday. Parliament wants some tweaks.
Parliament said on Saturday that it wanted to defer a final decision on the Brexit deal until all that legislation is passed.
On Monday, Johnsonâ€™s government published the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill that would put the Brexit deal into law. Itâ€™s 115 pages, and MPs are still poring over it â€” with many already complaining that this process is being rushed, especially since the government hasnâ€™t even published an economic assessment yet. Also, the bill repeals the law that requires a â€œmeaningful voteâ€ for the Brexit deal, meaning the actual vote on the agreement would no longer have to happen. Once (or if) this bill becomes law, at least from the UK side, Brexit can happen.
And MPs are expected to be voting on â€œsecond readingâ€ of the bill on Tuesday. Thereâ€™s still a few more processes to go through before it becomes law, but as the Guardian points out, it will be a good test of support on where Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal stands â€” and whether the UK actually needs an extension or might be able to pass all the legislation before October 31.
The problem is, once it enters this next phase, MPs can start adding amendments. Opposition lawmakers are already trying to figure out ways to spoil the legislation so that it would definitely need more time to pass, thereby pushing the EU toward postponing Brexit. Or, MPs might amend it in such a way that Johnson wouldnâ€™t want the legislation to pass in that form so heâ€™ll scrap it altogether.
MPs are chewing over two possibilities: an amendment that would seek to keep the UK within the EU customs union and another that would require a second referendum before any Brexit deal can be approved.
Thereâ€™s no way Johnson would support an amendment that locked the UK into the EU customs union, which avoids tariffs and duties among EU states and has the bloc trade as one unit with the rest of the world. A customs union would prevent Britain from pursuing the independent trade deals that it wants, so Brexiteers like Johnson wonâ€™t tolerate it â€” which means he likely wonâ€™t proceed with the domestic legislation.
A second referendum amendment could make approval for Johnsonâ€™s deal dependent on a national vote, something Johnson definitely wonâ€™t want, either.
Johnson doesnâ€™t have a majority in Parliament, which is why MPs keep blocking his agenda. But that doesnâ€™t mean there is enough support for a customs union (the EU would have to go for this, too) or a second referendum â€” even among MPs who might be wary of Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal.
Back in April, in the same vote where MPs decided they didnâ€™t back a second referendum, a vote for staying in the customs union came very close to gaining support, 273-276. Whether it could prevail this week is an open question, but if it did, Johnsonâ€™s Brexit plans would be in tatters. Labour is trying to rally support, particularly for the customs union, but itâ€™s likely going to need the backing of Conservative MPs who were kicked out of the party last month for openly defying Johnson. And thatâ€™s not going to be an easy task because while many donâ€™t want a no-deal Brexit, they have their limits when it comes to how closely theyâ€™ll work with the Labour party.
So this week will be another showdown between the prime minister and Parliament. Thereâ€™s Johnson, whoâ€™s desperately trying to cobble together support for his Brexit deal and the accompanying legislation so the UK and EU can divorce by the end of the month. And then thereâ€™s Parliament, caught in the middle, with some eager to support Johnsonâ€™s deal, some opposed, and some who see their chance to block Brexit running out."
"â€œI agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing,â€ Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said at the Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday night. â€œAbortion should be safe, legal, and rare.â€
Clinton used this language in her 2008 presidential campaign; Bill Clinton, meanwhile, had introduced it into Democratic politics back in 1992. The language was likely meant to appeal to people who supported the right to an abortion in principle but still felt morally conflicted about the procedure â€” a large group, according to some polling. But many abortion rights advocates argued that calling for the procedure to be â€œrareâ€ placed stigma on people who seek it.
â€œThereâ€™s a fundamental notion of bodily autonomy that weâ€™ve been fighting for as advocates and activists on this issue for years,â€ Destiny Lopez, co-director of the All* Above All Action Fund, a nonprofit that works to expand abortion access, told Vox. Saying abortion should be rare â€œcompletely negates all the work that weâ€™ve done to really make this about the ability to decide whatâ€™s best for your body, for your family, for your community,â€ she said.
Over the years, Democrats have become more sympathetic to this view. By 2016, Hillary Clinton had changed her message, saying only that abortion should be â€œsafe and legal.â€ It was part of a broader shift in the party toward more full-throated support of abortion rights. During the 2016 primaries, both Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders called for a repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. Today, all the Democratic presidential candidates, including Gabbard, support allowing federal funding for the procedure â€” along with a slate of other reforms aimed at increasing access.
But as Gabbard showed, the framing of â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ isnâ€™t gone. Her comment, and the conversation surrounding it, were a reminder not just of how much the Democratic Party has changed in recent years on abortion rights, but of the divisions that still remain.
Democratic politicians have been moving away from â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ since 2012
The phrase â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ entered common usage during the 1992 campaign, when Bill Clinton frequently used it, according to the New York Times. â€œWe have to remind the American people once again that being pro-choice is very different from being pro-abortion,â€ he told the Congressional Womenâ€™s Caucus that year.
During her 2008 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton echoed her husbandâ€™s message, emphasizing that â€œby rare, I mean rare.â€
But over the years, abortion rights advocates have pushed back against the phrase. â€œSafe, legal, and rareâ€ implies that getting an abortion is something that â€œyou should be apologetic for,â€ reproductive justice activist Renee Bracey Sherman told Vox. â€œIt places the blame on the person whoâ€™s had an abortion, as if they just did something wrong to need one, rather than addressing the systemic issue as to why someone might not be able to have access to consistent health care or contraception.â€
The push to destigmatize abortion has been part of a larger rise in people who have had abortions being open about their experiences.
â€œPrior to 2016, we did not have a lot of people publicly saying the word abortionâ€ or talking about their first-hand experiences, Lopez told Vox. But â€œthere has just been this seismic shiftâ€ in the last few years â€œwhere weâ€™ve seen more public conversations about the realities of abortion access in this country.â€
Those realities have changed a lot since 1992. Opponents of abortion have long sought to restrict the procedure, but after 2010, when Republicans took over many state legislatures, they successfully passed a slate of restrictions on abortion clinics that caused many facilities in the South and Midwest to close. Between 2011 and 2017, half of the clinics in Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas shut their doors. In 2017, 89 percent of counties had no abortion clinic, and six states had just one.
That made it much harder for many Americans to get an abortion, especially if they couldnâ€™t afford to travel to a far-away clinic.
Meanwhile, Trumpâ€™s election in 2016 was soon followed by the appointment of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Many advocates on both sides of the issue believe that conservatives on the Court now have enough votes, if not to overturn the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade, then at least to significantly weaken it. Earlier this month, the Court announced it would take a case that could give states the green light to pass even more clinic restrictions, possibly legislating clinics out of existence.
In a time when access is dwindling and Roe is at risk, advocates have argued that calling for abortion to be â€œrareâ€ just makes it even harder for people who already struggle to get the procedure â€” who are disproportionately likely to be poor, people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants, or belong to more than one of these groups â€” to push for their right to get it.
â€œIf there are barriers put in front of a person,â€ the â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ framing implies â€œthat it does not matter because that procedure should be rare,â€ Lopez said. â€œSo it essentially is denying these folks the ability to really access the care that they deserve.â€
For that reason, the All* Above All Action Fund says that abortion should be â€œsafe, legal, accessible, and affordable,â€ not rare, Lopez said.
Democratic candidates have been listening to concerns like these, and in recent years, theyâ€™ve moved away from â€œsafe, legal, and rare.â€ The word â€œrareâ€ was removed from the Democratic party platform in 2012, Bracey Sherman said, and in 2016, Clinton no longer used it on the campaign trail.
A discussion of abortion in her 2017 book What Happened showed how much the former candidateâ€™s language had changed on the issue. â€œWe can debate the morality of abortion forever,â€ Clinton wrote, â€œbut at the end of the day, who decides whether a woman gets or stays pregnant?â€
Her answer: â€œI say let women decide.â€
Clintonâ€™s shift was part of a bigger move in the Democratic Party toward more outspoken and less equivocal support of abortion rights. In particular, advocates had been calling for a repeal of Hyde for years because the amendment, first passed in 1976, blocks Medicaid coverage for almost all abortions. As a result, many low-income Americans are blocked from getting the procedure or forced to go into debt or forego necessities to pay for it.
In 2016, the Democratic Party added a call to repeal Hyde to its official platform. Today, all the Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination say they support allowing federal money to pay for abortions. Even former Vice President Joe Biden, who earlier this year supported leaving Hyde in place, now calls for its repeal.
The move to repeal Hyde and the move away from â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ are linked, Bracey Sherman said. â€œThis is just a general shift in moving away from stigmatizing people who need and have abortions.â€
Despite the shift, divisions on abortion remain among Democrats
But â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ isnâ€™t completely gone. Gabbard â€” who once identified as pro-life but now says she supports abortion rights â€” used the phrase at the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday night, when she was asked how she would stop states from restricting abortion access.
â€œWe see how the consequences of laws that youâ€™re referring to can often lead to a dangerous place,â€ Gabbard went on. â€œI do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.â€
Many abortion rights advocates criticized her response, but one â€” former Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen â€” praised her, arguing that â€œwe should reduce the need for abortions by investing in prevention.â€
Wen broke with other abortion rights advocates some time ago. When she was removed as Planned Parenthoodâ€™s president in July, she said in a statement that, â€œI believe that the best way to protect abortion care is to be clear that it is not a political issue but a health care one.â€ Some said the group ousted her because it was looking for â€œa more aggressive political leaderâ€ on abortion rights, while others said she had management issues.
Since she left Planned Parenthood, Wen has argued that the best way to build public support for abortion rights is to seek common ground with people who may be uncomfortable with the procedure, but want it to remain legal. She wrote in a New York Times op-ed shortly after her departure that while leading the group, â€œI reached out to people who wrestle with abortionâ€™s moral complexities, but who will speak out against government interference in personal medical decisions.â€
â€œWe need to stop treating those whose views differ from our own with scorn and suspicion, and instead work together to safeguard our health, our rights and our future,â€ she concluded.
And after Tuesdayâ€™s debate, Wen made clear that she saw the â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ framing as a way to reach out to people with different views on the issue. â€œPro-choice & progressive movements will lose unless we allow more people to join who do not agree 100% with the most extreme ideology,â€ she tweeted. (Wen declined, through a representative, to be interviewed for this story.)
She isnâ€™t the only abortion-rights supporter to use â€œsafe, legal, and rareâ€ in recent months. In an interview with NPRâ€™s Sarah McCammon earlier this year, Pamela Maraldo, a former president of Planned Parenthood who resigned in 1995 under circumstances similar to Wenâ€™s, said that she wanted Planned Parenthood to return to that framing.
â€œI think that people that are pro-choice are afraid of stigmatizing abortion when they say it should be rare,â€ she said. But â€œthatâ€™s not where Iâ€™m coming from. Iâ€™m coming from a place that too many trips to the doctorâ€™s, medical procedures, surgical procedures, could be and should be prevented.â€
In general, those who argue on behalf of prevention say that better access to contraception would naturally lead to abortion becoming rarer. Indeed, the abortion rate has hit an all-time low in recent years, and experts say better access to long-acting reversible contraceptives like IUDs is likely the reason why.
But moves by the Trump administration, like increased restrictions on Title X family planning funding and a weakening of the mandate that employer-based insurance cover birth control, could threaten access to contraception, especially among low-income Americans.
Even if access were perfect, â€œcontraception is not foolproof,â€ Lopez said. â€œPeople will always need abortion care in this country, period.â€
The disagreement between Wen and other activists, and among Gabbard and other candidates, is a reminder that even among people who generally support abortion rights, there are a lot of differences in approach and priorities.
Thatâ€™s why advocates like Bracey Sherman, who started the hashtag #AskAboutAbortion in 2016, have been pushing for moderators to ask questions about abortion rights in Democratic debates. Tuesday was the first time in four presidential debates (two of them spread across two nights) that moderators asked anything about abortion, Lopez noted.
â€œFor so long we heard, â€˜well, theyâ€™re all pro-choice, it doesnâ€™t really matter,â€™â€ Bracey Sherman said. On Tuesday night, though, â€œit was clear: they actually donâ€™t all have the same stance.â€"
"Itâ€™s impossible to talk about the causes of Americaâ€™s opioid epidemic without pointing to the manufacturers and distributors that marketed and proliferated dangerous opioid painkillers. Yet for much of the crisis, these multibillion dollar opioid companies have avoided much in the way of serious accountability.
Until, perhaps, now.
Last month, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, tentatively agreed to pay as much as $12 billion to settle lawsuits it faces for its role in the opioid crisis. It would be the largest settlement related to the epidemic, which has contributed to the more than 700,000 drug overdose deaths in the US since 1999.
More settlements could come, with discussions currently underway with opioid makers and distributors.
The settlements are part of a federal case in Cleveland in which more than 2,000 lawsuits, largely from various levels of government, have been consolidated in an effort to reach a single landmark legal resolution to the opioid epidemic â€” forcing not just opioid makers like Purdue but also distributors like CVS and Walgreens to help pay for the drug addiction and overdose crisis.
Other cases, however, are proceeding as well. Attorneys general in Connecticut and Massachusetts, for example, have said that they didnâ€™t agree to the Purdue settlement and vowed to continue with their own cases against opioid makers and distributors, including Purdue. Oklahoma recently concluded cases against Purdue, Johnson & Johnson, and Teva.
There are two major legal arguments behind these cases, one against opioid manufacturers and another mainly against opioid distributors:
1) Starting in the mid-1990s, opioid manufacturers unleashed a misleading marketing push underplaying the risks of opioid painkillers and exaggerating the drugsâ€™ benefits. This, the lawsuits argue, adds up to false advertising with deadly consequences by encouraging doctors to overprescribe the pills and getting patients to think the pills were safe and effective.
2) Meanwhile, opioid distributors supplied a ton of these pills, even when they should have known they were going to people who were misusing the drugs. This is backed by data showing that, in some counties and states, there were more prescribed bottles of painkillers than there were people â€” a sign that something was going very wrong. Federal and some state laws require distributors to keep an eye on the supply chain to ensure their products arenâ€™t falling into the wrong hands. Letting these drugs proliferate, the lawsuits say, violates those laws.
Opioid manufacturers and distributors, of course, deny these allegations. While some lawsuits have been settled and some executives have even been criminally convicted for their involvement in the epidemic in the past, opioid companies vigorously reject the argument that they have carelessly fueled the current drug crisis. And so far, what the companies have paid by and large amounts to a fraction of the revenue theyâ€™ve taken in from the drugs.
More than 70,000 people died of drug overdoses in 2017, and around two-thirds of those deaths were linked to opioids. While these deaths are increasingly linked to illicit opioids like heroin and fentanyl, the rise in opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose originally began with the proliferation of prescription painkillers â€” which were overprescribed by doctors, allowing the drugs to flow not just to patients but to the friends and family of patients, teens rummaging through parentsâ€™ medicine cabinets, and the black market. (For more on the causes of the crisis, read Voxâ€™s explainer.)
According to the lawsuits, opioid companies enabled this epidemic. So they should pay up.
The case against opioid makers: false advertising
The big argument against opioid makers: These companies knew or should have known that their products werenâ€™t safe or effective, yet they advertised their drugs as safe and effective anyway.
One lawsuit representative of this line of argument is Ohioâ€™s, which goes after Purdue; Endo; Teva and subsidiary Cephalon; Johnson & Johnson and subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals; and Allergan.
The lawsuit cited several examples of misleading marketing: An Endo-sponsored website, PainKnowledge.com, in 2009 claimed that â€œ[p]eople who take opioids as prescribed usually do not become addicted.â€ Janssen approved and distributed a patient education guide in 2009 that attempted to counter the â€œmythâ€ that opioids are addictive, claiming that â€œ[m]any studies show that opioids are rarely addictive when used properly for the management of chronic pain.â€ Purdue sponsored a publication from the American Pain Foundation, which was heavily funded by opioid companies, claiming that the risk of addiction is less than 1 percent among children prescribed opioids â€” suggesting pain is undertreated and opioids are necessary.
This is only a small sampling. In total, former Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine claimed opioid companies spent â€œmillions of dollars on promotional activities and materials that falsely deny or trivialize the risks of opioids while overstating the benefits of using them for chronic pain.â€ In doing this, he argued that opioid makers were â€œborrowing a page from Big Tobaccoâ€™s playbook.â€
A 2015 analysis in the Annual Review of Public Health reached similar conclusions, finding opioid makers exaggerated the benefits and safety of their products; supported advocacy groups and â€œeducationâ€ campaigns to encourage widespread use of opioids; and lobbied lawmakers to loosen access to the drugs.
The result: As opioid companies saw their profits increase, so too did drug overdose deaths and addiction treatment admissions.
Annual Review of Public Health
Itâ€™s not just that opioids arenâ€™t as safe as the drug companies claimed, itâ€™s that the drugs may not even be as effective. Thereâ€™s simply no good scientific evidence that opioid painkillers can effectively treat long-term chronic pain as patients grow tolerant of opioidsâ€™ effects, but thereâ€™s plenty of evidence that prolonged use can result in bad complications, including a higher risk of addiction, overdose, and death. In short, the risks outweigh the benefits for most chronic pain patients.
Some opioid makers had to pay earlier on in the crisis for what the government described as false advertising. In 2007, Purdue and three of its top executives paid more than $630 million in federal fines for misleading marketing, and three executives were criminally convicted, each sentenced to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service.
But local, state, and federal governments, as well as individuals and activist groups, argue that the faulty marketing continued even after that, leading more people to file legal action against opioid makers. Some states, such as Oklahoma and Kentucky, have already gotten a payout. Purdue reportedly agreed to settle thousands of cases in front of a federal court in Cleveland. Yet other cases, including against other opioid makers as well as Purdue, remain.
I previously reached out to the major companies named in the lawsuits. Only Purdue gave a comment on the record, denying a major role in fueling the opioid crisis.
The case against opioid distributors: allowing diversion
Beyond the false advertising charges, thereâ€™s a separate legal argument, dubbed the â€œdiversion theoryâ€ by some proponents, for companies that distribute, as opposed to manufacture, opioids.
Under federal and some state laws, opioid distributors have a legal obligation to stop controlled substances from going to illicit purposes and misuse. The diversion theory argues that these distributors clearly did not do that: As the opioid epidemic spiraled out of control and as some counties and states had more prescriptions than people, it should have become perfectly clear that something was going wrong â€” yet, the claim goes, distributors continued to let the drugs proliferate.
Michael Canty, an attorney advising states and other jurisdictions on opioid-related legal challenges, drew a comparison between opioid distributors and credit card companies.
â€œ[Credit card companies say], â€˜Someone tried to make a very large purchase on your account in another state and we flagged it as suspicious and stopped it from going through.â€™ Thatâ€™s what distributors should be doing,â€ Canty previously told me. â€œFor example, thereâ€™s a small town with 500 residents, and the local pharmacies order a million pills from the distributors. That should set off an alarm bell from a compliance standpoint or a quality control standpoint, where the distributors say, â€˜Wait a minute, whatâ€™s going on here? We need to investigate this order. And until it passes muster, we wonâ€™t ship.â€™â€
The Cherokee Nationâ€™s lawsuit is representative of this line of argument, leveled against big names like the McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen, CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart. The lawsuit has some fairly alarming numbers behind its claim: 845 million milligrams of opioids were distributed in the 14 counties that make up the Cherokee Nation â€” which, if you assume an average pill size of 20 milligrams, amounts to 360 pills for each person using prescription opioids in the Cherokee Nation.
This is part of a national problem. The CDC, for example, put out 2012 data that found there were more painkiller prescriptions than people in several states.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
West Virginiaâ€™s case is particularly striking. It is the state hardest hit by the epidemic, suffering the highest rate of overdose deaths in recent years. A previous investigation by the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia found that from 2007 to 2012, drug firms poured a total of 780 million painkillers into the state â€” which has a total population of about 1.8 million. Some of the numbers were even more absurd at the local level: The small town of Kermit has a population of 392, but a single pharmacy there received 9 million hydrocodone pills over two years from out-of-state drug companies.
â€œWhen you have 140 prescriptions being written for every 100 people, you know that people have failed to meet their obligations,â€ Serena Hallowell, another attorney involved in the legal challenges, previously told me. â€œAnd theyâ€™re not just ethical obligations, which I would say they have too. Theyâ€™re obligations under state and federal law and their own industry guidelines as well.â€
As with opioid makers, distributors have already paid some fines and settlements for the opioid crisis, sometimes multiple times over â€” including McKesson, CVS, Walgreens, and Cardinal Health. Now legal challenges are wrapped up in the consolidation of lawsuits in Cleveland, although some individual lawsuits are still going on across the country.
Similar challenges could, in theory, be tried against opioid manufacturers too. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), for one, previously pursued one of the nationâ€™s largest opioid makers, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, for the proliferation of its pills in Florida since 1999. But as the Washington Post found, the investigations went nowhere. In the end, the company agreed to pay, without admitting wrongdoing, just $35 million to settle the case with the federal government â€” far from the billions of dollars the DEA reportedly hoped for, and a tiny fraction of the $3.4 billion in revenue the company reported in fiscal year 2016.
I previously contacted the opioid distributors named in the lawsuits. AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and CVS said theyâ€™re committed to stopping the misuse of their products and that they will work closely with federal regulators to do so. Cardinal Health went further, arguing that it â€œis confident that the facts and the law are on our side, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the plaintiffâ€™s mischaracterization of those facts and misunderstanding of the law.â€
Some advocates want much more than a legal settlement
With the lawsuits, the hope has always been that state and local governments could land a massive legal settlement, similar to the settlement reached with big tobacco companies in the 1990s.
In 1998, big tobacco companies agreed to the Master Settlement Agreement with 46 states. This massive agreement forced tobacco companies to pay tens of billions in upfront and then annual payments, and it put major restrictions on the sale and marketing of tobacco products.
Similarly, a big settlement with drug companies could place restrictions on marketing for opioids. Money from the lawsuits could also help pay for addiction treatment. The latter would help fill a major gap in care: According to a 2016 report from the surgeon general, only 10 percent of people with a drug use disorder get specialty treatment â€” in large part due to a lack of access and options in their area.
Purdueâ€™s tentative settlement moves in this direction. According to the Washington Post and New York Times, Purdue will file for bankruptcy and effectively dissolve. Then a new company will form and continue selling OxyContin, with the sales revenue going to plaintiffs in the lawsuit settlement. Purdue will donate drugs for addiction treatment and overdose as well. All of that could help pay for potentially billions in treatment.
But some advocates arenâ€™t satisfied. For one, the $10 billion to $12 billion settlement makes up a small part of the more than $31 billion in revenue that, as of 2016, Purdue had made from OxyContin. And even though the Sackler family that owns Purdue will reportedly have to pay $3 billion as part of the settlement, the Sacklers will still walk away as billionaires.
And a $12 billion payment doesnâ€™t actually pay for the full costs of the opioid crisis. One study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the total economic burden of prescription opioid overdose, misuse, and addiction at $78.5 billion in 2013 â€” about a third of which is due to higher health care and addiction treatment costs. Another study from the White House Council of Economic Advisers linked a year of the opioid crisis to $500 billion in economic losses.
There are also questions about whether the money from settlements will actually go to addiction treatment. Much of the money meant for tobacco addiction treatment in the Master Settlement Agreement ended up going to other things, like filling state budgets.
So some critics have demanded not just financial consequences but prison time for opioid makers as well â€” to ensure that, if nothing else, thereâ€™s actual accountability. â€œIf no Sacklers end up behind bars, an entire class of people will continue to feel that writing a check is the worst thing that will happen to them ever no [matter] what they do,â€ Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford, said on Twitter.
One complicating factor in the case against opioid makers and distributors: Unlike tobacco companies, they canâ€™t be held solely liable for the opioid crisis. Unlike cigarettes at the time of the Master Settlement Agreement, opioids are already regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This could let opioid companies punt responsibility to the FDA, since the agency approved these drugs for medical use. Jodi Avergun, a former chief of staff at the DEA and now a defense lawyer, told Reuters that this is a â€œfundamental weaknessâ€ of the opioid lawsuits.
Thereâ€™s also the involvement of the rest of the health care system in the opioid crisis, from medical boards to doctors to patients themselves. That all of this involved so many different actors could insulate opioid companies from carrying too much of the legal consequences. Thatâ€™s especially true since some of these other actors have copped to serious negligence; the West Virginia Board of Pharmacy, for example, admitted that it didnâ€™t enforce a law for reporting suspicious orders of narcotics for years.
â€œWith tobacco, it really is an interaction between an industry and the consumer,â€ Humphreys previously told me. â€œIn this case, there was supposed to be this intervening body that also failed. That doesnâ€™t mean the pharmaceutical companies should get off, but â€¦ plenty of other people enabled it.â€
Still, some opioid makers and distributors are starting to feel the consequences. Whether those consequences will be enough to make a dent in the opioid crisis remains to be seen."
"The European Union and the United Kingdom have a Brexit deal â€” again.
After days of furious negotiations, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâ€™s government and the EU achieved a revised agreement that would take the UK out of the EU. The two sides had been at a stalemate for months, but they achieved a late breakthrough just two weeks before the Brexit deadline of October 31.
â€œWeâ€™ve got a great new deal that takes back control â€” now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities,â€ Johnson announced.
EU leaders expressed similar optimism. â€œWhere there is a will, there is a #deal - we have one! Itâ€™s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions,â€ Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, announced Thursday on Twitter.
But although both the UK and the EU are signaling victory, this is definitely not a done deal yet. EU leaders have signed off. But Johnson still needs to get it through a Parliament where heâ€™s lost his majority.
That means the prime minister needs to get everyone who voted for former Prime Minister Theresa Mayâ€™s deal on board with his new agreement â€” and then some, from the hardcore Brexiteer holdouts, to the Conservative members who either defected or got kicked out of the party last month, to a handful of opposition Labour Party members.
Complicating matters: It looks like Northern Irelandâ€™s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) wonâ€™t be handing Johnson its 10 votes because they oppose this version of the Brexit deal.
Parliament is supposed to be sitting for a marathon â€œSuper Saturdayâ€ session this weekend during which the fate of Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal is likely to be determined â€” along with, perhaps, the future of Britain.
What to know about this â€œgreatâ€ new Brexit deal
The EU and the UK made changes to both the withdrawal agreement â€” the divorce settlement that sets the terms of the breakup and sets up a post-Brexit transition period â€” and the political declaration, which lays out the prospect of the future relationship between the EU and the UK.
Whatâ€™s changed in the withdrawal agreement is the format for the so-called â€œIrish backstop,â€ which has been the major sticking point in the Brexit deal for the better part of the past year.
To recap, the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as itâ€™s technically called, is a safeguard in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to guarantee that, no matter what happens with the future EU-UK relationship, the border between Northern Ireland (which is part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which is an EU member-state) remains free of infrastructure and physical checks on goods.
This commitment was seen as vital to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Thatâ€™s because that border was heavily militarized during the Troubles, the decades-long conflict in Northern Ireland between â€œnationalists,â€ who identified more closely with Ireland and sought a united Ireland, and â€œunionists,â€ who identified more closely with Britain and wanted to remain part of the UK.
During that period, the border became both a symbol of the divide and a very real target for nationalist paramilitary groups such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
A 1998 peace deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement, formally ended the conflict. That agreement included greater cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which meant softening the border between the two. Today, that border is all but invisible.
Then the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016. That meant that once the UK left, the Irish border wouldnâ€™t just separate Northern Ireland and Ireland anymore â€” it would be the dividing line between the EU and the UK. And since the two would have different rules and regulations for trade and commerce, there would have to be some sort of inspection stations or checkpoints established on that border.
That led many to fear that a â€œhardâ€ physical border would have to once again be erected, potentially refueling violence. And, indeed, the New IRA â€” an armed paramilitary group that splintered off of the IRA â€” said just this week that any Brexit-related border infrastructure would be considered â€œa legitimate target for attack and armed actionsâ€ by its members. It would also be extraordinarily damaging for the economy on the island of Ireland, which is closely intertwined.
How to balance the two positions â€” the UKâ€™s desire to leave and the need to keep the Irish border open â€” has been the impossible issue of Brexit. So the two sides came up with a fudge: the â€œbackstop.â€ Under the plan agreed to by May and the EU last year, the entire United Kingdom would remain part of the EU customs union, which would have kept all of Britain in the same trading scheme as the EU.
But this was unacceptable to Brexiteers who wanted to full break with EU rules and institutions, and so they kept voting down the deal.
So now thereâ€™s a replacement backstop, if you will.
This new plan will instead keep only Northern Ireland closely aligned with the EU rules, specifically on goods. This avoids any checks on the island of Ireland, though they will still have to happen on goods moving to or from the island of Ireland from the rest of Britain.
But the whole of the United Kingdom â€” including Northern Ireland â€” will get to leave the EU customs union. The arrangements are kind of complicated â€” for example, the UK will have to apply and collect EU tariffs if any goods going from the rest of Britain are at risk of entering Ireland, otherwise known as EU territory.
So there are clearly some things to be worked out here; but all of the UK leaving the customs union means it can negotiate independent trade deals (something thatâ€™s really important to Brexiteers). It also means Johnson can say (and maybe run an election on the fact) that he took all of the UK out of the EU customs union, a big reason many opposed the previous Brexit deal.
Another addition to this version of the deal is the ability for the Northern Irish government to have a say. The Assembly in Northern Ireland will be able to vote to continue the arrangements four years after they go into effect. (Thatâ€™s 2021 or 2023, depending on how long the transition lasts.) It will just need a simple majority, rather than needing the majority of unionists and nationalists, which avoids one group getting a veto.
Northern Ireland hasnâ€™t had a government since 2017, and if that continues, then the arrangements will remain until one is in place to vote on them. If Stormont (what NIâ€™s seat of government is called) decides to exit this setup at any point, thereâ€™s a two year grace-period before it officially ends, ideally to work out another alternative.
There are other components of the deal, but these are the key elements. This setup sounds just a little bit like the original Northern Ireland-only backstop plan the EU had first proposed, which former Prime Minister May had previously said was unacceptable.
But both the EU and the UK made concessions. The EU stayed firm on its position that safeguards needed to be in place for the Irish border, and Johnson got the UK out of the EUâ€™s regulatory regime. Itâ€™s an imperfect deal, but, for now, both sides can sell it as a win.
Everything else in the withdrawal bill is pretty much unchanged, and the same as what May brought back last year. Johnson did get some tweaks to the political declaration, which sets the framework for future negotiations on the EU-UK relationship. While thereâ€™s still likely something for everyone to hate, the political declaration points to a future relationship built on a much harder Brexit, rather than close alignment with EU rules.
So thatâ€™s it, right? Johnson â€œgot Brexit doneâ€ before the October 31 deadline?
Well, not exactly.
New Brexit deal, same old Parliament
â€œI do think this deal represents a very good deal for the EU and the UK,â€ Johnson said in Brussels on Thursday, after the agreement had been reached.
But now the prime minister has to sell the deal to Parliament. And thatâ€™s not going to be easy.
Mayâ€™s Brexit deal was defeated three times. Johnson has scrapped its most controversial element, which should win him the support of some of the hardcore Brexiteers who previously rejected Mayâ€™s deal.
The problem for Johnson right now is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The DUP says it will oppose Johnsonâ€™s plan because it treats Northern Ireland differently than the rest of the UK. â€œThese proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of our Union,â€ the party wrote in a statement.
The DUP used to have an outsized voice in this debate, because its 10 votes gave the Conservative government its majority. But since Johnson has lost his majority anyway, their influence has waned â€” but their opposition could still deter some Conservatives. And these are 10 votes that he canâ€™t really afford to lose.
Still, Johnson may be confident that heâ€™ll be able to win back some of the Conservative defectors and peel off some Labour members who represent Leave-voting districts. But the math is going to be very, very tight for probably one of the most consequential political decisions MPs will have to make.
Parliament is expected to vote on Johnsonâ€™s deal Saturday.
This will be the first time Parliament has sat on a Saturday since the 1980s and the Falkland Wars. So itâ€™s going to be momentous, and probably very complicated, because this is Brexit, and it always is.
Is the UK going to leave the EU on October 31?
If Johnsonâ€™s deal passes on Saturday, if he can get the votes, then then the UK would leave the European Union on October 31.
Maybe.
Passing a deal is just phase one. The UK will also need to implement the deal into UK law through legislation. Given that there are literally just two weeks until October 31 and this is, I donâ€™t know, quite a huge deal, it seems not unlikely that Parliament might need more time to debate. So thereâ€™s a chance that the UK will need a technical extension to get this sorted out.
But even if that happens, Johnson will have achieved what many people (including Vox) were skeptical he could achieve: a workable Brexit deal that passed Parliament. He will have gotten Brexit done.
Of course, thereâ€™s no guarantee that Johnsonâ€™s deal will pass right now.
Thatâ€™s where things get interesting.
Saturdayâ€™s date is October 19, which might sound familiar â€” that was when Johnson would be required by law to go to the EU and ask for an extension if he didnâ€™t have a new deal.
The question is how this will work now. Technically, Johnson has deal â€” but Parliament hasnâ€™t voted for it yet. Johnsonâ€™s government has previously said he will send a letter to the EU asking for an extension by October 19, but some are worried that the prime minister might try to find some legal loopholes to get around this.
The EU would have to agree to any extension. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker indicated Thursday that there would be no delay. â€œWe have concluded a deal,â€ he said. â€œSo there is not an argument for delay. It has to be done now.â€
But Juncker has no say on an extension â€” that falls to the 27 leaders of EU member-states. People like French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel â€” and, most importantly, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister. The Irish stance, for all the complicated reasons having to do with the Irish border, has always been that an extension is better than a no-deal Brexit.
Also, letâ€™s be real: The EU wants this deal to pass, too, mostly having lost hope of cancelling Brexit, and theyâ€™re not going to advertise that theyâ€™re open to giving extensions as Parliament prepares to vote. They would like MPs to act with a sense of urgency. The EU also would like to get Brexit done.
Which is to say, an extension almost certainly isnâ€™t off the table, if the UK requests one and the EU obliges. Otherwise the default will be a no-deal Brexit, where the UK crashes out on the October 31 without any arrangements in place.
And these are just some of the baseline scenarios that can happen. Parliament is probably going to fight to amend Johnsonâ€™s Brexit deal, which can lead to all kinds of things â€” including perhaps a second referendum to put Johnsonâ€™s deal back to the people. (Not even joking.)
Which is all to say, Brexit chaos is entering a new phase. But itâ€™s not close to being over."
"Here are some numbers we need to reckon with: the number of suicide deaths in people ages 15 to 24, over 36 years in the United States.
Javier Zarracina/Vox
As you can see in this chart, after a steep drop in the late 1990s, the number of suicide deaths among young people (as measured in deaths per 100,000 people) began climbing around 2010 before reaching a new high in 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The trend even holds for even those aged 10-to-14; the CDC finds suicide rates tripled among this group over the decade.
Suicide rates lately have been increasing in all age groups in America, in almost every state. But the epidemic of youth suicide is particularly stymying, even for experts who study it.
There are plenty of hypotheses about whatâ€™s driving it floating around. They include the changing way teens interact with each other in digital spaces, economic stress and fallout from the 2008 recession, increasing social isolation, suicide contagion, and the fact that teens can more easily look up suicide methods online.
Two other enormous public health issues of our time are at play too. Children of opioid users appear to be more at risk for suicide. Same goes for young people who live in a house with a gun.
But the bottom line is that no one really knows why. That doesnâ€™t mean more suicides canâ€™t be prevented, however.
For a leading cause of death (suicide is second among youth, 10th overall), the research on suicide prevention policies isnâ€™t as robust and well-funded as one might hope. Out of 295 disease research areas the National Institutes of Health funds, suicide prevention ranked 206th in 2018. Research on West Nile virus, which kills around 137 people a year, is ranked higher.
But Iâ€™ve been talking with several mental health researchers, and they all say we donâ€™t need to know the exact causes of the teen suicide trends to be able to help.
These solutions arenâ€™t easy: Some require political momentum that the country may not be able to muster. But I found that there are many concrete ways parents, mental health clinicians, and schools can help. Importantly, there are also policy solutions that can potentially contribute.
But first, I think itâ€™s useful to go through the scope of whatâ€™s happening.
Suicide deaths are just the tip of the iceberg
Suicide is a hard topic to write about.
And itâ€™s not just because of the pain and sadness that comes with contemplating so much loss. Itâ€™s because if weâ€™re not careful in writing about it, we can potentially make the problem worse. (Indeed, you might have seen a recent example: Thereâ€™s some not entirely conclusive research that the Netflix show 13 Reasons Why led more kids to suicide by, presumably, glamorizing and normalizing it.)
Worried about a teenâ€™s mental well-being? Here are some online resources to learn more about symptoms, treatment strategies, and how to help.
Effective Child Therapy is a resource from the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. The website has comprehensive information on the emotional concerns, symptoms, and disorders that commonly impact teens (divorce, bullying, body image, anxiety, depression, and more) â€” and the evidence-based therapies that can help.
The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has information for parents on how to spot symptoms of mental health issues, and where to seek help.
The Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds has educational articles on mental health issues, as well as many links for where to turn when searching for particular support groups, programs, and therapies.
The Crisis Text Line is a text messaging-based service for people enduring â€œany type of crisis.â€ And the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a phone-based service.
So thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important to state outright: While suicide rates are on the rise, that does not mean suicide is normal or common. (Learning that suicide is â€œnormalâ€ could make someone feel more comfortable with doing it themselves.) Itâ€™s still rare. In 2017, 6,241 suicide deaths occurred in people ages 15 to 24. Most were male, but an increasing number of young women are dying this way too.
Overall, around 16 percent of adolescents, the CDC reports, consider suicide in a given year. â€œThatâ€™s an epidemic,â€ says Mitch Prinstein, the director of clinical psychology at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. And the deaths are just the tip of a sorrowful iceberg. Beneath it is a rising tide of pain in young people.
For instance, the number of teens diagnosed with clinical depression grew 37 percent between 2005 and 2014. And suicide attempts â€” which are not always fatal â€” are on the rise as well. Hereâ€™s an unsettling example of that. A recent paper in the Journal of Pediatrics estimated that in 2018, close to 60,000 girls ages 10 to 18 tried to poison themselves. In 2008, that figure was closer to 30,000. Very few of these poisonings were fatal, but they represent an enormous amount of emotional trauma.
â€œWeâ€™re seeing in the schools a lot more kids having mental health difficulties, whether thatâ€™s anxiety, trauma, depression, eating disorders, emotional difficulties, a lot more,â€ says James Mazza, a University of Washington youth suicide researcher. â€œOnly a few of those are going to result in a death due to suicide. ... Our schools need to be focusing much more on mental wellness or providing kids and youth with skills to deal with the emotion disregulation theyâ€™ll experience during adolescence.â€
So, how to act?
Iâ€™ll be clear: The following solutions are not an exhaustive list. Instead, they were the most commonly mentioned in my conversations and the broadest in scope, and seem to have the most robust research in support of their effectiveness.
Restricting access to weapons and drugs can clearly prevent suicide
The simplest, bluntest, most wide-reaching policy tool to reduce suicide deaths is also the one thatâ€™s the most rarely used: simply reducing access to lethal means. If people canâ€™t access tools like firearms and drugs to harm themselves, there will be fewer deaths.
In the United States, that means gun control.
We hear a lot in the news about how guns cause incidents of mass murder or homicide. But guns are implicated in more suicides than homicides every year. â€œYouth who live in a home with access to a firearm are significantly more likely to die by suicide,â€ says Jonathan Singer, the president of the American Association of Suicidology and a professor of social work at Loyola University Chicago.
Thereâ€™s good evidence that stricter gun control would save lives in regard to suicides.
After New Zealand passed strict gun control laws in 1992, â€œfirearm-related suicides significantly decreased, particularly among youth,â€ a 2006 study found. The rates dropped among those ages 15 to 24 from four in 100,000 in the late 1980s to around one in 100,000 in the early 2000s. (And overall, research finds that when gun suicides drop, those deaths are not offset by suicides by other lethal means.)
â€œAs a population level intervention, reducing access to firearms is one of the best solutions,â€ Singer says. â€œDoes the country want to do that? No.â€
Another, simpler option is something called â€œlethal means restriction counselingâ€ for families who have a child who may be at risk for suicide. That counseling, which usually takes place in a hospital setting after a psychiatric emergency, involves discussing with parents how much access their kids have to firearms or poison, and then suggesting ways to make their homes safer.
Yet many kids (perhaps more than half, according to one study) are discharged from the hospital without their families receiving such counseling. And many are discharged into homes that contain lethal drugs and firearms.
Reducing access to lethal means isnâ€™t just limiting access to firearms. It could also mean limiting access to lethal drugs.
Confronting the opioid epidemic could mean reducing access to pills to potentially overdose on. Just having opioid drugs in the home â€” prescribed to any family member â€” is associated with an increased risk of overdose.
But itâ€™s not just prescription drugs that are potentially dangerous. Over-the-counter pain medicines can be very dangerous if taken improperly, and are the most commonly used drug in self-poisoning attempts.
â€œUntil a parent is confident that the child can manage their medication use, it should be stored and locked,â€ John Ackerman, the Suicide Prevention Coordinator at Nationwide Childrenâ€™s Hospital, says. â€œIâ€™m not saying â€˜lock it upâ€™ until theyâ€™re 18, no matter what. But treat it like a driving privilege, or something that carries significant responsibility. It needs to be taught, practiced, and earned over time.â€
Research indicates it would also be helpful to change how certain over-the-counter drugs are packaged. In the UK, when a popular over-the-counter painkiller was repackaged in blister packs (where pills have to be popped out one by one) instead of bottles (which make it easy to pour out many pills at once), it resulted in fewer overdose deaths from that drug.
Though these measures would save lives, Singer says, they donâ€™t necessarily help make people feel like they have â€œlives worth living.â€
But for that, there are some potential interventions too.
Just asking a teen if theyâ€™re feeling suicidal can help
Perhaps the most obvious place to implement policies to save the lives of young people is in schools.
For teens, â€œa third of their day is spent in the classroom,â€ Samuel Brinton, the head of advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, says. Teachers â€œhave the most likely chance of seeing the warning signs and being able to intervene appropriately,â€ Brinton says.
Ideally, Brinton outlines, schools would have three levels of prevention programs: programs to help prevent suicide broadly in the student body, programs to identify struggling kids and and intervene, and also, importantly, strategies to deal with the aftermath of a suicide or tragedy in a school to help kids cope and to make sure a suicide contagion doesnâ€™t begin.
Warning signs of suicide:
These behaviors are indicators that a person may be in acute danger and may urgently need help.
Talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself
Looking for a way to kill oneself
Talking about feeling hopeless or having no purpose
Talking about feeling trapped or being in unbearable pain
Talking about being a burden to others
Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs
Acting anxious, agitated, or reckless
Sleeping too little or too much
Withdrawing or feeling isolated
Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge
Displaying extreme mood swings
Is there a perfect off-the-shelf program to address all of these areas? Unfortunately, no. â€œThere isnâ€™t one program,â€ says Jane Pearson, chair of the Suicide Research Consortium at the National Institute of Mental Health. â€œThe field is trying to figure out how to put these things together, and figure out whatâ€™s efficient for schools to do.â€
That said, simply asking kids if theyâ€™re feeling okay, and screening them for suicide, can help.
â€œThere has long been a myth that simply asking a child whether they are suicidal might put an idea into their head and increase risk,â€ Prinstein says. â€œAnd we know now thatâ€™s completely not true.â€
Screening teens involves asking them direct questions like: Have you felt sad more days than not in the past couple of weeks? Have you ever wished you were dead? Have you had thoughts of ending your own life in the past couple of weeks?
The teens who respond â€œyesâ€ may be referred to additional counseling (in particular, dialectical behavior therapy appears to be useful in helping people deal with suicidal thoughts). A study evaluating screenings in a group of 1,000-plus ninth-graders in Connecticut found that such a screening, paired with mental health education, can reduce the number of suicide attempts in the following three months.
â€œNow, thatâ€™s only one study,â€ Singer stresses. â€œOne of the challenges with talking about, â€˜Well, whatâ€™s the evidence, whatâ€™s the data,â€™ is that weâ€™re really only in the early years of that. It takes time for programs to be developed, it takes time for school districts to be willing to do something that doesnâ€™t have an evidence base, and then it takes time and money to get the research that demonstrates that it works, or that it doesnâ€™t work.â€
Gatekeeper training can help teachers identify students in need
So many people who die by suicide have had no contact with mental health services. Schools can be a way to fill in some of the gaps.
But itâ€™s a challenge. One hurdle is that schools are run locally. Each district would need to implement programs individually. And unfortunately, not all school districts have the money or resources to do so. Also, not all parents might be comfortable with the idea of their schools asking their children about suicide. Some states have laws mandating suicide prevention training for schools and staff, but not all do.
Which is a shame because of another promising potential intervention: gatekeeper training. This is where teachers and school staff are trained to look out for and recognize students who may be at risk, and try to get them further counseling.
Thereâ€™s actually some good nationwide data on gatekeeper training, thanks to a piece of federal legislation called the Garrett Lee Smith State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention and Early Intervention Grant Program.
Itâ€™s named after a US senatorâ€™s son who died by suicide in 2003. The program provides grant money schools can use to implement many types of suicide prevention programs.
For a list of many more suicide prevention programs â€” including educational programs designed to help kids better deal with their emotions â€” and whether research backs them up, please check out this page at the Suicide Prevention Resource Center.
Overall, the program seems to have helped, regardless of what the schools spend the money on. â€œStudies have found that counties that received those grants had lower rates of youth suicide attempts and deaths by suicide than matched counties that did not receive funding,â€ a recent review article published by the American Psychological Association points out.
But in particular, data from the Garrett Lee Smith grants find that counties that employed gatekeeper training saw a one-year reduction in suicide deaths and attempts. â€œUnfortunately,â€ a recent review of suicide prevention evidence in Current Opinion in Psychology explains, the impacts â€œwere not maintained; rates of suicide and suicide attempts did not differ ... two years after the training.â€
Which means additional, ongoing trainings might be necessary, or just that itâ€™s just hard to remain vigilant for such a long period of time. Again, the research here doesnâ€™t spell out a perfect answer. But itâ€™s at least optimistic.
Again, there are other intervention options. And no single intervention needs to be used in isolation. Schools also should know thereâ€™s research that finds simply having a gay-straight alliance â€” a club that promotes inclusion of LGBTQ youth in schools, and in general, safe spaces for anyone â€” can reduce suicide risk in both teens who identify as LGBTQ (who are at higher risk for suicide than their straight peers) and those who do not. Which shows that inclusive, supportive environments matter.
Parents and adults in communities can be empowered to act too
Policies donâ€™t just need to target young people. They could also target their parents and other adults in communities to form protective safety nets.
â€œEvery parent should be talking to their child about suicide,â€ Prinstein says.
Kathryn Gordon, a clinical psychologist and researcher who recently left her academic job for a private practice, says parents can learn to â€œlisten in a nonjudgmental fashion.â€ Just listening, she says, can be a first step.
As a parent, she says, itâ€™s easy to want to jump in and start solving the problem immediately. â€œBut kids often view that as dismissive or discomfort[ing],â€ she says. â€œIf youâ€™re open and listen, often children and adolescents can start to problem solve on their own, or theyâ€™ll ask for help.â€
One of the most hopeful studies â€” which could potentially also inform policy â€” to be published recently on suicide prevention recently showed that adults can indeed make a difference in saving lives, though the results may not appear immediately.
The study involved teens who had been brought to a hospital after a suicide attempt. Those teens were asked to nominate up to four caring adults, who were then educated in how to talk to suicidal teens and how to make sure theyâ€™re adhering to treatment. After an in-person training, the adults got support over the phone for a few months to help them work through the challenges of helping a teen in trouble.
More than a decade after the intervention, the researchers checked back in on their participants by looking up death records. It turned out the teens who got the interventions more than a decade ago were less likely to have died. â€œTo our knowledge, no other intervention for suicidal adolescents has been associated with reduced mortality,â€ the study authors wrote. The results were modest, and need to be replicated.
Cheryl King, the University of Michigan suicide prevention researcher who created the intervention, suspects what makes the intervention effective is that the kids were the ones to nominate the adults. Perhaps that makes them think about the connections they have with others â€” and opens a door to strengthening them.
The intervention also instigates the adults â€” not all of whom are the childâ€™s parents â€” to be more proactive. â€œThe truth is itâ€™s not very easy for adults to go there, to reach out, to talk to and try to help suicidal teens,â€ King says. â€œWe were always reassuring that their role was just to be a caring person, and they werenâ€™t responsible for whatever choices the teen made.â€ Perhaps more programs could target parents and adults in the community to better protect youth.
Overall, I think the lesson is simple. Teens can be reminded that there are people in their lives who care about them. They feel that care at home, or at school, or ideally everywhere they go. And it can help."
"If you needed to explain how human beings buy clothes to, say, an audience of aliens, you would sound fairly ridiculous. Designers turn flat fabric into 3D body coverings in a limited number of sizes and even more limited number of shapes, and then we purchase what we can, hoping for the best, becoming angry at our bodies for not corresponding to the coverings instead of the other way around.
Buying clothes online has only complicated matters: The fraught process of finding an appropriate and comfortable fit isnâ€™t exactly easier when itâ€™s undertaken as an information-deprived guessing game while drinking wine at home. Failing to solve the problem of fit isnâ€™t an option. Returned products eat into companiesâ€™ bottom lines as unwearable clothes contribute to environmental waste.
The idea is that some entity would step in and create The One True Size Chart, solving all confusion around buying clothes forever
It seems like these problems should be quite solvable, and yet they persist. A theoretically logical solution to the confusion around clothing sizes has been proposed many times over: standard, universal sizes that donâ€™t vary between brands. The idea is that some entity would step in and create The One True Size Chart, and brands would label their clothes with the accepted official sizes, solving all confusion around buying clothes forever. Itâ€™s never going to work in the US â€” and for very good reasons.
Size universality is an alluring idea that appeals to our need for order, but order is a false god that would actually make it harder to buy clothes by limiting the shapes and dimensions available for our diverse bodies. Instead, we need something to help us navigate the existing size variation. That helper is new tech about to transform how we shop for clothes online. Recommendation widgets that guide us to the right sizes, apps that use a cellphone to measure the body, and brands offering affordable garment customization are about to make it easier to buy clothes that fit without ever visiting a dressing room.
What if sizing variation between brands is actually chaotic good?
While clothing sizes for menâ€™s bodies grew out of the Napoleonic wars and the need to clothe soldiers, it was the approach of WWII that necessitated a grand codification of the bodies of women, who wore uniforms while working in factories to make war supplies. In 1941, Ruth Oâ€™Brien and William Shelton published Womenâ€™s measurements for garment and pattern construction, a report based on their Work Projects Administration study. The project recorded the weight and 58 measurements of primarily middle-class, young, white women.
â€œThe 1941 study was the basis of all womenâ€™s clothing sizesâ€ in the postwar era, says Lynn Boorady, department head and professor at Oklahoma State University. It â€œhad additional studiesâ€ added â€œover the years and the data was massaged but it never strayed far from the standard â€˜hourglassâ€™ shape.â€ Despite the fact that just 8 percent of women in the US have true hourglass shapes â€” and that women of color need clothes â€” postwar mainstream clothing was dominated by a silhouette made for young white women wearing girdles. In the last two decades, new sizing standards put out by ASTM International and Size USA updated measurements and shapes. â€œWe saw the new sizing for â€˜curvyâ€™ or â€˜straightâ€™ figures right after the Size USA data was availableâ€ in 2003, says Boorady.
We now have better and more diverse data about what bodies in the US are like, but that doesnâ€™t mean that the next step should be a universal size chart that creates standard sizes used by every brand.
If we impose a universal size chart, â€œa lot of people are going to go without clothesâ€
If we impose a universal size chart, â€œa lot of people are going to go without clothes,â€ says Kathleen Fasanella, an apparel industry pattern maker with 40 years of experience in the industry. The reason comes down to anthropometric variation. Anthropometry is the study of the measurements and proportions of the human body. Sometimes itâ€™s used for racist pseudoscience (example: phrenology) and sometimes itâ€™s used to understand the range of foot sizes in a given country. The US has a lot of body dimension and shape variation because we have a lot of genetic variation. A universal size chart in the US would be a disaster â€” and it would likely center on the dimensions and shapes of white bodies, as the 1941 Oâ€™Brien and Shelton study did. â€œWeâ€™re not going to be able to standardize sizes until peopleâ€™s bodies are standard, and theyâ€™re not,â€ says Fasanella. â€œSizes are a social construct. Whatâ€™s a size 10? Nobody can agree.â€
Brands donâ€™t want universal size charts. Think of a brandâ€™s clothing shape, the dimensions of each size, and the amount of ease in their clothes as a form of intellectual property; itâ€™s the secret recipe that makes each brand special and keeps customers coming back. In fact, brands take their sizing and fit so seriously that they create clothes that fit their customers, veering away from published size standards as they gain more data. â€œSize charts are the beginning of the process; design and fit must also be taken into account,â€ says Boorady. According to Fasanella, â€œEverybody sizes to their market, to their customer base.â€ Even if every brand were working with the same size chart, that doesnâ€™t mean they would produce clothing of uniform dimensions.
This tailoring of the brand size chart and fit to their customersâ€™ bodies and preferences has been called â€œvanity sizing,â€ often represented as a craven and confusing practice that preys on womensâ€™ desire to be either smaller or larger depending on the garment type. In reality, brands are re-centering and adjusting their clothing dimensions so they can make clothes for their customers. The dimensions of sizes may have gotten bigger over time for some brands, but a whole lot of that is related to wonderful things such as the fact that weâ€™re not usually wearing girdles and clothes are being made to fit the bodies of women over 30.
Why shopping online for clothes is so damn hard
If youâ€™re uncertain about your size in a particular brand and cannot try things on in a retail store, the logical thing to do is hunt down the brandâ€™s size chart on their website. For US womenâ€™s brands, the size chart usually lists the bust, waist, and hip measurements in inches for each size sold. Itâ€™s a great resource, if often ferreted away and hard to access on mobile.

Hereâ€™s the problem: When I surveyed my Instagram followers, a highly unscientific sample of over 1,000 respondents indicated that only 75 percent own a measuring tape meant for bodies (as opposed to a more rigid metal measuring tape meant to aid home improvement projects). If we do happen to have a measuring tape at home, one study indicates that weâ€™re not always great at knowing how to use it to take clothing measurements: On average, errors ranged from -4.54 cm (1.79 in) to +6.15 cm (2.42 in). With an error rate like that, a measured customer could easily buy clothes at least one size off.
When you do manage to take decent measurements, then thereâ€™s the harrowing decision of how to wedge your body into a size chart that might not line up with your shape. If the measurements and size line up, that doesnâ€™t mean that the suggested size will align with how you see yourself; many people identify with a particular clothing size and a change can be jarring. Finally, even if your perfectly measured body matches very neatly with an accepted size, your fit preference might necessitate a different size altogether.
Fashionâ€™s surprisingly awesome sizing anarchy requires a matchmaker operating between brands and customers. Thatâ€™s where tech currently delivers for fashion e-commerce.
Fit prediction: a guide through sizing confusion
At this moment, on certain online shopping sites, you can type in some data about yourself and get a personal size prediction for that brand. Brands hire firms such as Fit Analytics and True Fit to advise their e-commerce customers on the size they should buy (neither responded to requests for comment for this story). Online-only and plus-size retailers such as ASOS, Lane Bryant, and City Chic have invested in customer-facing size adviser widgets, but so have brands with strong brick-and-mortar footprints such as Macyâ€™s and Kohlâ€™s.
Upon clicking either companyâ€™s sizing helper link on a product page, a window pops up and asks about things like the customerâ€™s height, weight, age, hip and midsection shapes, bra size, preferred garment fit, and favorite size in competing brands. Not all questions are required, but answering more questions improves the quality of the prediction. Depending on the company, one or multiple size options might be recommended.
â€œJ.C. Penney tried doing this about 12â€“15 years ago with pants; they would ask questions about bra size and it completely confused peopleâ€
Learning your size without taking off your clothes might sound like a totally new invention, but the concept actually has long roots. Oâ€™Brien and Shelton, authors of the 1941 sizing study, determined that height and weight were actually good at predicting oneâ€™s body dimensions. The problem was that people didnâ€™t want to walk into a store and disclose their weight â€” and they may not have even known their current weight since home scales were less common. More recently, attempts to predict size have failed because customers didnâ€™t understand why certain data was collected. â€œJ.C. Penney tried doing this about 12â€“15 years ago with pants; they would ask questions about bra size and it completely confused people. But it can be a valid question,â€ says Boorady, since â€œif you have a fuller bust, you are likely to have a fuller hip.â€
Fit prediction technology has some challenges. The links to fit widgets tend to be so unobtrusive on a desktop browser that some customers donâ€™t even realize theyâ€™re available. Many brands cut the link to size prediction for their mobile sites or insert it inconsistently even on desktop sites. Since size prediction hasnâ€™t been discussed much in the popular press, customers may wonder why they need to share information such as their age with a company trying to sell them pants (answer: age impacts how weight is distributed) or have concerns about how their data might be used. For customers who have deliberately stepped away from using a scale, prediction based on height and weight isnâ€™t going to work.
Despite the current limitations, fit prediction widgets are the fashion tech thatâ€™s already more or less working for e-commerce. At this point, the main hurdle for fit prediction seems to be a lack of public awareness, since most attention has gone to high-profile projects with far shakier track records.
Can body measurement projects and mass customization deliver a perfect fit?
The most visible fashion/tech collaborations to date have produced uneven results ranging from brand-specific measurement projects to avatars that creep us out to customization that doesnâ€™t always fit us. At some point soon, these technologies will combine into a truly useful system for buying clothes that fit us in every sense.
Japanâ€™s Zozo launched an ambitious custom clothing project in 72 countries starting in 2017. The Zozosuit, named one of Timeâ€™s best inventions of 2018, was a social media hit, utilizing fairly cute spotted stretchy body tights that worked with a branded app and cellphone camera to capture lots of measurements without a measuring tape. The capturing process took some troubleshooting, but the measurements themselves were shockingly good: The Zozosuit even managed to measure inseam and torso length without the need for a helper. The problem came when doing more with those measurements other than wondering how you came to be so asymmetrical; customers said that the â€œcustomâ€ Zozo clothing didnâ€™t fit and took forever to ship. Profits for the brand fell when sending free fit suits didnâ€™t translate into sales, and Zozo pulled out of the US and Europe in April 2019.

Excitement around 3D renderings of clothes on customersâ€™ avatars similarly collapsed in recent years. Fashion media and academics predicted that Clueless-style avatars would help sell customers on style and fit when shopping online. Alessandra Vecchi, senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion and principal investigator for the e-Size project, says that her team found that using an online shopping avatar or a rendering of the customerâ€™s own body would frequently discourage purchases and that an avatar â€œoften acts as a turnoff to the user.â€
More promising is mass customization. Brands like Indochino and eShakti offer â€œcustomâ€ or â€œbespokeâ€ clothing that allows for the garment to be made for each individual based on their measurements, with room for style changes such as longer sleeves or a wider neckline. â€œThis is not someone drafting a garment for each individual, itâ€™s selecting pre-made [pattern] pieces based on the measurement to customize [the garment],â€ says Fasanella, which helps to explain why such clothes are often priced only a bit higher than ready-made garments.
Uneven reviews of eShakti and Indochino suggest that the pattern database technology has promise but hasnâ€™t always been successful in delivering clothes that fit well. As customization technology improves and measuring technology along the lines of the Zozosuit emerges to help customers capture accurate measurements, experts predict that mass customization will help reduce waste and returns while boosting customer satisfaction and profits. For now, ordering made-to-measure clothes online requires a leap of faith.
Despite technologyâ€™s current solutions to the fit problem flopping or offering modest improvements on the status quo, the fashion industry is betting on tech solving the problem in the future. Amazon Body Labs is currently offering $25 gift cards to customers who consent to be scanned at their NYC project office. A workshop in Copenhagen last month dove deep into how fashion recommender systems that draw on everything from preferred fit to personal style can be refined and expanded.
Vecchi says, â€œI think [fit recommendation systems] will become the next big thingâ€ together with â€œactual measures with the aid of your mobileâ€ and algorithms that â€œtake into account other â€˜softer variablesâ€™ like fit, any possible preference for the degree of softness of the garment fabric to the touch, smell of the fabric, and so on.â€ The solutions to fashion consumersâ€™ fit problems are slowly coming together and thereâ€™s reason to hope that theyâ€™ll link up soon to create brand and size matchmakers that will actually help us find clothes that fit â€” even if weâ€™re shopping while drinking wine.

"The airstrikes started at 4 pm local time last Wednesday in northeastern Syria, across the border from Turkey. Black smoke plumed into the air over towns like Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad. Below, tens of thousands of people fled. Turkey had launched a ground offensive before the end of the day.
This is how Turkeyâ€™s Operation Peace Spring unfolded, just days after President Donald Trump relocated US troops from those border towns, offering Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan an open pathway to invade northeastern Syria, territory controlled by the Syrian Kurds.
Those same Syrian Kurds were Americaâ€™s most critical ally in fighting ISIS in Syria and ending its territorial caliphate. Kurdish militias fought as part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which lost about 11,000 fighters waging war against the terror group, a defeat for which the US president often takes credit.

The US partnership with the Kurds in Syria began during the Obama administration but intensified under Trump, who armed the fighters. But that alliance was born of necessity and desperation; it existed because of a common enemy in ISIS. And that uneasy relationship created a rift between the US and Turkey, a key NATO ally, which sees the Kurds as an existential threat.
Experts have long called the US-Kurdish partnership a â€œticking time bomb.â€ That bomb finally went off, quickly and decisively, after President Donald Trump spoke on the phone with ErdoÄŸan last Sunday. Shortly after, Trump ordered the withdrawal of the 50 or so American troops still in northeastern Syria, clearing the way for a Turkish invasion and leaving Kurdish forces and thousands of civilians at risk.
Turkeyâ€™s offensive may have felt like a dramatic escalation but it had been long-planned, and in many ways, entirely predictable. The situation is complex, with broad and still-unpredictable consequences for Syria.
This story is developing rapidly, but hereâ€™s a guide to help you understand what is happening, why itâ€™s happening, and what might come next.
1) Who are the Kurds?
The Kurds are an ethnic group whose population is primarily spread across Iran, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Armenia. Theyâ€™re considered one of the worldâ€™s largest stateless nations. The total population of Kurds in the Middle East and in the broader diaspora varies, but most estimates put it somewhere between 25 million and 40 million. The Syrian Kurdish population is among the smallest, roughly around 1.7 million people concentrated in northern Syria. Most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, although not exclusively, and Kurds, depending on the region, are also Shiite Muslims, Christians, and other sects.
The Kurds ended up where they are â€” without a homeland â€” because of the Western powers who drew the regionâ€™s map after World War I and the breakup of the Ottoman Empire. The Allied powers (the UK, France, Italy, Japan, and others) who won the war signed the 1920 Treaty of SÃ¨vres with what was left of the Ottoman Empire. That pact set aside territory for the Kurds as it carved up the Ottoman Empire. But that got amended with the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, which established the modern Turkish state and the other borders in the Middle East. That treaty omitted a Kurdish nation-state and left the population divided across several different countries.

That left the Kurds as ethnic minorities in other states, where theyâ€™ve often faced repression and violence.
In Syria specifically, the Kurds faced severe discrimination and were denied basic rights and citizenship. This escalated under the Baâ€™athist regime of Hafez al-Assad (father of Bashar, Syriaâ€™s current leader), who led Syria from the 1970s to 2000, and continued under the current president, Bashar al-Assad.
In the 1970s, the Hafez al-Assad government resettled Syrian Arabs in Kurdish towns in the north, displacing Kurds and establishing an â€œArab Belt.â€ Meanwhile, Assad supported Kurdish resistance outside of Syria, specifically the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party (PKK) in Turkey in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly to mess with Syriaâ€™s regional rivals. The now-imprisoned leader of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, was based in Syria until the late 1990s and launched attacks from there.
For decades, the PKK waged a violent insurgency inside Turkey, fighting to establish their own independent Kurdish state. The Turkish government fought back in a bloody counteroffensive, and the resulting fighting left tens of thousands dead.
There were some notable instances of Kurdish resistance to the Syrian regime: In 2004, for instance, a soccer brawl between Syrian Arabs and Kurds in the northeastern city of Qamishli transformed and spread into a Kurdish uprising against the regime. Syrian government forces crushed that movement fairly quickly, though pockets of resistance continued â€” and might have been a precursor of what was to come in Syria.
Still, Syrian Kurds werenâ€™t united politically; there were multiple parties and movements. That started to change after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, which saw the rise and eventual dominance of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD.
The PYD, founded in 2003, is an offshoot of the PKK â€” the insurgent group in neighboring Turkey thatâ€™s waged war against the Turkish government since the 1980s.
Those ties between the PKK and the PYD are why Turkey sees the Syrian Kurds as such a threat. And Turkey isnâ€™t exactly wrong to see it that way: The PYD became so successful in Syria in large part because of its relationship with the more established PKK. The PYDâ€™s fierce military arm, known as the Peopleâ€™s Protection Units (YPG), benefited from PKKâ€™s decades of fighting Turkey. (Thereâ€™s also the YPJ, which is the womenâ€™s militia.)
The Syrian civil war ultimately enabled the PYDâ€™s rise to power. Assad was dealing with major opposition in big cities in Syria, and his attempts to put down the uprising strained his armed forces. So, in the summer of 2012, Assad pulled out of the traditionally Kurdish areas so he could deal with rebellions elsewhere. This gave little incentive to the Kurdish militias to join in the fight against the Assad government. It also created a vacuum for the PYD to begin establishing control.
The Kurds named the self-governing territory in northeastern Syria that emerged â€œRojava.â€ Kurds arenâ€™t the only ethnic group in this area, but the PYD promised to protect minorities and promote a secular, democratic, and egalitarian society. It established the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in October 2015, which is led by Kurdish fighters in the YPG/YPJ, but its ranks include many Syrian Arabs, along with Christians and other groups.
But as this Kurdish experiment in self-governance began, the Syrian Kurds were faced with another looming threat: ISIS. But before we get to the terror group, letâ€™s talk about Turkey.
2) Why does Turkey care so much about what the Kurds in Syria are doing?
It really has to do with the Syrian Kurdsâ€™ connection to the PKK, which the US, EU, and others have classified a terror group.
The Turks got their modern state after World War II but the Kurds did not, and they were denied rights within Turkey pretty much since its founding.
The PKK formed in the 1970s, embracing both Kurdish nationalism and a socialist ideology with the goal of establishing an independent Kurdish state. The PKK waged an armed war against the Turkish state since 1984, a conflict thatâ€™s killed about 40,000 people.
The PKK has undeniable links to the Syrian PYD, but from the Turkish perspective, the establishment of a Kurdish-run, autonomous territory on the border between Syria and Turkey is far bigger than a security risk â€” itâ€™s an existential threat. ErdoÄŸan does not want to see any form of Kurdish self-rule across the border, and heâ€™s using the fight against terrorism as the guise to invade and shut it down.
3) Why did the US partner with the Kurds to fight ISIS?
In 2014, ISIS began rapidly consolidating territory in Syria and Iraq. Their advance brought them to a Kurdish city on the Syrian-Turkish border called Kobane.
ISIS wanted control of the city for strategic and symbolic reasons. ISIS launched their siege in September 2014, which turned into a four-month attempt to seize the city and its adjacent villages from those Kurdish militias.
At the start, ISIS was better equipped, and the Kurdish militias in Kobane were essentially surrounded by ISIS. Thousands were displaced as ISIS threatened mass slaughter. And though ISIS was also at Turkeyâ€™s doorstep, the Kurdsâ€™ connection with the PKK kept Ankara on the sidelines. Turkey refused to help and were more or less okay with allowing ISIS to eliminate its Kurdish enemies.

But the United States did step in, beginning airstrikes against ISIS toward the end of September 2014. At first, the US-led coalitionâ€™s support did little to slow ISISâ€™s advance and Kobane still looked on the verge of falling under ISIS control.
But in mid-October 2014, ISISâ€™s fortunes began to shift as the US increased airstrikes and Kurdish militias led an offensive to retake some territory that ISIS had captured. The battle for the city continued for weeks; only in January 2015 did the Kurdish militias finally reclaim Kobane and push back ISIS.
The battle of Kobane was a major milestone in both the fight against ISIS and the Kurdsâ€™ mission to establish their own autonomous territory. It basically made the PYD the umbrella group for all Kurds, as its armed wing, the YPG, proved its ability to protect the population. It also made it hard for the US to ignore the Kurdsâ€™ effectiveness on the battlefield.
The Syrian Kurds were far from an ideal partner for the US, given the animus between them and Turkey, a NATO ally. Washington, too, has labeled the PKK a terrorist group since 1997, and the connection between the PKK and the YPG fighters is pretty undeniable.
But a few factors pushed the US into partnership with the Syrian Kurds despite all of that. The most obvious one, of course, is that the United States did not want to put its own troops on the ground in Syria to battle ISIS. So it was going to have to find another option.
The Free Syrian Army, which is backed by Turkey, was one possibility. These were the rebels battling Assad, who had also received CIA support since about 2013. (Trump ended funding in 2017.) But the Free Syrian Army was a pretty loose band of rebels and was much more focused on fighting the regime. Their ranks also contained plenty of extremist elements, and some fighters defected to groups like ISIS, too.
â€œThis is a group that the Turks put forward and offered to the United States when the United States went looking for allies in the fight against the Islamic State, and were rejected by the Pentagon on the grounds that they were poorly trained, poorly equipped, and riddled with extremists,â€ Steven Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told reporters on a call last week.
That basically left the Kurdish militia as the one reliable fighting force.
And, at the time â€” between late 2012 until the summer of 2015 â€” Turkey and the PKK were in the middle of peace talks and a ceasefire was in place. â€œFrom the American perspective, this was the ideal scenario,â€ GÃ¼neÅŸ Murat TezcÃ¼r, an expert on Kurdish politics and a professor at the University of Central Florida, told me. The peace talks gave the US some cover to make overtures to Kurdish fighters to fight the Islamic State while still working closely with its NATO ally in Turkey.
That peace process fell apart in 2015 and the ceasefire ended â€” leaving the US to balance this extraordinarily delicate position, appease Turkey, and try to mediate between both. The US tried to diminish the PKK-PYD connections, and encouraged the rebranding of the Kurdish forces â€œSyrian Democratic Forcesâ€ to account for its relationship with Syrian Arab fighters.
â€œAnd it was working until just last Sunday,â€ TezcÃ¼r said.
But this partnership was never really sustainable. Both the Obama and Trump administrations partnered with the Syrian Kurds to achieve a very narrow goal: defeating ISIS.
That narrow focus on what the SDF could do for the US ignored the larger political dynamics at stake â€” the â€œticking time bomb,â€ so to speak.
4) What did the Kurds and the SDF do to defeat ISIS?
The Obama administration provided training and air support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, which encouraged the SDF to take on ISIS in northern Syria.
The Obama administration wanted to use the Syrian Kurds to defeat ISIS, with limited engagement from US troops. The Trump administration wanted the same, but in 2017, Trump made the decision to arm the Syrian Kurds, alarming Turkey even more.
The US saw arming the Kurds as one of the only ways to successfully root out ISIS from Raqqa, the caliphateâ€™s de facto capital in Syria. The SDF began moving toward Raqqa in November 2016 and launched its offensive in June 2017. After months of fighting â€” backed by US airstrikes â€” the SDF retook Raqqa in October.
The reclamation of Raqqa in Syria, along with the fall of Mosul in Iraq in 2017, helped crush ISISâ€™s territorial caliphate. After defeating ISIS in Raqqa, the SDF advanced south to Deir al-Zour, where the SDF chipped away at ISIS territory, finally taking the very last ISIS holdout in March 2019. All told, the SDF lost about 11,000 fighters in its efforts to defeat ISIS.
As the SDF reclaimed this territory from ISIS, it set up governing councils to administer and rebuild cities, and it also took on the responsibility of guarding the thousands of ISIS prisoners and their families, including at the al-Hol refugee camp that holds about 70,000 ISIS women and children.
5) Why is Turkey attacking Syria now?
As the SDF expanded its territory and control, Turkish President ErdoÄŸan became increasingly anxious about the Syrian Kurds and their de facto state across the border.
Turkey didnâ€™t want the Kurds to have their own independent state right on its border, fearing it would give that much more momentum to the Kurdish insurgency in its own country. â€œThey are afraid that this entity that exists on the Turkish border could get some official status,â€ Wladimir van Wilgenburg, journalist and author of The Kurds of Northern Syria: Governance, Diversity and Conflicts, told Vox.
ErdoÄŸan thus wanted to push the Syrian Kurds back from the border and establish a buffer zone between them and his country. He made a similar move in northwestern Syria in Afrin, in 2018.
But ErdoÄŸan wants to expand that buffer zone and use some of this territory resettle some 2 million of the 3.6 Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey since the start of the Syrian War.
ErdoÄŸan explained his plan at the United Nations General Assembly in September, going so far as to suggest a safe zone as far as 50 miles into Syria, stretching to Raqqa.
ErdoÄŸan is under increasing pressure at home because of Turkeyâ€™s flagging economy. ErdoÄŸan presided over a strong economy in the previous decade, when the Turkish president pursued growth at all costs; this involved plentiful borrowing and spending, including on infrastructure and massive construction projects. Now Turkey is faced with a lot of debt, which has spooked investors and fueled an economic tailspin.
Against that backdrop, ErdoÄŸanâ€™s political party lost key mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara. Heâ€™s also drawing backlash from the number of refugees in Syria; as the economy has struggled, Turks are beginning to cast them as scapegoats for high unemployment and the fallout from the economic crisis. So clearing out the Kurds, resettling refugees, and launching a military would ostensibly give ErdoÄŸan a much-needed boost at home.
But what largely stopped Turkey from actually moving forward was the United States and the small number of troops still stationed in northeastern Syria. In December 2018, Trump abruptly announced that he was pulling troops out of Syria, which looked likely to pave the way for Turkey to come in and establish this safe zone. Trump would go on to reverse his decision somewhat â€” but it was clear he wanted to get out, and ErdoÄŸan desperately wanted to move in.
In August, the United States and Turkey signed a joint security mechanism, which was intended to address some of Turkeyâ€™s security concerns about the Kurds by establishing a buffer zone incrementally. Starting in September, the US and Turkey began running joint patrols, and the US helped push back some Syrian Kurdish forces from the Turkish border. The US also convinced the Kurds to cooperate with the effort and destroy some of their fortifications â€” ultimately making them more vulnerable in case of a Turkish incursion.
â€œIn August, we came to this â€˜security mechanismâ€™ agreement,â€ Azad Cudi, a British Iranian Kurd who is a sniper for the YPG, told the BBC. â€œBased on that, we withdrew. We destroyed the fighting positions which were built to fight the Turkish in case of an invasion and we handed them over to the Americans.â€
But Turkey apparently was losing patience. After ErdoÄŸanâ€™s phone call with the White House last Sunday, Trump agreed to relocate the 50 or so troops still stationed in Kurdish-held towns near the border. Though the White House scrambled to defend Trumpâ€™s move, saying the administration did not endorse or support Turkeyâ€™s invasion, it was really too late. Once US troops cleared out, ErdoÄŸan had an open pathway into Kurdish territory.
And so â€œOperation Peace Springâ€ began.
6) How are the Kurds responding?
The Kurds called the Trump administrationâ€™s decision to withdraw a â€œstab in the backâ€ but said theyâ€™d try to hold off Turkish advances. Even so, in the initial aftermath of the Turkish offensive, the Kurds call on the US-led coalition to institute a no-fly zone to prevent civilian casualties. Their pleas were unanswered.
The Kurds are fighting back, particularly in the border towns, where theyâ€™re also taking on the Turkish-backed Syrian militias, loosely known as the Free Syrian Army.
But the Kurds, effectively abandoned by the US, needed more support. So they struck a deal with Assad to deploy Syrian regime troops near the border to deter Turkeyâ€™s incursion and try to protect Kurdish civilians.
â€œAn agreement has been reached with the Syrian government â€” whose duty it is to protect the countryâ€™s borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty â€” for the Syrian Army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the SDF stop this aggressionâ€ by Turkey, the SDF said.
This puts the USâ€™s one-time ally in Syria on the side of Assad, Russia, and Iran. It also sets up a confrontation between Turkey â€” remember, a NATO ally â€” and the Syrian regime. But most critically, as Assad moves into the north, it could potentially return a big chunk of Syria into his control. The Kurds said that the Syrian regime forces wouldnâ€™t be posted in areas where the Kurds are fighting the Turks; the Kurds also said they would continue to administer the parts of northern Syria under their control. But how long that will last now that Assadâ€™s forces have moved into the region is the looming question about this arrangement.
Meanwhile, Russia is entering the territory the US left, trying to keep both Turkey (with whom Russia has had a warmer relationship of late) and Assadâ€™s forces separate.
7) What does this mean for ISIS?
The SDF is guarding approximately 11,000 detained ISIS terrorists, including about 2,000 foreign fighters. That does not include the nearly 70,000 people living in the al-Hol refugee camp in northeastern Syria, which contains ISIS families and where the Pentagon says ISIS is actively recruiting new members.
The Department of Defense has previously warned that the SDF has limited capacity to guard these ISIS fighters indefinitely. US officials have also sounded the alarm that ISIS is planning mass prison breaks; a Turkish invasion and the chaos itâ€™s bringing might give ISIS fighters the cover and ability to do so.
The White House has said that Turkey will be responsible for all ISIS fighters captured in the territory in the past two years, but though ErdoÄŸan is happy to claim heâ€™s fighting ISIS, his focus is most certainly the Kurds. And itâ€™s not clear Turkey itself has the capacity â€” or desire â€” to take on this responsibility of guarding ISIS fighters or how such a transfer would even work, as the SDF and Turkey are essentially battling each other.

ISIS no longer controls a lot of territory, but itâ€™s morphed into an insurgency movement and remains a serious threat to the stability of both Iraq and Syria. The Department of Defense warned in August that a US drawdown of troops risked an ISIS resurgence.
In other words, all the worst-case scenarios are playing out right now, and ISIS could very well take advantage of this chaos and instability to begin to reconstitute. As Daniel Byman wrote for Vox, â€œEven a small number of hardened, dedicated fighters could pose a major terrorism threat; research has proven they are far more lethal.
â€œThe Islamic State is highly opportunistic,â€ he continued, â€œand it will use the ensuing chaos and distraction of its enemies to reconstitute itself, increasing the danger of international terrorism as well as local violence.â€
There are signs this is already happening: ISIS detainees and sympathizers escaped from a camp in Ayn Issa in northeastern Syria on Sunday. There are reports of ISIS sympathizers rioting and attacking guards in detention camps. And the US failed to extract dozens of high-value ISIS detainees from Kurdish prisoners before Turkey rolled through, according to the New York Times.
8) How has the US responded?
The United Statesâ€™ response has been, to put it mildly, totally wild.
Trump relocated troops from northeastern Syria, which ultimately gave Turkey the go-ahead to invade.
But even as he did so, Trump vowed that he would â€œtotally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkeyâ€ if the country did anything he considered off-limits.
Then Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced Sunday the US was withdrawing all 1,000 troops from northeastern Syria, basically opening a void and giving Turkey more cover to go deeper into Syria.

On Monday, Trump issued a stinging statement against Turkey, raising steel tariffs on Turkey 50 percent and suspending trade talks. He also issued an executive order putting sanctions on Turkey, including Turkish government officials and ministries. He dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien to Turkey to try to negotiate a ceasefire.
Congress is also considering bipartisan sanctions legislation against Turkey that goes further than Trumpâ€™s measure, and are considering a proposal that would ban weapons sales to Turkey (the EU halted arms sales, too). On Wednesday, the House overwhelmingly passed, 354-60, a resolution condemning Trumpâ€™s decision to remove forces from Syria. Itâ€™s a strong bipartisan statement from Congress â€” but wonâ€™t change much on the ground.
Ultimately, thatâ€™s the problem with all of these measures, including the latest pressure on Turkey. Itâ€™s all coming a little past due, right after the US ceded whatever influence and leverage it had in Syria. Turkey is already in Syria, the consequences of which canâ€™t be reversed.
9) What does this mean for the war in Syria?
Itâ€™s far too soon to say. But in a week, the map in Syria has shifted dramatically. The Kurds still hold on to territory, but the future of their democratic experiment looks bleak. Their alliance of necessity with Assad is likely to bring many parts of northern Syria back under the regimeâ€™s control. This is the very territory the US and Kurds worked to liberate from ISIS and now it will be handed to Assad, giving him greater influence â€” if not yet total control â€” over the territory and the ISIS fighters being held there.
Turkeyâ€™s incursion continues, and ErdoÄŸan seems unencumbered by previous commitments and looks willing to push into Syria to establish a buffer zone.

The new fighting is likely to displace tens of thousands of people, who are fleeing to the south to escape the bombing and shelling. About 6 million refugees have fled Syria and millions more are displaced within it; Turkeyâ€™s offensive will only exacerbate this.
What does seem certain is that Trumpâ€™s decision has effectively taken the United States â€” and its coalition partners â€” out of any discussion about the future of Syria. Any peace or ceasefire will almost certainly be guided by the players there: the regime, Russia, Turkey.
â€œThe US will be without any role,â€ van Wilgenburg said. Trump, whoâ€™s made a promise to disentangle America from conflicts overseas, maybe doesnâ€™t care. But the fallout says a lot about American influence and just how much it has diminished.

"TV and the internet were made for each other.
Thereâ€™s a reason the rise of so-called prestige drama parallels the growth of the internet. Getting online after each episode to talk about it with your friends, or to read recaps from your favorite critics, only really became possible once the internet entered our homes.
The internet made the office water cooler global for just about any TV show. I can tweet about some obscure program and there will inevitably be somebody who wants to talk about it, something I have proved time and again with my beloved Borgen, a Danish political drama few Americans have seen but many people on Twitter would love to discuss.
But the internet unfortunately also popularized the idea that TV shows exist to be solved. This sad trend was perhaps inevitable. The first major show to really see internet discussion take off was 1993â€™s The X-Files, a series built around an ongoing alien mystery, and the biggest boom in online TV discussion directly parallels the 2004-2010 run of Lost, perhaps the definitive mystery show. Trying to solve a show became a popular pastime for a very good reason, and the decentralized nature of the internet â€” where puzzle-solving can be crowdsourced â€” made it an ideal platform for this form of consumption.

How The X-Files invented modern television
The idea that your favorite show is keeping something from you, that you need to figure out its secrets, is now applied to basically every show on television. And not without reason! Shows like Mr. Robot and Game of Thrones withhold key information from the audience to enhance their surprising plot turns; even Breaking Bad uncharacteristically kept the audience in the dark to preserve one of its most shocking twists (the identity of a certain poisoner).
Not every TV show is built in such a twisty fashion, but online discussion too often fails to acknowledge as much. Think back to how many weirdo Mad Men theories popped up as that show approached its ending, or consider how often viewers tried to outguess something as relatively straightforward as The Americans.
I donâ€™t want to call these theories â€œwrong.â€ Theyâ€™re often a fun way to engage with a TV show, and on that level, Iâ€™m glad they exist. But they often also badly misunderstand TV shows in ways that undercut the showsâ€™ central themes.
And that is exactly whatâ€™s happening with the season two finale of Succession.
The season 2 finale of Succession presents a straightforward series of events. Or does it???
Kendall prepares to drop a huge bomb. HBO
The current fan theorizing about Succession largely concerns the final five minutes of its season two finale, â€œThis Is Not for Tears.â€
To explain what happens there, Iâ€™m going to have to spoil everything.
The action of the finale involves nearly all the members of the Roy family and most of the executives directly involved in the innermost dealings of Waystar-Royco, the media conglomerate at the seriesâ€™ center. Theyâ€™re attempting to figure out who among them should be fired from the company to prove that it means business about cleaning up its act after a massive coverup scandal concerning serious crimes aboard the companyâ€™s cruise ships.
By episodeâ€™s end, it has been decided that middle son Kendall (Jeremy Strong), the closest thing Succession has to a core protagonist and the saddest boy alive, will take the blame and leave Waystar-Royco. Kendallâ€™s dad, Logan (Brian Cox), assures him that heâ€™ll be taken care of. Kendall asks if the old man could ever have imagined his son in the CEO chair, and Logan says no â€” Kendall just isnâ€™t the killer he would need to be for the job.
Later, while en route to the press conference where Kendall will take the fall for Waystar-Roycoâ€™s sins, Kendall and his cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun), an extremely tall bundle of nervous comic energy, have a veiled discussion about how bad Greg feels for what Kendall has to do. And if you remember that during Successionâ€™s season one finale, Greg told Kendall that heâ€™d stolen some documents pertaining to the cruise ship scandal, documents heâ€™d been asked to destroy that could blow the company wide open, then you might see whatâ€™s coming next. But probably, like me, you forgot. (This little detail will be important!)

8 winners and 6 losers from a Succession finale that blows up the whole show
Kendall shows up at the press conference. He starts to explain that he is to blame for the coverup. But then he quickly pivots: Logan is the one at fault, and Kendall has documents that prove it. (Cut to Greg holding the folder that contains said documents, which has been haunting the proceedings all season long.) As the room erupts with questions from reporters, Kendall rips up the prepared statement that Waystar had wanted him to read and strides offstage like a boss. His other family members, who are hanging out with their dad, react in open-mouthed shock to what theyâ€™ve just seen on TV. The company is now in serious trouble.
The final shot of the episode cuts in close on Logan, watching the chaos caused by Kendallâ€™s announcement. His lips curl into the slightest of smiles. And if youâ€™re me, you read this scene as Logan realizing his son is a killer after all and respecting the kidâ€™s game at least a little bit, while surely resolving to destroy his No. 1 boy.
But if youâ€™re a lot of other people, you might have interpreted Loganâ€™s subtle grin as a reveal that he was in on the plan all along.
The â€œLogan was in on itâ€ theory has some validity to it, but itâ€™s also based in a fundamental misunderstanding of how Succession tells stories
Does Logan tell Kendall that itâ€™s one big scheme? Eh, probably not. HBO
Thereâ€™s one big and obvious argument for why Logan might have directed Kendall to take him down: The first half of the finale is largely informed by a phone call Logan receives from important shareholders who want him to step down in the wake of the scandal. But when he presents this option to his family at the all-important meeting where they snipe over who should get fired, his children immediately reject the idea, with Kendall objecting the most strenuously. (To be sure, many of them donâ€™t seem that upset by the thought of Logan stepping down and are likely protesting because they think theyâ€™re supposed to.)
Is it possible that Logan then schemed with Kendall to present the old man as so toxic he had to leave the company, distancing Waystar-Royco from its founder but allowing it to stay in the hands of a Roy family member (namely Kendall)? Sure.
But is it probable? Iâ€™m not convinced.
Most of the argument that Logan had a hand in what transpired rests on Loganâ€™s final smile, which is admittedly ambiguous. But this argument also ignores a ton of other things that happen in the episode. For instance, if Succession ultimately reveals a secret scheme between Logan and Kendall, it will lessen the emotional impact of Shiv (Sarah Snook) â€” Loganâ€™s only daughter, who has been at the heart of much of the season â€” deciding to prioritize her husbandâ€™s survival at the company over that of her brother, Kendall.
Similarly, a secret scheme would mean that the scene where Logan breaks the news to Kendall that Kendall will be Waystar-Roycoâ€™s blood sacrifice fundamentally makes no sense and exists only to mislead the audience.
And while I wouldnâ€™t call this evidence of a twist, per se, if you donâ€™t remember the scene from season one where Greg tells Kendall about the documents, his involvement in Kendallâ€™s turn against his father feels like part of a massive twist â€” because Succession deliberately didnâ€™t show you the scene where Greg and Kendall start scheming. The Greg â€œtwistâ€ then makes it seem like there may be bigger shoes to drop, which primes you to look for story turns that may not exist (like, say, Logan being in on the scheme).
But thereâ€™s one huge piece of evidence against the idea that Logan planned Kendallâ€™s apparent betrayal: In general, Succession doesnâ€™t tell stories predicated on twists. Its focus isnâ€™t on plot but on character.
For an example of a show that really did attempt a twist that was hidden from viewers in plain sight, consider Game of Thrones. In that showâ€™s seventh season, sisters Arya and Sansa seem to be at odds, including in scenes where they are the only two characters present. But the season finale reveals that for at least some of that season they were actually hatching a plan to take out the duplicitous Littlefinger. The resolution of their feud is twisty enough, I suppose, but the buildup to it (especially the scenes where Arya and Sansa are arguing with each other to keep up a charade solely for the audience) fatally undercuts everything else the show is trying to do. The storyline becomes nonsensical.
Succession doesnâ€™t hide stuff from the audience. Its plotlines usually proceed along a fairly straightforward A-to-B emotional arc. And those arcs are usually self-contained: Each episode takes place at a time when most or all of the Roy family can be in the same physical space, and the story is usually closed off, with the conclusion of one leading into the start of the next.
For instance, in a sequence of late season two episodes, Shiv gets screwed over by a rival in one episode, plots her revenge in the next, and then sees that revenge come to fruition in the next. These three stories build off each other, but they are not straightforward continuations of a single emotional thread in the way they might have been on Game of Thrones.
Succession also doesnâ€™t keep secrets from its audience across episodes. In the season two premiere, Logan offers the CEO job to Shiv once he retires, saying itâ€™s time to start training her to take over. At the time, some viewers speculated that he had also offered the job to her brothers and we just hadnâ€™t seen those scenes, to make it more devastating for Shiv to eventually realize that her fatherâ€™s promise was a false one.
But as the season progressed and more characters learned about Loganâ€™s offer to Shiv, it became clear that he hadnâ€™t extended a similar offer to her brothers, who were upset that Logan had apparently favored their sister for the role. Succession had shown us exactly what we needed to see to understand the emotional ramifications of what would happen across the rest of the season, which rises and falls on Shivâ€™s chances at becoming the new Waystar-Royco CEO. (Indeed, almost its exact center is Logan refusing to name Shiv as his successor when presented with the opportunity.)
Itâ€™s a lot more common for Succession to raise a particular plot point â€” those cruise ship documents of Gregâ€™s, for example â€” and then to seemingly forget about it for a while, only to bring it back at the least opportune moment. This approach can make certain events feel like twists because they rely on maintaining a deep memory of the show. But theyâ€™re not actually twists. Succession is always careful to make sure you see every single step of each characterâ€™s emotional journey.
Thus, while itâ€™s not impossible for Logan and Kendall to have plotted something together that the audience still isnâ€™t privy to, if that turns out to be the case, it will be a fairly substantial break from how Succession has told stories up until this point. The show could make such a break. But itâ€™s not immediately obvious what Succession might gain from doing so, beyond a momentary distraction of its viewers for a one-off twist.
And anyway, thereâ€™s a much more dramatically interesting option in the scenario suggested by this ending at face value: All of the Roys and their associates having to choose between Logan and Kendall.
Many fans of Succession want Logan to be a mastermind. But the show undercuts this reading at every opportunity.
Kendall tunes out the world. HBO
At the core of the â€œLogan planned it!â€ theory is the idea that the man is a mastermind who sees eight or nine moves ahead and always has a master plan, with several alternative plans on deck should any or all fall through. Itâ€™s a reading steeped in two decades of drama antiheroes who behave in just such a manner â€” Breaking Badâ€™s Walter White was this sort of character â€” but it doesnâ€™t really make sense in the context of Successionâ€™s focus on Logan as an abusive asshole who is so disgustingly rich that he can essentially bully the world into letting him keep his power.

The rise of Succession, TVâ€™s new must-watch show
Throughout the seriesâ€™ two seasons, Logan has found himself wounded and isolated on multiple occasions, and he has always clawed back whatever he lost. But heâ€™s always done so by throwing money around and tormenting his children into doing what he wants, and pointedly not by being a great planner.
Consider season twoâ€™s midsection, in which Logan launches a seemingly doomed bid to gobble up a company called Pierce (a thinly veiled version of the New York Times). When his entreaties arenâ€™t met with warmth, he just keeps increasing his offer until the Pierce family takes interest. When the deal ultimately falls through, he blusters and rages but is unable to intimidate the Pierces into playing along because the family doesnâ€™t feel the need to appease him in the way his children do.
The immediate fallout of the dealâ€™s collapse is Logan flirting with and eventually offering the Waystar CEO job to former Pierce CEO Rhea (Holly Hunter) in a way that makes it clear how thoroughly sheâ€™s playing him. The implication is that Loganâ€™s self-regard often blinds him to how other people can twist him in knots. If you donâ€™t need his money and arenâ€™t scared of his anger, you have a lot of power over him.
Thatâ€™s exactly the place Kendall finds himself in at the end of season two. The rest of the season has been teaching viewers how to interpret Successionâ€™s characters so that Kendallâ€™s betrayal feels surprising in the moment but inevitable in retrospect, which is supremely satisfying to see. To reveal that Logan and Kendall were in cahoots wouldnâ€™t just rob that betrayal of some of its power; it would render whole portions of Succession retroactively meaningless in pursuit of a â€œLogan Roy is a mastermindâ€ reading that the show hasnâ€™t bothered to advance so far.
Succession isnâ€™t a show about how strong Logan Roy is. Itâ€™s a show about how weak he is and how he obscures his weakness via emotional and even physical abuse of his children. Itâ€™s a sad, difficult story to watch play out, and Kendallâ€™s break with his father is the first example of one of his children standing up to say that the way he treats them is unacceptable, transplanted to the world of high, Shakespearean drama.
To argue that Logan is a mastermind is understandable, not only because we tend to treat TV as a puzzle to be solved but because this is so often what we do with real-life figures who share Loganâ€™s temperament. This idea doesnâ€™t align with reality â€” nobody is that smart, because being that smart would amount to having psychic powers. But it thrives in prestige television, where antiheroes are routinely 17 steps ahead of everybody else.
Logan isnâ€™t 17 steps ahead of everybody else. Heâ€™s just good at making everybody do what he wants by treating them like people who exist only to do his bidding. And his children, who long desperately for his love, usually comply because they know no other way to live.
Iâ€™m aware that saying all of the above wonâ€™t stop people from trying to solve Succession. As long as people talk about TV on the internet, there will always be a contingent trying to guess what will happen next. And how else are we going to fill the long wait for Succession season three? That kind of guesswork can be a lot of fun!
But in the case of Succession in particular, it also risks missing what makes the show remarkable. To reduce its characters to a collection of plot twists waiting to happen is to confuse their psychological richness for contrivance. It doesnâ€™t deserve to be treated like just another sideshow in a world full of carnival barkers."
"To say President Donald Trump has a penchant for firing off some weird, disturbing, and even dangerous tweets is an understatement. But should he be kicked off Twitter entirely? Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) thinks so, and many others agree â€” but not everyone.
Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) clashed at Tuesdayâ€™s Democratic debate when the California senator tried to push her Massachusetts counterpart to call for the presidentâ€™s Twitter account to be suspended.
â€œHere we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down,â€ Harris said. She pointed to the manifesto released by the mass shooter at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart in August, which mirrored some of the presidentâ€™s rhetoric about immigrants.
â€œI donâ€™t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House, thatâ€™s our job,â€ Warren replied.
She tried to expand the conversation to a broader one about the power tech companies wield and her proposal to break up some of the major players, and she used the occasion to talk about her latest pledge not to take money from tech executives, which multiple candidates, including Harris, have made. But Harris kept at it, encouraging Warren to say itâ€™s time to oust the president from Twitter.
â€œIt seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook,â€ Harris said.
â€œLook, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I donâ€™t have a problem with that,â€ Warren replied.
Calls to suspend President Trumpâ€™s Twitter account arenâ€™t new. Multiple people and entities have made arguments for kicking the president off of the platform, saying that his tweets violate Twitterâ€™s terms of service or include racist and violence-inciting attacks. Harris has been prodding the San Francisco-based company to make the move for weeks, in light of the presidentâ€™s tweets regarding the Ukraine whistleblower and impeachment inquiry.
And beyond Harris, there have been questions about what Twitter should do about Trumpâ€™s communications on the platform since, essentially, the start of his presidency. On the one hand, he is the president of the United States, and his tweets are newsworthy. On the other hand, his tweets can be dangerous and could potentially incite violence.
Twitter and other tech companies are increasingly under scrutiny regarding many of their business practices, including content moderation. The issue is only likely to heat up moving forward, including as the 2020 election approaches.
But ultimately, Twitter gets to decide what speech it does and doesnâ€™t allow â€” itâ€™s a private company and doesnâ€™t owe anyone free speech rights. It also doesnâ€™t have to do what politicians or outside groups tell it.
Kamala Harrisâ€™s push to get Trump off Twitter, briefly explained
Harris started encouraging Twitter to oust Trump in late September, and sheâ€™s kept it up since then.
On October 1, she sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey saying that the president had engaged in activity that â€œappears to violate the terms of the user agreement that your company requires all users on the platformâ€ and encouraged him to take punitive action. She pointed to the presidentâ€™s tweets calling the Ukraine whistleblower a â€œleaker,â€ â€œspy,â€ or â€œpartisan operative,â€ and arguing he deserves to â€œmeet my accuser.â€ She also highlighted tweets attacking House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) and suggesting removing him from office would cause a civil war.
â€œI believe the Presidentâ€™s recent tweets rise to the level that Twitter should consider suspending his account. Others have had their accounts suspended for less offensive behavior,â€ Harris wrote. â€œAnd when this kind of abuse is being spewed from the most powerful office in the United States, the stakes are too high to do nothing.â€
Voxâ€™s Matt Yglesias wrote at the time that Trumpâ€™s Twitter tirades revealed a â€œdangerously unfit presidentâ€ on a â€œnonstop Twitter binge, lying about whatâ€™s going on in Congress, lying about what happened in Ukraine, and escalating his inappropriate conduct by threatening the country with a civil war and threatening his enemies in Congress with criminal charges.â€
But does that mean Trump should be kicked off Twitter? Not everyone agrees.
Well before Tuesdayâ€™s debate, a reporter asked Sen. Warren whether Trump should be banned from Twitter. She chuckled and responded, â€œNo.â€
Harris confronted Warren over the matter at Tuesdayâ€™s debate. That the California Democrat would try to take on Warren, now a 2020 frontrunner, on something during the night was inevitable â€” multiple other candidates undertook similar maneuvers. Harris did get some flak from observers for harping on this specific issue, though â€” whether Trump should be allowed on Twitter felt to some like a relatively small matter in the grander scheme of the debate.
Others, however, defended her.
Thereâ€™s definitely a debate to be had about Trump on Twitter
Specifics of the Harris-vs.-Warren debate aside, there have long been questions about what to do about the presidentâ€™s Twitter habits. Trump actually said he would give up tweeting at one point during the 2016 election, and he, well, hasnâ€™t.
Some of the tweets are funny. (Remember â€œcovfefe,â€ anyone?) Some of the tweets are market-moving. And they can also have real-world, and at times very serious, implications. Over the summer, Trump released a series of racist tirades against the so-called â€œSquad,â€ a group of four freshman Democratic members of congress who are women of color: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). In one series of tweets, he said that the women should â€œgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.â€ Three of the women were born in the United States, and all four are US citizens.
Trumpâ€™s attacks sparked concerns that his words could inspire violence against the lawmakers, and House Democrats took a vote to condemn the tweets. Trumpâ€™s rhetoric about his opponents has inspired violence before: Cesar Sayoc, the Florida man who mailed pipe bombs to the presidentâ€™s opponents and critics in 2018, was apparently inspired by the presidentâ€™s words.
Twitter has generally held that the presidentâ€™s tweets merit keeping up, even if they are bad. In a 2018 blog post, Twitter laid out its stance on messages from world leaders. â€œBlocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,â€ the company wrote at the time. â€œIt would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.â€
Ahead of the debate, Twitter reiterated its stance, noting that it aims to be a forum for people to be â€œinformed and to engage their leaders directly.â€ The company pointed out that in June it rolled out a new policy that amounts to basically a Twitter jail for world leaders â€” if a public figure puts out a questionable tweet, it will put a warning on it and make it harder to find â€” and listed out areas where it would take enforcement action on anyone, including politicians: promotion of terrorism, threats of violence, posting private information or intimate photos, engaging in child sexual exploitation, or encouraging self-harm.
But, Twitter emphasized, in other cases involving world leaders, it will â€œerr on the side of leaving the content up if there is a clear public interest in doing so.â€
Twitter has yet to put any public figures in its Twitter jail.
We still have a lot to figure out when it comes to online speech
Harris isnâ€™t alone in calling for Trump to be kicked off Twitter. There are multiple online petitions calling for the platform to oust the president. But the debate is also just a minor part of a broader discussion about free speech, internet platforms, and what responsibilities companies have to police the content they host.
Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, internet companies get a type of sword and shield when it comes to content. They are shielded from liability for content users post on their platforms, but they also get to moderate that content as they so choose. When you hear someone complaining that by censoring a tweet or kicking someone off of Facebook or YouTube, theyâ€™re encroaching on their First Amendment rights, thatâ€™s not true. The First Amendment prevents the government from depriving people of free speech; it doesnâ€™t apply to private companies. In fact, if the government were to try to tell companies what content to allow, it would probably be violating their First Amendment rights.
There is debate about whether Section 230 has freed up tech companies from too much accountability, especially as scrutiny on Big Tech overall grows. The free internet is what has allowed the online world to flourish since its inception and given birth to some pretty neat stuff. But itâ€™s also been a petri dish for some scary things as well.
And then thereâ€™s another layer, specific to the United States and Trump, having to do with social media companiesâ€™ efforts to curry favor with the president. Trump, for example, consistently complains that Twitter is intentionally manipulating his particular follower count downward, even though itâ€™s part of a broader effort within the company toward fostering a healthier conversation and clamping down on bots. Dorsey met with Trump earlier this year to try to explain it to him.
Free speech on the internet as a topic of contention isnâ€™t going away, not only when it comes to Trump but really with respect to everyone. Harris may have picked a bit of a small hill to die on during Tuesdayâ€™s Democratic debate, but the underlying issues of her argument are very real.

"Joe Biden says that when deciding whether to vote in favor of invading Iraq in 2002, he took President George W. Bush at his word and was led astray.
â€œ[Bush] looked me in the eye in the Oval Office. He said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program,â€ Biden told NPR in September, explaining his Senate vote. â€œHe got them in and before you know it, we had â€˜shock and awe.â€™â€
To hear the former senator and vice president tell it, Biden was one of the many high-profile Democrats who voted to authorize the Iraq War after the 9/11 attacks, only to regret it immediately after.
But his record, well documented in speeches on the Senate floor, congressional hearings, and press interviews from 2001 through his time in the White House, is that of a senator bullish about the push to war who helped sell the Bush administrationâ€™s pitch to the American public â€” and of a vice president who left an unmistakable imprint on President Barack Obamaâ€™s backing of a dictator in Iraq.
Biden, whose campaign didnâ€™t respond to multiple requests for comment, is one of two 2020 Democratic presidential candidates â€” the other being Sen. Bernie Sanders â€” with congressional records that stretch back to the start of the Iraq War. In the fall of 2002, Biden committed what anti-war activists call the â€œoriginal sinâ€ by voting for the war when he was chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sanders, then a member of the House of Representatives, was vocal in opposition.

Those close to Biden describe his record on Iraq as one less moored in policy than in personal connections. Biden has long touted a dedication to working on the inside, maintaining civility and forming bonds with even those he vehemently disagrees with. Thatâ€™s his formula for making change.
â€œThereâ€™s plenty of room to criticize him, but I donâ€™t think this a purely cynical case of revisionism,â€ one former Democratic Senate aide told Vox about his Iraq record. â€œThe sense in the Senate was that there was a pathway out of this thing, and the Bush administration blew it.â€
But Bidenâ€™s fiercest critics point out that the timeline doesnâ€™t add up. Lawmakers knew from the beginning the shakiness of the Bush administrationâ€™s case for going to war with Iraq, and Biden not only went along with it, he championed it.
Now a decade and a half later, as voters decide if Biden should represent the Democrats against Trump, they will have to decide if Bidenâ€™s checkered history with Iraq may impede him from the ultimate prize. Some have already made up their mind.
â€œWhatâ€™s the central reason that Congress approved the war? Key Democrats like Biden crossed over and made a deal with Bush,â€ says Robert Naiman, with the anti-interventionist Just Foreign Policy group.
Biden voted for â€” and helped advance â€” the Bush agenda
The simple truth is that Biden voted to give Bush broad power to go to war with Iraq. He did so as a top-ranking Democrat in the Senate: the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And he did so at a time when the majority of Americans did not support taking immediate military action.
How he got to that point involves several twists.
The Bush administrationâ€™s campaign for war powers began in the summer of 2002. Vice President Dick Cheney declared definitively that Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction â€” a claim echoed by American intelligence officers, who were called to Congress to detail those weapons, and by the media outlets who quoted them. As we know now, those claims were based on flimsy evidence and turned out to be incorrect.
Bush also said he needed war authorization to add teeth to a diplomatic effort through the United Nations to get inspectors on the ground in Iraq. But the administration wasnâ€™t prioritizing diplomacy; they were asking for a broad war authorization that gave the White House immense freedom to use military force in Iraq.
Biden bought into the Bush administrationâ€™s argument. He elevated the administrationâ€™s concerns about Hussein in the press. And in the months leading up to the vote authorizing war, he organized a series of Senate hearings, in close coordination with the White House, during which he echoed the administrationâ€™s talking points about weapons of mass destruction.

â€œIn my judgment, President Bush is right to be concerned about Saddam Husseinâ€™s relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and the possibility that he may use them or share them with terrorists,â€ Biden said at an August hearing.
â€œThese weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein, or Saddam Hussein must be dislodged from power,â€ he continued. â€œPresident Bush has stated his determination to remove Saddam from power, a view many in Congress share.â€
Those hearings have been characterized by his supporters as Bidenâ€™s attempt to seriously and methodically weigh the price of war. And, to be sure, Biden did note: â€œIf that course is pursued, in my view, it matters profoundly how we do it and what we do after we succeed.â€
But, as has been reported in progressive outlets, the hearings included scant testimony from skeptical anti-war voices. And throughout them, there was vocal opposition among Bidenâ€™s Democratic ranks.
â€œThe administrationâ€™s arguments just donâ€™t add up,â€ Sen. Russ Feingold said on the Senate floor in October 2002. Sen. Paul Wellstone similarly raised concerns, questioning a lack of planning on the Bush administrationâ€™s part to account for the potential fallout from military action. He also raised questions about the potential death toll not only among Americans, but also Iraqi civilians, and the billions of dollars that would have to go toward a rebuilding effort.
Bidenâ€™s skepticism, however, was largely reserved for the Bush administrationâ€™s specific ask: a catch-all war authorization for Iraq. Biden supported a narrower war power authorization prioritizing the WMDs. He joined Republicans Sens. Richard Lugar and Chuck Hagel, the latter of whom would go on to be Obamaâ€™s defense secretary years later, in crafting an amendment to the war authorization to limit the scope of Bushâ€™s powers.
But another Democrat foiled that effort: Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, struck a deal with Bush to authorize the use of military force in a war â€” a move that angered Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate, including Biden. Gephardt, at the time weighing a presidential run, was accused of playing politics.
And Biden blinked.
The vote in the Senate was held on October 11, 2002. The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution passed the Democrat-controlled Senate 77 to 23; 29 Democrats voted in support, including Biden. The final resolution gave Bush broad power to go to war in Iraq.
â€œThe President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq,â€ it reads.
In the hours of debate that preceded the vote, Biden echoed the Bush administrationâ€™s rhetoric.
â€œI do not believe it is a rush to war but a march to peace and security,â€ Biden said on the Senate floor. â€œI believe failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war would occur.â€
Bidenâ€™s wartime alliance with Republicans
Bush declared the start of the war in March 2003 with a campaign of hundreds of airstrikes on military targets intended to â€œshock and aweâ€ Hussein and his forces. By May, Husseinâ€™s government had fallen, and Bush had declared â€œMission Accomplished.â€
But it was only the beginning.

In Bidenâ€™s retelling, the war authorization was only a means to strengthen Bushâ€™s position in diplomatic talks. But to Bush, it was clear the war authorization was more than just diplomatic strategy â€” a sentiment reflected in Bidenâ€™s own rhetoric at the time. Congress had given Bush broad power to use military force, and he did.
â€œI think Biden really did believe that getting a United National Security Council resolution would have gotten the inspections,â€ the former Senate aide said. â€œPretty early on he understood that the situation was not going well. The Bush administration was signaling that we won this thing and Biden, Chuck Hagel, and John McCain were three credible voices saying thereâ€™s something else going on here.â€
Democrats lost control of the Senate in the 2002 midterm elections, meaning Biden also lost control of the Foreign Relations Committee chair. The following years for Biden, until Democrats retook control in 2006, were defined by his close relationships with Republicans like McCain, Hagel, and Lugar, who chaired the Foreign Relations Committee. They travelled to Iraq together, did press tours together, and praised each otherâ€™s judgment (though Bidenâ€™s relationship with McCain would eventually sour in the run-up to the 2008 election).
During this time, Bidenâ€™s position was that the war was â€œvastly underfunded and undermanned,â€ as he told PBS in June 2003. â€œWeâ€™re so woefully unprepared because of judgments made from the failure to plan before we went in of what we were going to do in the aftermath.â€
In July 2003, Biden during a Senate hearing pressed then-Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and two other top officials about the administrationâ€™s low-balling of costs to fund the war, asking, â€œWhen are you guys starting to be honest with us?â€
But even then, Biden wasnâ€™t entirely critical of the decision to invade Iraq.
â€œWe have town councils set up. There is actual nascent democracy beginning to flourish there. The oil fields didnâ€™t get blown up. There is relative peace in the north,â€ Biden said in a July 2003 interview with CNN:
Iâ€™m not suggesting there are not successes. I want us to succeed there, but everybody you will speak to who knows anything about this will tell you we need another 5,000 â€” our own people tell us we need another 5,000 European police officers on the ground now to help train their police. We need another 30,000 forces from other countries to help alleviate the strain on our forces. ... If we donâ€™t make real progress very soon, what will happen is weâ€™ll lose the support of the Iraqi people, and then there will be hell to pay. All weâ€™re trying to do is get us to face up to that straight-up now, make the changes necessary, and letâ€™s win this peace.
Meanwhile, the Bush administrationâ€™s claim that Hussein had amassed weapons of mass destruction was collapsing. Former diplomat Joseph Wilson wrote in the New York Times that same month that heâ€™d found nothing when the CIA sent him to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq had tried to buy uranium there.
In October 2003, Iraq Survey Group inspector David Kay told Congress that they â€œhave not yet found stocks of weapons.â€ In July 2004, a Senate intelligence report found that the US intelligence communityâ€™s prewar assessment of Iraqâ€™s WMD capabilities had been deeply flawed. A British report that same month also found no evidence of WMDs. The final CIA report came out in late September 2004: Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction.
And then Biden changed his story. â€œI never believed they had weapons of mass destruction,â€ he said at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank in October 2004. That statement looks a lot like either a lie in the moment or an inadvertent admission that he had lied in the run-up to the war.
It would be one thing if Bidenâ€™s Iraq legacy ended there. But he would only add to it â€” perhaps in even grander ways â€” from inside the White House.
Bidenâ€™s Maliki decision haunts his Iraq legacy as vice president
The trajectory of Bidenâ€™s vice presidency changed dramatically during a June 2009 national security meeting in the Oval Office. â€œJoe, you do Iraq,â€ President Barack Obama said, turning to his No. 2. With that, the charge to end the war in Iraq â€” one of Obamaâ€™s signature campaign promises â€” was Bidenâ€™s responsibility.
Those in Obamaâ€™s circle say Biden was handed the Iraq portfolio because Obama trusted his years of foreign affairs experience and knowledge about the country. Others were a little skeptical due to Bidenâ€™s Senate record, including his advocacy for splitting Iraq up into three separate regions.
But Iraqis who worked with the Obama White House at the time felt there was another reason Biden got the nod: The president didnâ€™t want to wade into what he viewed as his predecessorâ€™s mess.
â€œThey dealt with us as a legacy and baggage,â€ a senior Iraqi official told Vox, asking for anonymity to speak freely about his interactions with the previous administration. â€œThey werenâ€™t comfortable dealing with Iraq.â€
â€œBiden was more comfortable working with us than the president was,â€ the official said.

There was no question who spearheaded Iraqi policy in the early days of the Obama administration: By 2014, Biden had made 64 calls to Iraq. Obama, meanwhile, had only made four. Itâ€™s why many blame Biden for what happened next â€” the backing of a brutal sectarian leader, the withdrawal of US troops, and the rise of ISIS.
But debate still rages in Washington and foreign capitals: Was he given an impossible task to manage as best he could, or did he repeatedly make the wrong calls when they mattered most?
Biden backs Nouri al-Maliki
Nouri al-Maliki, a Shia Muslim, became Iraqâ€™s US-backed prime minister in 2006 as the country descended into civil war. He was no oneâ€™s idea of a perfect choice, but he did (at least initially) help the US clamp down on widespread violence as the Bush administration sent in a surge of troops in 2007 to quell it.
Biden was against the surge in the Senate. â€œI totally oppose this surging of additional American troops into Baghdad,â€ Biden said in 2006, just before becoming the Foreign Relations Committee chair once again. â€œItâ€™s contrary to the overwhelming body of informed opinion, both inside and outside the administration.â€
Malikiâ€™s assistance, mainly in the form of squashing violent Shia militias, would help him stay in Americaâ€™s good graces for Bushâ€™s final years. He and Bush would even hold weekly video conferences to keep up to date, though the Iraqi premier used the time mostly to gripe about the problems he faced in parliament and the nation writ large.
But it wasnâ€™t until the end of the Bush era and the start of Obamaâ€™s presidency that US officials began to seriously question whether Maliki could lead the divided nation.
Starting in 2008, Maliki â€œbegan a systematic campaign to destroy the Iraqi state and replace it with his private office and his political party,â€ Ali Khedery, a former top US diplomat in Baghdad who was close to Maliki, wrote in the Washington Post. Maliki did this by firing professional military leaders he deemed disloyal and replacing them with cronies. He even forced Iraqâ€™s chief justice to ban some of his top political rivals from participating in crucial 2010 parliamentary elections.
Despite his best efforts, Malikiâ€™s State of Law Coalition lost by only two seats to Ayad Allawiâ€™s al-Iraqiya group in that vote. The result gave neither party a clear majority to lead the country, and there was genuine worry in Washington and Baghdad that negotiations to form a ruling coalition could take a year or longer. That was a major problem, as the US needed someone in power to reauthorize a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) in 2011 allowing American troops to stay in Iraq with certain legal immunities and basing authorities.
So the key question became: Support the winner Allawi, or continue to back Maliki? â€œIt really was heavily in flux after that election,â€ Robert Ford, the deputy US ambassador to Iraq from 2008 to 2010, told Vox about the debate inside the American government.
Top US officials, including Ford and James Mattis, then the top US general for the Middle East, pleaded with Biden not to side with Maliki. By that point violence around the country hadnâ€™t gone away but was manageable, and many thought it was the time to focus on reconstruction and economic issues in Iraq. They felt Maliki, who was increasingly acting as an authoritarian, wasnâ€™t the guy to lead the country forward.
â€œPrime Minister Maliki is highly untrustworthy, Mr. Vice President,â€ the former Trump defense secretary recalls saying in his new book Call Sign Chaos.

Emma Sky, who was the political adviser to Army Gen. Raymond Odierno, the leader of US troops in Iraq, recounted to me a meeting she had with Biden in August 2010. â€œIraqis had voted for change,â€ Sky, a British national, argued to the vice president, â€œand you have to show people that change can come about through politics, otherwise theyâ€™ll revert back to violence.â€
â€œAnd he goes on about how Al Gore really won the 2000 presidential election,â€ she continued. â€œHe kept giving these analogies that werenâ€™t exactly appropriate.â€
But for Biden it was appropriate. As many who came to understand Bidenâ€™s thinking told Vox, he viewed Iraq through two prisms. The first was that its political problems were similar to those in America, where even the highest tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims in Iraq could be overcome like political squabbles between Democrats and Republicans in the US. That led to the second prism, which was that the key to solving Iraqâ€™s issues was to get its people over their ancient hatreds.
â€œLook, I know these people,â€ Biden told Sky in that August 2010 meeting. â€œMy grandfather was Irish and hated the British. Itâ€™s like in the Balkans. They all grow up hating each other.â€
That view bothered Sky. â€œHe really felt he understood Iraq,â€ she told Vox. â€œThatâ€™s pretty scary because even experts are surprised about what Iraq is like.â€
â€œI donâ€™t think Biden is a great intellect. He relies on his instincts and feeling,â€ Sky continued.
That sense seems to have led Biden to back Maliki, despite some advice to the contrary. Part of that was because Biden and others in the administration knew the Iraqi premier well enough to work with him, despite his faults.
â€œThere was a very strong contingent that said Maliki is that devil we know,â€ Jeffrey Feltman, who headed the State Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, said of Biden and others in an interview with the Atlantic in June.
The other reason is that Maliki had more political backing in Iraq to stay in power than Allawi had to take it, as even some of Maliki and Bidenâ€™s critics admitted to me. The Shia firmly supported Maliki â€” as did Iran â€” and it was difficult for Allawi to gain enough support to take over.
Due to Bidenâ€™s backing of Maliki, the US helped to broker a deal that would see him retain the premiership in December 2010 and lead Iraq, even though his party had technically come in second in the election.
Those close to Biden dispute that the US tilted negotiations in Malikiâ€™s favor, saying there wasnâ€™t another viable option. â€œThere was a lot of opposition to him, particularly among the American military, so I was willing to try to delay this thing and see if we could find alternatives,â€ James Jeffrey, who became the US ambassador to Iraq in August 2010, told Reuters five years ago. â€œWe never found one.â€
Even certain Iraqis see it that way, too. â€œI think they had no choice but to work with the key players of the time,â€ the senior Iraqi official told Vox. â€œThe US was stuck, but it wasnâ€™t going to reengineer Iraqi politics.â€
Either way, Maliki kept his job â€” and immediately made the work for the US that much harder.
The US withdraws troops from Iraq â€” and ISIS rises
In 2011, Maliki knew the US was desperate. It wanted a SOFA so it could keep troops in Iraq, giving service members legitimacy to be there and immunity from Iraqi law.
And the premier also surely knew that Biden believed heâ€™d deliver the desired agreement. â€œMaliki wants us to stick around because he does not see a future in Iraq otherwise,â€ Biden said during an October 2010 video conference with advisers. â€œIâ€™ll bet you my vice presidency Maliki will extend the SOFA.â€
But Maliki drove a hard bargain, consistently saying he wouldnâ€™t grant immunity to a single American soldier, which derailed negotiations. One theory for his hardline stance, as former US diplomat in Iraq Barbara Leaf posited to the Atlantic in June, is that he â€œstarted anticipating the end of US troops and the end of people telling him what to do.â€
Whatever the reason, the troops agreement â€” again, one of the main reasons Biden and the rest of the US had scrambled to help organize an Iraqi administration they thought would be friendly to Washington â€” didnâ€™t come through. The lack of a deal forced Obamaâ€™s hand in October 21, 2011, when he ordered the roughly 45,000 US troops in Iraq out of the country by yearâ€™s end.
With more freedom to do what he wanted, Maliki for the next few years continued, and in many cases deepened, his sectarian rule. He built a Shia-dominated sectarian state and refused to take steps to accommodate Sunnis, who already felt disenfranchised by their loss of influence after the US pushed them out of power in 2003. Police killed peaceful Sunni protesters and used anti-terrorism laws to mass-arrest Sunni civilians.
Maliki also made political alliances with violent Shia militias, infuriating and terrifying Sunnis.
ISIS cannily exploited that anger and fear to recruit new fighters from disaffected Sunni communities. With the US distracted by the Arab Spring and the growing civil war in Syria, the Obama administration failed to adequately respond to the clear upswell in the terrorist groupâ€™s ranks by late 2013.
â€œI think the criticism of us that we didnâ€™t see the problem is unfair,â€ Antony Blinken, a top Obama official and now a Biden campaign adviser, told the Atlantic in the June article. â€œItâ€™s fair to say that we were not effective in dealing with it before the fact.â€
When the US did eventually respond, Biden proved instrumental in coordinating it. The US sent warplanes into Iraq to target ISISâ€™s militants and told Iraqi leaders that more assistance would come if Maliki stepped aside. The sense was that Malikiâ€™s leadership would only make the problem worse â€” not to mention that his heavy-handed policies had helped set the conditions for ISISâ€™s rise in the first place.
Despite struggling mightily to stay in power, eventually Maliki stepped down in August 2014. Of course, for some it was too little too late: the US had backed Maliki and withdrew troops that couldâ€™ve helped avert disaster.

But the vice president was also a key player in developing the strategy, touted by US generals ever since, to work with local allies to fight ISIS on the ground and retake the territory it had captured in Iraq and Syria â€” a mission that was eventually completed by the Trump administration in March.
ISIS is still not defeated, and Trumpâ€™s policies in Syria might help it make a comeback. Whatâ€™s more, Iraq still remains in strife, with weeks-long protests rocking the country and threatening widespread violence. The question for many is how much blame Biden shoulders for Iraqâ€™s recent past and current state.
The answer depends on whom you ask.
Has Bidenâ€™s Iraq legacy gotten â€œworseâ€?
Everyone Vox spoke to for this story, even Bidenâ€™s fiercest critics on Iraq, unfailingly said that Biden then had a warm presence, and came to meetings extremely prepared. Few questioned the former vice presidentâ€™s dedication to get Iraq right during his eight years at the White House, and made clear that Bush made the original sin of invading Iraq in the first place.
But how wrong, so to speak, did Biden end up being when Iraq was his charge?
Ford, the former deputy US ambassador to Iraq, told Vox that most of the countryâ€™s ills that time â€” particularly ISISâ€™s rise â€” was Malikiâ€™s fault.
â€œI do not blame the Obama administrationâ€™s decision to withdraw troops entirely from Iraqâ€ because thatâ€™s not what led to ISIS, he said. â€œWhat I do blame are the incredibly sectarian policies of Maliki. That, more than anything, is what really led to the spread of ISIS.â€
But Sky, the top adviser to the US military in Iraq at the time, thinks the Biden-led Iraq policy under Obama was a total failure with far-reaching implications.
â€œBidenâ€™s legacy has gotten worse,â€ Sky told Vox. The Obama administration allowed ISIS to gain strength, fuel instability in Syria, and trigger a refugee crisis that helped foment populist politics in Europe â€” including a vote in favor of Brexit that Sky says mightâ€™ve gone differently otherwise. â€œIn America, you donâ€™t feel the consequences of these wars, youâ€™re far away. But in Europe these problems are all on our doorstep.â€
The debate over Bidenâ€™s Iraq legacy now rests squarely with American voters deciding whether or not he deserves a shot at the top job. Will his time in Iraq and general foreign policy knowledge boost his credentials, or will the problems that faced the Obama administration haunt his candidacy?
That, like Iraqâ€™s future, is still up in the air.

"Itâ€™s a busy, hearing-packed week for the US House of Representatives as members come back from a two-week recess to continue their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
Members of the House Intelligence Committee never really left Capitol Hill during recess. Lawmakers in that committee â€” along with members of the two other committees investigating Trumpâ€™s contacts with Ukraine, the foreign affairs and oversight committees â€” have spent the last two weeks conducting hearings and deposing witnesses in order to determine whether Trump attempted to use the office of president to gain dirt on his political enemies.
So far, these sessions have revealed text messages that appear to support the allegations of a whistleblower who accused Trump of attempting to coerce Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden. The hearings have also raised new questions about the involvement of private citizens in official US foreign policy, including Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
At least four former and current Trump administration officials are testifying in front of lawmakers this week. First up is Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council adviser on Russia. Hill is expected to give her perspective on what the council did and didnâ€™t know about the July 25 call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden.
As lawmakers proceed with these hearings, the committees are also waiting to hear back on whether administration officials will respond to a fresh round of subpoenas issued last week.
Hereâ€™s everything you need to know to get up to speed on another dizzying week of news in Washington.
The week in hearings, explained
Hereâ€™s what we know so far about the impeachment inquiry hearings scheduled so far this week:
Monday, October 14
Fiona Hill, Trumpâ€™s former top adviser on Russia, is appearing in a closed-door session before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight Committees. Hill was a career official who served across six administrations and is not considered a Trump loyalist. She abruptly left the National Security Council about a week before Trumpâ€™s July 25 call with Zelensky. Hill is expected to testify about how the National Security Council was largely in the dark about the activities of other Trump officials and Rudy Giuliani â€” the presidentâ€™s personal lawyer â€” with respect to Ukraine.
Semyon â€œSamâ€ Kislin, an associate of Giuliani, is scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition with House Intelligence Committee staff.
Tuesday, October 15
George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, is scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition. Kent is a career diplomat at the State Department who served in Ukraine from 2015 to 2018. He was supposed to testify earlier but did not show up due to White House pressure.
Wednesday, October 16
P. Michael McKinley, former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, is scheduled to be deposed in a closed-door session.
Thursday, October 17
Former European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland is scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition. Sondland was originally supposed to testify October 8, but the Trump administration initially blocked him from appearing. Sondlandâ€™s testimony could be a pivotal moment for House Democratsâ€™ investigation, particularly as they work to determine whether Trump wanted to trade US military aid for an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter (weâ€™ll get into that more later).
Counselor of the United States Department of State T. Ulrich Brechbuhl is scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition. Brechbuhl is close to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Friday, October 18
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper is scheduled to appear for a closed-door deposition.
What weâ€™ve learned so far in the impeachment inquiry
Reports over the weekend suggest this week could be another big one for Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry, particularly because of what former EU Ambassador Sondland may tell lawmakers and their staff.
The Washington Post reported this weekend Sondland plans to tell Congress that explosive text messages in which the ambassador denied Trump was offering Ukraine a quid pro quo arrangement (the release of congressionally approved military aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden) was simply Sondland relaying a message that Trump told him over the phone.
â€œItâ€™s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,â€ a source familiar with Sondlandâ€™s Thursday testimony told the Washington Postâ€™s Aaron Davis and John Hudson.
If Sondland indeed follows through with that testimony, it could be a watershed moment, precisely because Trump and his White House have used Sondlandâ€™s texts to say there was no quid pro quo as a big part of its defense. If it turns out that message originated from the president himself, it could undercut that argument.
By deposing more diplomats and career service officials, lawmakers are starting to paint a fuller picture of the Trump administrationâ€™s activities around Ukraine. Last week, lawmakers talked to former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch for nearly 10 hours. Among other things, Yovanovitch told them she had been ousted from her post in May after a â€œconcerted campaign against me,â€ led by Giuliani and supported by Trump. Yovanovitch also testified she was targeted for her work on anti-corruption in Ukraine, which she said was interrupting the business interests of some of Giuliani associates in the region.
Giuliani himself is also coming under more scrutiny; last week, CNN reported that prosecutors in the US Attorneyâ€™s Office for the Southern District of New York â€œare examining Giulianiâ€™s involvement in the broader flow of moneyâ€ involving his Ukrainian associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were arrested on charges of violating campaign finance law last week.
Itâ€™s a lot to keep up with, but it means that Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer seems to be in worsening legal trouble. This tangled web around Ukraine means Trump is only going to face more scrutiny from lawmakers going forward. If evidence keeps mounting that Trump tried to engineer his own defense, that scrutiny could result in articles of impeachment.
Democrats are also pushing ahead with subpoenas this week
Democrats have a lot of subpoena deadlines to follow up on this week; theyâ€™re waiting to see if a number of current and former Trump officials will respond to their subpoenas for documents and witnesses.
Itâ€™s worth noting the Trump administration wrote a letter last week saying it wonâ€™t comply with any congressional requests and subpoenas related to the impeachment inquiry, so these will likely turn into court battles. However, some of the individuals Congress has requested documents from are not administration officials; they are not subject to the same broad protection of executive privilege and could comply with the subpoenas of their own accord. And some administration officials could â€” as Yovanovitch did â€” disregard the White Houseâ€™s guidance and cooperate as well.
Subpoenas for current/former Trump officials and departments:
On October 4, congressional committees sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence requesting a list of documents to examine whether Pence had knowledge of Trumpâ€™s July 25 phone call to Zelensky. The White House has said it will not comply.
Sondland was supposed to provide the House Intelligence Committee documents by October 14, but his attorneys said he cannot provide the documents.
Pentagon officials are supposed to turn over records to the committees outlining the delay in military aid to Ukraine, with an October 15 deadline.
Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought has been asked by the committees to turn over documents on the delay of military aid to Ukraine by the same October 15 deadline.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney was subpoenaed on October 4 for documents related to the impeachment inquiry. Heâ€™s supposed to provide the documents by October 18.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed on October 10 for documents related to his contact with Ukrainian president Zelensky in May and June. Heâ€™s supposed to provide the documents by October 18, but hasnâ€™t yet responded.
Subpoenas for Trump associates who are not administration officials:
Giuliani was subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee on September 30 and ordered to produce documents about his work in Ukraine by October 15. Giuliani has said he wonâ€™t comply with the request or testify.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Giuliani associates, were requested to testify before the committees and hand over documents, and committee investigators sent them a formal subpoena on October 10. Parnas and Fruman have so far refused to cooperate with Congress, but they have also been arrested on a separate charge of violating campaign finance laws. Like Giuliani, the two men are exempt from executive privilege protections.
This list shows how wide-ranging the congressional inquiry into Trump and his administration officialsâ€™ dealings with Ukraine has become. But with most of these requests, the Trump administration has already refused to provide documents and witnesses, meaning these requests will get tied up in lengthy court proceedings.
So far, Democrats have had the most success with career administration officials who arenâ€™t Trump loyalists. The big question is how many Trump loyalists they can get to talk to them as well."
"LeBron James, the NBAâ€™s biggest star, finally spoke Monday about the leagueâ€™s free speech crisis over the Hong Kong protests â€” and it didnâ€™t sit particularly well with anyone.
The NBA has been in turmoil since October 4 when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, as Voxâ€™s Matt Yglesias previously explained. Chinese entities responded by canceling TV coverage of exhibition games being played in the country and pulling sponsorship with the Rockets.
The NBA initially distanced itself from Morey, calling his statement â€œregrettable.â€ This, in turn, invited backlash from US fans and politicians of all beliefs, who see themselves in solidarity with the protesters fighting for self-determination.
LeBronâ€™s Los Angeles Lakers were one of the teams in China when the Morey story exploded. But for a week, James â€” the four-time MVP, three-time champion, and biggest name in basketball â€” said nothing (and some of his teamâ€™s public events were canceled). On Monday, he spoke out via Silver Screen and Roll:
â€œI think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say (could affect people),â€ James said. â€œWe all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when youâ€™re not thinking about others, and youâ€™re only thinking about yourself.
â€œI donâ€™t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasnâ€™t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.â€
Vaguely calling Morey uneducated after the GM spoke favorably of pro-democracy protests earned swift rebukes from progressive online NBA fans and conservative politicians online.
James tried to clarify on Twitter that he had meant only that Morey had not considered the consequences of his comments for the emotional and physical safety of the teams and players who were in China when they were made. He wasnâ€™t trying to comment on Hong Kong and China.
James is under no obligation to comment decisively about foreign affairs. But he is the sportâ€™s greatest active player, a noted commentator on racial justice in America, and someone who has been outspoken about racism and politics in the past.
James has called out President Trump for stoking racist sentiments and held a rally with Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race. His comments on China managed to anger both liberals and conservatives, disappointing progressives who have often cheered his comments on racial justice and feuds with the president while proving useful social media fodder for conservatives who were already critics.
Many of his progressive fans have certainly noticed free speech and the cause of human rights seem to apply only in selective circumstances for the NBA. The online right meanwhile called him subservient to Communist China, and Republican senators decided to take an opportunity to chastise James for the Chinese governmentâ€™s actions.
Why LeBron and the NBA catch so much heat over China and Hong Kong
The firestorm over Jamesâ€™s comments neatly encapsulates the problem the NBA, which generally wants to be seen as the progressive American sports league, has faced with the China crisis. Every news story must mention that the league and its players have billions of dollars in business in China. That lends itself to the unavoidable conclusion that free speech is conditional in the NBA â€” up until it puts the money at risk.
As Tom Ziller wrote for SB Nation, after the league rebuked Morey:
The message to NBA players, coaches and staff is that you can be as political as you want so long as it only offends people without real power to affect the bottom line. Silver isnâ€™t afraid of Trumpâ€™s ability to hurt his business, so NBA personalities can say whatever they want about him. But his stance is different when it comes to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who could theoretically rocket the league right out of China if he wanted. That reality informs the NBAâ€™s response, and so far, Silver and the league look awfully bad.
The NBAâ€™s courtship of China has an interesting and complicated origin â€” in the telling of this Ethan Strauss story for the Athletic, the bottom line seems to be that the NBA might be maxing out its market share in the United States. China is seen as fertile and potentially lucrative new ground, a country with millions of fans who first came to the game following Rockets star Yao Ming.
The basketball league certainly isnâ€™t alone. As Terry Nguyen wrote for Vox, many US brands struggle to have it both ways; they risk censorship from China if they are seen as critical of the country, but they could alienate their US customers by kowtowing to an authoritarian government suppressing pro-democracy protests. So they equivocate.
But, however fairly, more was expected of James. And of the NBA. This is a player who is the subject of serious speculation about a future run for political office, though this is not the first time a political crisis involving China has been a PR stumble for James. This is a league with head coaches like Steve Kerr, proudly outspoken on domestic issues (and often against Trump) but who have hushed up over Hong Kong.
Strong majorities of both parties hold unfavorable views toward China, according to the Pew Research Center. Getting squishy on China and free speech isnâ€™t usually a winner in America with progressives or conservatives. The latter, long angry with James for his barbs at Trump, simply saw this as confirmation that Bron is with the communists. But many of the former are disappointed too. This was a star and a league they had come to expect a little more from.

"Weed workers across the country are unionizing, and California just made it easier for them.
On Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a requirement that all cannabis stores enter into so-called â€œlabor peace agreementsâ€ as soon as they have 20 or more employees.
California is now one of two states â€” New York is the other â€” that requires licensed weed shops to make a deal with a formal labor union in which managers promise not to stop workers from joining a union. And in exchange, organizers wonâ€™t encourage labor strikes against the company.
Labor unions have been pushing for these agreements in recent years, as more and more states decriminalize marijuana. They say they want to make sure the $6 billion industry doesnâ€™t exploit workers, who are often paid below the minimum wage or given marijuana instead of wages.
They also see it as a pathway for workers to form a labor union and boost membership. When unionized, cannabis workers have ended up negotiating annual raises, health insurance subsidies, and higher-than-average wages, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which has been organizing cannabis workers across the country since 2011.
California has required cannabis shops to sign labor peace deals ever since 2018, after voters approved a ballot measure that legalized recreational marijuana sales. There was just one problem: the law didnâ€™t include a way to enforce the deals, because it didnâ€™t give businesses a deadline to make them.
The new law, signed Friday, gives businesses 60 days to do so. If they donâ€™t, workers can file a complaint with state labor regulators.
This will â€œprovide employees with clarity on when an employer is failing to comply with the laws and a complaint needs to be filed,â€ said Reggie Jones-Sawyer, the California assembly member who sponsored the bill, according to the industry news site Cannabis Wire.
While the new law represents a small tweak to the current law, it will help unions make inroads in one of the fastest-growing industries. It also represents an unusual approach to labor organizing.
Labor peace deals, explained
The emerging legal marijuana industry is relying on a rare labor strategy once used to organize shipyard workers and casino employees. Theyâ€™re known as labor peace deals, or LPAs.
Each deal varies from workplace to workplace, depending on what both sides negotiate, but they tend to have some things in common.
First, company managers agree not to dissuade workers from unionizing, and they often agree to give employeesâ€™ contact information to labor organizers. They also give unions access to the workplace to meet with employees, as long as organizers donâ€™t disrupt work.
In exchange for access, labor organizers agree not to vilify a company or say negative things about an employer to its workforce. The unions also agree not to encourage workers to go on strike or picket.
As the term suggests, these deals are meant to keep the peace during what can often become a tense unionization process. But the setup only works when employers arenâ€™t trying to stop workers from organizing all together.
For the legal marijuana industry, these deals are sometimes mandated under state law. Aside from California, New York requires its medical marijuana dispensaries to sign labor peace deals. In Illinois, which recently legalized recreational marijuana, the state will consider whether a business has signed such a deal when determining which shops can get a license.
Labor unions, such as the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, have been pressuring states to pass these laws. They see it as a way to boost union membership in a rapidly growing industry.
As the marijuana industry grows, so does union demand
Ten states have fully legalized marijuana sales in recent years, for both medicinal or recreational consumption. About another dozen states allow sales for medical use. As more and more states pass laws allowing businesses to set up shop, the demand for workers will continue to rise.
Itâ€™s hard to determine how many people work in the cannabis industry. Because selling marijuana is still illegal under federal law, the US Department of Labor doesnâ€™t track job growth in the industry. But New Frontier Data, a cannabis market-research and data-analysis firm, estimates that the legal industry employs at least 250,000 people who work directly with the plants. That includes people working in dispensaries, coffee shops, bakeries, patient identification centers, hydroponics stores, and growing facilities.
And the growth of marijuana dispensaries is a trend that labor unions are paying attention to.
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, better known for organizing supermarket employees, is the now the â€œmost powerful cannabis unionâ€ in the country, representing more than 10,000 workers in 14 states, according to Rolling Stone magazine.
â€œIt has negotiated contracts with major operators like MedMen, helped legitimize the movement for cautious politicians, and hammered out pro-worker provisions in multiple state legislatures,â€ writes Josh Marcus for Rolling Stone.
In fact, it was UFCW that forced the federal government to enforce labor rights for cannabis workers. In 2013, workers at a medical marijuana company, Wellness Connection of Maine, walked off the job that winter, protesting the companyâ€™s use of pesticides. The company repeatedly retaliated against workers for trying to unionize with the UFCW, and disciplined several workers who participated in the walkout, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces federal collective bargaining laws.
In October 2013, the company settled the case. By doing so, the NLRB acknowledged that cannabis workers were protected under the National Labor Relations Act â€” the 1935 law that gave workers the right to unionize.
â€œOnly by sticking together, we were able to find the strength to speak out about the gross violations that we saw at work,â€ Ian Brodie, a former Wellness employee, said in a statement after the settlement was reached. â€œBy fighting for our union, we are protecting our customers and shaping the medical marijuana industry into a safe and well regulated industry that provides good jobs and needed medicine for our community.â€
Cannabis companies like unions more than most employers do
Itâ€™s unusual for a company to advertise the fact that its employees are unionizing. But in the legal marijuana industry, thatâ€™s normal â€” a sign that the company is a legitimate business, and not a shady operator growing marijuana in someoneâ€™s garage.
In August 2018, employees for the Have a Heart dispensaries signed the first collective bargaining agreement for cannabis workers in Washington state. The company even wrote a press release to announce it: â€œWe consistently strive to have a positive impact in the neighborhoods where we do business, and we see our partnership with [UFCW Local 21] as part of our commitment to creating a safe and empowering workplace,â€ wrote CEO Ryan Kunkel.
The contract, which covers about 135 workers in the Seattle area, includes comprehensive health care benefits, annual raises, and higher-than-average pay rates for the industry, according to the release. Recreational marijuana sales are fully legal under Washington state law.
Then, last week, cannabis workers in Pennsylvania signed the stateâ€™s first collective bargaining agreement in the industry, according to UFCW Local 1776. They work for Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Solutions, a subsidiary of Vireo Health, which operates in 11 markets with legal cannabis.
The new contract sets base wages for employees and provides them with affordable health care benefits, guaranteed annual raises, generous paid time off, and an employer-funded retirement plan.
Wendell Young, president of the union affiliate, described the contract in a press release as a â€œgreat win for the future of all workers in the cannabis industry.â€
The CEO of Vireo Health, Kyle Kingsley, issued his own statement too, and it suggests that cannabis companies see unions as effective partners in advocating for marijuana legalization.
â€œWe believe that a unionized workforce is key to our companyâ€™s success and look forward to partnering with UFCW to support legislation, such as legalizing adult-use cannabis, that will help create thousands of new middle-class jobs across the Keystone State,â€ he wrote."
"The Trump Ukraine scandal â€” about to enter its fourth week â€” saw a number of outstanding if relatively minor questions answered over the weekend, all while President Trump worked to further define his strategy to counter Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry against him.
The central question around Trumpâ€™s interactions with Ukraine is not whether he pushed that country to investigate potential presidential rival former Vice President Joe Biden, but whether there was quid pro quo in the presidentâ€™s requests to have Biden investigated.
In a Saturday preview of his upcoming congressional testimony, a representative for US ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland indicated the ambassador will tell Congress the answer to the question of whether there was quid pro quo is yes â€” but not the one youâ€™re thinking of. Sondland will reportedly testify that in exchange for Ukraineâ€™s vow to investigate corruption, the administration was promising a coveted White House audience, not the release of military aid. Heâ€™s also said, however, he did not connect administration calls for new corruption investigations and Joe Biden at the time.
Trump himself intensified his attacks on Democratsâ€™ inquiry, calling it â€œbullshitâ€ at a Friday night rally â€” only to shift his strategy on Monday. Thus far, heâ€™s been attacking the inquiry and directing government officials not to cooperate with Democratsâ€™ requests for information. But on Monday, he called on the whistleblower who alerted Congress about his interactions with Ukraine to testify, seeming to argue that the manâ€™s testimony would absolve him of all allegations of wrongdoing â€” although the whistleblowerâ€™s account is already corroborated by information the White House has released.
And the man who set off Trumpâ€™s desire for a Biden investigation â€” the former vice presidentâ€™s son, Hunter Biden â€” worked to neutralize Republican questions and conspiracy theories that he improperly benefitted from his fatherâ€™s office by promising to step down from the board of a foreign company.
Was there an offer of quid pro quo in Trumpâ€™s Ukraine call? Sondland says yes.
The US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, is expected to testify before Congress Thursday about his knowledge of a campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. In particular, he will likely be asked about allegations the president withheld congressionally approved military aid Ukraine needed to continue its fight against Russian aggressors in the hope of pressuring Ukrainian leaders to launch that investigation.
As the US ambassador to the European Union, Sondland wouldnâ€™t seem a likely candidate to be involved with Ukraine, given that nation is not in the EU. However, the ambassador told a Ukrainian news outlet UATV early this year that he had inserted himself into US-Ukraine relations: â€œWe have what are called the three amigos. And the three amigos are Secretary [Rick] Perry, again, Ambassador Volker, and myself. And weâ€™ve been tasked with sort of overseeing the Ukraine-US relationship.â€
He is of particular interest to those directing the impeachment inquiry because of his appearance in text messages Volker gave to lawmakers during his congressional testimony. In those messages, which were among Volker, Sondland, and the current top US diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor, Sondland seems to work to shield the president from allegations of wrongdoing, as Voxâ€™s Andrew Prokop has written:
One State diplomat, Bill Taylor, twice raised concerns that this was connected to Trumpâ€™s demands for investigations and with US politics. And, twice, Ambassador Gordon Sondland responded by urging him to talk on the phone rather than by text message.
â€œAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?â€ Taylor wrote on September 1. â€œCall me,â€ Sondland answered.
Eight days later, Taylor wrote: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.â€ Sondland responded by denying that this was the case â€” and urging him not to text about the matter anymore.
Specifically, Sondland responded to Taylorâ€™s concerns about the security assistance delay by texting (after a four-and-a-half hour pause):
Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trumpâ€™s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quoâ€™s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or [Mike Pompeo] a call to discuss them directly.
The New York Times has reported Sondland crafted that text, a far more formal message than the others Congress has released, after consulting with Trump himself. Trump has been using that text both to defend himself and to shield Sondland from any questions about potential misconduct on the ambassadorâ€™s part.
Saturday, the Washington Post reported Sondland will tell lawmakers that the content of that text was indeed given to him by Trump during a phone call and that he texted it to his colleagues without stopping to verify the messageâ€™s accuracy. â€œItâ€™s only true that the president said it, not that it was the truth,â€ Sondlandâ€™s representative told the Postâ€™s Aaron C. Davis and John Hudson.
Sondland is also expected to tell lawmakers that he â€œbelieved Trump at the time and on that basis passed along assurances,â€ and that more than the question of military aid, he was focused on getting Ukrainian leaders to agree to release a statement announcing they planned to launch new corruption investigations, including into an company on which Joe Bidenâ€™s son served as a board member. In exchange, the Ukrainian president would be invited to the White House.
This, Sondland is expected to say, â€œwas a quid pro quo, but not a corrupt one,â€ his representative said.
After blocking witness testimony, Trump is pushing for Congress to interview the whistleblower
Donald Trump has taken an active role in combating the growing impeachment inquiry he faces. He has lashed out against key figures in that investigation on Twitter and in press conferences, and has worked to undermine the publicâ€™s confidence in the whistleblower himself.
In fact, Trump himself reportedly helped craft a letter his administration sent Congress last week promising it would not cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. As the Daily Beastâ€™s Asawin Suebsaeng and Sam Stein reported Saturday: â€œTrump enthusiastically suggested adding various jabs at Democratic lawmakers and would request that their â€˜unfairâ€™ treatment of him be incorporated into the letter.â€
While he continued that approach throughout most of the weekend â€” for instance, telling an audience in Louisiana that Democratic Party leader and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi â€œhates the countryâ€ and that Democrats are â€œpursuing an illegal, invalid, and unconstitutional bullshit impeachmentâ€ because â€œthey know they canâ€™t win on election dayâ€ â€” the president pivoted Monday and began to argue that Democrats arenâ€™t being thorough enough in their impeachment inquiry.
After weeks of attacking the whistleblower whose complaint launched an impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump is now calling on him to testify before Congress.
The presidentâ€™s call comes in the wake of comments by House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, who told CBSâ€™ Face the Nation House Democrats are reconsidering their efforts to bring the whistleblower to testify before them.
Schiff said the Democratsâ€™ hesitation is due to the president himself: He has repeatedly threatened the whistleblower, who remains anonymous, and the chairman said lawmakers are concerned for the whistleblowerâ€™s safety.
â€œBefore the president started threatening the whistleblower ... we were interested in having the whistleblower come forward,â€ Schiff said. â€œOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected.â€
Democratic lawmakers had hoped to interview the whistleblower in a secure location in order to learn more about the wrongdoing he alleged in his complaint, namely that Trump attempted to trade congressionally approved military aid for a Ukrainian investigation into a potential presidential rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and that the White House attempted to bury records of a call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to start that investigation.
However, Schiff said that evidence related to that call released by the White House, particularly a memo summarizing its contents, and the fact the whistleblower compiled his complaint after speaking to people with firsthand knowledge of the call, make the whistleblowerâ€™s testimony less critical than it once was.
â€œGiven that we already have the call record, we donâ€™t need the whistleblower who wasnâ€™t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,â€ Schiff said.
Though the whistleblowerâ€™s account is already corroborated by the White Houseâ€™s own records, there are still a bevy of other questions Democrats want answered. A number of witnesses will appear before Congress this week, including Fiona Hill, former White House adviser on Russia, and George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary for the State Departmentâ€™s European and Eurasian Bureau.
Sunday, the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s Rep. Jim Himes told ABCâ€™s This Week redacted transcripts of these testimonies â€” and those Congress has already completed â€” will eventually be made available to the public.
Hunter Biden says he will avoid all appearances of conflicts of interest in the future
The Ukraine scandal began because Donald Trump was convinced that Joe Biden used the power of the vice presidency to shield his son, Hunter, from a criminal investigation. There is no evidence to support this, and on the campaign trail Biden has been vehement in his rebuttals to the presidentâ€™s allegations.
Hunter Biden himself, however, has stayed out of the affair, even when Trump began to claim that he used his father not just in his business dealings in Ukraine but in China to make a large business deal that ended with him on the board of a Chinese private equity firm.
Sunday, that changed, as Anya van Wagtendonk explained for Vox:
Sunday, through his lawyer George Mesires, the younger Biden seemed to acknowledge his business dealings had placed heightened scrutiny on his father, while also defending his actions. In a statement, Mesires also explained how Hunter Biden planned to avoid even the appearance of conflicts of interest going forward.
First, the younger Biden pledged to cease all work with any foreign-owned companies in the event that his father is elected president in 2020, Mesires wrote. And ahead of that eventuality, Hunter Biden has said he will step down from the board of BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company, a private equity company backed by Chinese state-owned companies.
...
To avoid questions of whether his work creates a conflict of interest for his father, the statement says Biden plans to resign from the BHR board by the end of this month; it does not specify whether he will give up his stake in the firm, however.
The week begins with a few more questions answered. Following Sondlandâ€™s canceled testimony, it was unclear to what degree the White House would be able to stop witnesses from speaking to Congress; his upcoming appearance and expected remarks suggest the administration will be able to do little to stop testimonies and that at least one official sees some evidence of quid pro quo.
The answer to the question of who is directing the administrationâ€™s response to the inquiry seems to be that it is Trump himself; he has weighed in on legal matters and is certainly setting the tone for the official counterpoints.
We already knew that Hunter Biden didnâ€™t seem to have done the things Trump accuses him of, but the weekend saw him make his case.
Despite all this, there were few hints to the answer to the largest question of all: Will Trump be impeached? The weeks to come will tell."
"Bernie Sandersâ€™s return to the campaign trail will come with a renewed message about the need to reform corporate America â€” and it will be backed by a comprehensive proposal to significantly transfer power to workers in the American economy.
Ahead of the fourth Democratic presidential debate, which will be Sandersâ€™s first campaign appearance since suffering a heart attack on the trail two weeks ago, the Vermont senatorâ€™s campaign unveiled its â€œCorporate Accountability and Democracyâ€ plan Monday. In broad strokes, the plan calls for giving workers ownership stakes in their companies, reversing major corporate mergers, and undoing the Trump administrationâ€™s corporate tax cuts.
Sanders has teased parts of this plan in the press previously, touching on themes Sen. Elizabeth Warren has raised about breaking up big tech, giving workers a seat at the table on corporate boards, and increasing taxes on corporations. But in Sanders style, this plan significantly broadens the scope of the conversation about corporate reform. Itâ€™s big.
Asked over the weekend how he differentiates himself with Warren, Sanders told ABC, â€œElizabeth considers herselfâ€”if I got the quote correctlyâ€”to be a capitalist to her bones. I donâ€™t. And the reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.â€
Sanders has long advocated for curbing rampant inequality with a robust social welfare state, including tuition-free college and Medicare-for-all, paid for by significant tax increases on the wealthy and corporations. In this plan for corporate accountability, heâ€™s laying out the groundwork for a different kind of economy all together.
â€œThis is the most ambitious plan on corporate ownership ever put out by a presidential candidate,â€ Peter Gowan, with the Democracy Collaborative, an economic inequality-focused research institution, said. â€œ[This is] giving real bones to Sandersâ€™ vision of democratic socialism.â€
Bernie wants workers to own a share of the companies they work for

The centerpiece of Sandersâ€™s Corporate Accountability Plan is a proposal to shift power to workers by requiring all large companies â€” those with at least $100 million in annual revenue, and all publicly traded companies â€” to come under partial employee-ownership.
The idea is to require large companies to contribute 2 percent of their stocks annually to an employee-controlled fund until workers control 20 percent of the company, and then pay out the dividends to those workers. The campaign estimates the plan would impact 56 million workers at more than 22,000 companies in the United States.
Those funds â€” dubbed Democratic Employee Ownership Funds â€” would be controlled by an employee-elected board of trustees, and the workers benefiting from them would have the same voting rights as any other shareholder in the company.
This is an idea thatâ€™s been backed most prominently by the United Kingdomâ€™s left-wing Labour Party, which called for the establishment of an â€œInclusive Ownership Fund,â€ with workers possessing 10 percent of equity in all companies with more than 250 employees. Lenore Palladino, a senior economist at the Roosevelt Institute, published research finding that the Labour Partyâ€™s proposal would result in nearly an additional $2,725 per year for the average worker. Sanders campaign estimates their proposal would result in an average dividend payment of over $5,000 per worker every year.
Sanders is pairing this idea with a slate of other proposals to give employees more power at their companies:
Heâ€™s calling for codetermination, requiring 45 percent of large companiesâ€™ boards to be employee-elected. This is similar to Warrenâ€™s business reform plan, which calls for employees to elect 40 percent of company boards.
As with Warrenâ€™s proposal, he also wants to create a Bureau of Corporate Governance at the Department of Commerce, where large companies must go to get federal charters requiring them to follow rules around corporate responsibility.
Sanders wants to ban stock buybacks, the practice where a company buys back its own shares from the marketplace. Sanders had previously proposed, with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), allowing buybacks only if companies first paid their workers more, increased benefits, and secured pensions. This, however, is an outright ban.
He proposes giving workers the right to buy a company if it goes up for sale, is closing, or moving overseas â€” a transition made easier if employees already hold a 20 percent stake in the company.
And he wants to establish a $500 million US Employee Ownership Bank to give workers who want to purchase businesses low-interest loans and loan guarantees.
Overall, this proposal could have enormous impact on the current makeup of the US economy. A Rutgers University study on employee ownership found that employee stock ownership plans have been successful in increasing workersâ€™ assets and in closing racial and gender wealth gaps in the workplace. And research from countries like Germany, which have codetermination policies in place, have much higher levels of pay equality, and have seen positive results on productivity and innovation.

As Matt Yglesias explained for Vox, the current makeup of stock ownership has exacerbated inequality in the United States.
Since 80 percent of the value of the stock market is owned by about 10 percent of the population and half of Americans own no stock at all, [rapidly increasing stock prices] has been a huge triumph for the rich. Meanwhile, CEO pay has soared as executive compensation has been redesigned to incentivize shareholder gains, and the CEOs have delivered. Gains for shareholders and greater inequality in pay has led to a generation of median compensation lagging far behind economy-wide productivity, with higher pay mostly captured by a relatively small number of people rather than being broadly shared. Investment, however, has not soared. In fact, itâ€™s stagnated.
It it this sort of inequality Sanders hopes to combat with his plan, and Gowan argues it could go a long way towards reversing increasing inequality in the US.
â€œReally what this is all this adds up to is a massive redistribution of wealth and power, but it gives employees a bunch of tools to turn their companies into employee owned models,â€ Gowan said.
This plan calls for a retroactive reversal of major corporate mergers
In the early 1980s, the United Statesâ€™ Federal Trade Commission changed the way it approached major mergers; it no longer cared how big of a market share the newly formed companies would have if they merged, or if there would be a monopoly. The name of the game became â€œconsumer welfareâ€ â€” a standard defined by whether economists believed the merger would bring prices down for consumers.
Sanders wants to wind back the clock 40 years, and reestablish market shares as the determining factor in approving or rejecting mergers. His reasoning is a scathing indictment of the FTC, which his campaign argues has stopped being a regulatory body, and has instead used the consumer welfare standard to allow for unfettered corruption, and monopolies that hold back innovation and price gouge American people.
â€œThe FTC has lost its credibility as a regulatory agency,â€ the plan reads. â€œBernie will appoint commissioners who serve the public interest and will end the revolving door of FTC commissioners and staff leaving to work for the very same corporations they were previously in charge of regulating.â€
Sanders also argues the current merger rules are leaving Americans out of work. As examples, his campaign cites a 2018 merger between two mortgage loan companies in Iowa, Ocwen Financial and PHH, that resulted in 2,100 employees being laid off. And it points to a merger this year, when Dominion Energy purchased South Carolina utility SCE&G, and announced buyouts for 1,200 workers, with the expectation that hundred will be laid off.
The shift to a new merger standard is a substantial one â€” and his campaign also sees it as retroactive, calling for a review of all mergers under the Trump administration. It could mean hundreds of companies would be forced to reorganize. While such a plan seems like it would be opposed by the business community in general, Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert with Open Markets Institute, said that isnâ€™t necessarily the case.
â€œSaying that the FTC has failed its mission and lost its credibility as a regulatory agency is important,â€ Stoller said. â€œBernie is coming out with a progressive platform to address monopolies, but it is actually pro-business platform. ... A lot of the pressure from the FTC is coming from the business community.â€
Businesspeople are exerting this pressure on the FTC, Stoller says, because there are many who feel their companies have been squashed by monopolistic entities. So while multinational firms may fight back against this part of Sandersâ€™s proposal, smaller firms may welcome it.
And retroactively breaking up companies is not completely unprecedented. In 1960, for example, a 1957 merger between Proctor and Gamble and Clorox was ruled in violation of antitrust law, and the two were forced to break up. Undoing decades of mergers wonâ€™t be easy, but Sanders believes it is doable despite the legal challenges that such a move would no doubt face.
Sanders wants to undo the Trump corporate tax cuts

Tim Scott (R-SC) during an event celebrating the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the South Lawn of the White House December 20, 2017 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
Sanders, like most Democrats in Congress, has been a vocal critic of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Trump signed into law in late 2017. With this plan, he promises to undo changes made to the tax code that gave a massive windfall to corporations.
His plan calls for restoring the corporate tax rate to 35 percent, where it was before Trumpâ€™s cut brought it down to the current 21 percent. That tax rate would be the same for overseas and domestic income.
â€œSanders, for the longest time, the one thing that has been his push is to go to this full worldwide tax system,â€ Kyle Pomerleau, with the Tax Foundation said. â€œHe proposed that in 2016 and he is really committed to that reform.â€
In a worldwide corporate tax system, corporations are taxed on their earnings in total, whether they are made offshore or domestically. Currently, global profits are taxed when they are brought back to the United States and spent or invested. The idea behind a worldwide system, as Voxâ€™s Dylan Matthews has previously explained, is to â€œreduce the risk of companies misclassifying income as being earned abroad (since income earned abroad is still taxed).â€
But as Pomerleau points out, Sandersâ€™ proposal could also encourage companies to relocate to other countries, or to attempt to pay lower taxes through corporate inversion. While Sandersâ€™s proposal addresses this phenomenon with strict rules around interest deductions, Pomerleau says Sandersâ€™s rules don't account for new businesses looking to incorporate that are interested in cheaper tax rates abroad.
Despite this, Sandersâ€™s campaign maintains that the proposal would be broadly beneficial in raising tax revenues â€” it claims if the plan were currently law, Amazonâ€™s taxes would have been $3.8 billion last year. Chevron would have paid up to $1.6 billion in taxes. In total, should it operate as projected, the change would raise $3 trillion in revenue.
The plan also calls for eliminating the 20 percent deduction pass-through entities â€” companies organized as sole proprietorships, LLCs, partnerships, and S corporations â€” get on their business income.
The deduction for pass-throughs is seen as one of the major loopholes in the Republican tax cuts. It was written in an attempt to make small businesses more competitive with corporations, but it has become a way for the wealthy to obfuscate their actual personal income.
In the end, the plan is standard â€œSanders fare,â€ Pomerleau said. Sandersâ€™s vision for the American tax code lays out what Americans consistently cite as their biggest gripe with the the tax code: that corporations donâ€™t pay their fair share.
Should Sanders become president, this corporate accountability plan will likely be a top priority; there is little of it that can be done without the cooperation of Congress, however. The president can shape their Federal Trade Commission, but cannot rewrite tax code, for example.
Nevertheless, this plan captures the ideas and ideology at the center of Sandersâ€™s campaign: That workers need more power and protections and that corporations need to bear more responsibility for improving the society in which they operate."
"Coloradoâ€™s Democratic leadership isnâ€™t waiting for the rest of the country to sort out where it stands on health care; itâ€™s forging ahead with an idea to build on the Affordable Care Act at the state level.
This week, two state agencies in Colorado unveiled a plan that would establish a â€œpublic optionâ€ â€” of sorts â€” for health care in the state.
The plan creates a â€œstate option,â€ a health insurance plan designed by the state that would be made available to all Colorado residents who buy their own individual health insurance. Itâ€™s not quite a â€œpublic optionâ€ because the state plan is not actually run by the government, like Medicaid are Medicare are. Instead, it would be administered through private insurance companies. But the state would set the rates the insurance companies pay health care providers through this plan.
Colorado intends to get the program up and running by January 1, 2022, at the end of Gov. Jared Polisâ€™s first term in office. Democrats swept the elections statewide in Colorado last November, claiming not just the governorâ€™s office but majorities in both chambers of the state legislature as well. Polis, notably, campaigned on bringing a regional universal, Medicare-like health care option to Colorado in partnership with neighboring states in the western part of the United States. The idea echoed an increasingly popular movement among progressives, currently dominating debate among Democratic presidential candidates for public-run health care. Colorado overwhelming voted against establishing a state single-payer program in 2016 (though the politics of that were complicated).
This proposal is not Medicare-for-All, nor is it a state or regional version of it. Instead, Colorado is proposing something that looks similar to a health care system that Gov. Jay Inslee signed into law in Washington state earlier this summer, which also contracts private insurance companies to offer a state-designed plan.
As the national debate around health care goes in circles, this â€œstate optionâ€ is part of a growing push in more liberal states to build on the Affordable Care Act.
The Colorado â€œstate optionâ€ is aimed at controlling health care costs
The Colorado Division of Insurance and the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing unveiled the plan this week in a nearly 200-page report, which estimated the â€œstate optionâ€ would save Coloradans 9 percent to 18 percent in premium costs compared to other commercial plans.
Hereâ€™s how it works:
Every private health insurance company in the state of a certain size is required to offer the â€œstate optionâ€ plan, which covers essential health benefits, including hospital care, prescription drugs, maternity coverage, preventive services, and mental health care.
Those insurance companies are required to spend 85 percent of the premiums they charge for the plan on patient care (up 5 percent from what Obamacare currently mandates).
The state would set benchmark rates that health care providers can charge insurance companies under the state option; they would be able to charge from 175 percent to 225 percent of what Medicare pays, down from the approximate 289 percent commercial insurance plans currently pay.
That latter part of the plan is a crucial policy measure to cut down health care costs in the state, something Polisâ€™s administration has tackled head-on. Colorado has among the highest hospital costs in the country, which the state government says is the direct result of hospitals failing to contain costs. Colorado hospital costs grew 58.7 percent between 2009 and 2017, when they were 14 percent above the national average, according to a January state report.
By setting rates closer to what Medicare pays, the state hopes insurance companies can negotiate lower prices for other commercial plans as well, with the overall goal of preventing premiums from shooting up for consumers. But while we know that rising health care costs directly result in higher premiums, thereâ€™s no guarantee Coloradoâ€™s price caps would mean people would benefit. Other states that have implemented state-regulated rates, like Maryland, havenâ€™t necessarily seen those savings translate back to consumers.
And needless to say, hospitals arenâ€™t enthusiastic about this idea. The Colorado Hospital Association has already panned the proposal.
â€œColorado hospitals fully recognize that there is much work that needs to be done to address healthcare affordability. But embarking on a path that adds further uncertainty by destabilizing Coloradoâ€™s insurance market, on top of instituting government price controls, will likely cause consequences on the stateâ€™s health care system beyond what is intended,â€ the Colorado Hospital Association said in a statement.
The report estimates enrollment in the individual market would increase by between 4,600 and 9,200 people in the first year. For now, the proposal limits this state option to the individual market, but says that it could be expanded to small business and even large businesses later on.
Colorado is one of many states trying different things with health care. Itâ€™s not easy.
If all goes according to schedule, Colorado intends to implement its plan by 2022. And while itâ€™s not what Polis campaigned on (he advocated for a government-run health care system) it is following in the footsteps of several liberal-leaning states looking to innovate.
Interestingly, Colorado lawmakers have floated actual public options, like a pilot program that would let a small community of Coloradans buy into the medical coverage that state employees receive. But it proved too costly for the small sample size.
In New Mexico, lawmakers are considering a Medicaid buy-in program. In the Pacific Northwest, Washingtonâ€™s governor signed a similar proposal to Coloradoâ€™s that contracts with private insurers to sell state-regulated plans on the stateâ€™s Obamacare marketplace. That plan, which goes into effect in 2021, would pay health care providers 160 percent of Medicare rates. Gov. Inslee is optimistic that premiums under that quasi-public option would be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than the current private plans on the marketplaces.
But in some states â€” like California â€” the push to limit health care costs has been faced with serious pushback. A proposed all-payer system, where California would create a board to set provider rates for all insurance plans using Medicare as a baseline, was shelved after facing serious opposition from the stateâ€™s hospital lobby.
Thatâ€™s a dynamic lawmakers are very familiar with on a national level, where attempts to address the health care system have been muddled in partisan politics and faced serious pushback from private interests.
The architects of Coloradoâ€™s plan are well aware they will be met with opposition. But the proposal is still a draft, and officials are hoping with more feedback this plan can be up and running in the next three years."
"Sometimes, all it takes to unite people is the shrill honking of a chaotic goose. Or rather, the catharsis of becoming a chaotic goose, if only virtually.
Thatâ€™s the most basic pleasure at the heart of Untitled Goose Game, a video game from Australian developer House House that launched in late September and quickly earned widespread acclaim. Its fans have all been won over by the quirky puzzle gameâ€™s endearingly evil antihero: a cunning waterfowl that just wants to cause a ruckus for a laugh.
In its short life so far, Untitled Goose Game has found an audience with everyone from model-turned-entrepreneur and Twitter maven Chrissy Teigen to Blink-182 frontman Mark Hoppus to a variety of international news outlets to PETA, in addition to tens of thousands of players. On Nintendoâ€™s digital marketplace, Untitled Goose Game even held the top spot on the Switch games sales chart the week after its release, beating out a new entry in Nintendoâ€™s own hugely popular The Legend of Zelda franchise to get there. Then there are all the memes. Thereâ€™s fan art of the goose and jokes about what its incessant honking must really mean. Thereâ€™s popular shitposting groups on Facebook, where users share simple jokes and crudely edited images, replete with threads that reference Untitled Goose Game; video game culture websites are left to curate the best Untitled Goose Game memes out there among the many, many options.
The central conceit of Untitled Goose Game â€” which costs a mere $15 and is available to download on the Nintendo Switch console as well as on Mac and Windows PC â€” is extremely simple: Be a goose who is a total trickster. And that simplicity is key to its success.
Players take on the role of a goose that just wants to have some fun at other peopleâ€™s expense, with seemingly little motivation other than to wreak havoc in the name of its own entertainment. But the goose is never overly violent or aggressive â€” itâ€™s too unassuming, and even adorable. Itâ€™s also a bit loud, what with all the honking.
As the goose, players waddle through gardens, backyards, and streets in an English village, messing with the faceless, voiceless residents they meet along the way. If the goose can be said to have a mission statement, it is perhaps best characterized as â€œnyah nyah nyah nyah boo booâ€; the stated objective of the game is to complete a checklist of impish tasks set forth for the goose perform. For example: Steal a little boyâ€™s glasses, then take his toy plane while heâ€™s not looking and give it to a shopkeeper who will make the boy buy it back.
These hijinks all take place in a bloodless, colorful, stylized world full of townsfolk to distract and puzzles to solve, all set to dynamic pieces of classical music adapted from works by the influential French composer Claude Debussy. The gooseâ€™s assigned tasks are directed by some omniscient guiding presence, but that doesnâ€™t really matter; they exist simply to add a semblance of structure to what is otherwise an open playground for the goose to cause a good-natured racket. One of its more charming undertakings, for instance, involves wreaking havoc in a pub by sneaking into the kitchen, stealing an entire set of cutlery, knocking an empty bucket onto a doormanâ€™s head, and performing a honking and wing-flapping routine for a pair of easily amused diners.
The goose may seem a little mean-spirited at times, but because itâ€™s controlled by the player â€” and because its human targets are only a few shades past inanimate, rather than developed characters â€” it functions as a scrappy, lovable hero. Embodying this beaked merchant of mayhem can feel like a satisfying role reversal for any human who has ever encountered an angry goose honking at them in a park.
Untitled Goose Game offers just enough of a challenge to keep a player engaged until theyâ€™ve worked through the gooseâ€™s trickster to-do list. But at the same time, the game is gentle and encouraging, allowing a lot of freedom to maneuver the goose as a player sees fit. You wanna just make the goose honk over and over, like Chrissy Teigenâ€™s young daughter likes to do? Be our guest.
Think of Untitled Goose Game as a virtual playground, one in which the ability to command a rascally goose can feel downright therapeutic. Critics and players alike seem to be responding most strongly to that aspect of the game, lauding the way it grants players the rare opportunity to be a troublemaker without the consequences of real life or the more fraught concerns that tend to arise around other, more violent video games.
â€œUntitled Goose Game is a safe, socially acceptable way to relieve stress,â€ the Washington Post declared shortly after the gameâ€™s release. â€œItâ€™s the new punching a wall. Itâ€™s the new crying at your desk.â€
â€œUltimately, the goose is an agent of chaos and mischief in a world of rules and order. It is an unruly child,â€ wrote Colin Campbell at Polygon, Voxâ€™s sister site. â€œThis is why the game appeals to both adults and to children.â€
â€œI played Untitled Goose Game as if I was out for revenge,â€ crowed Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times. â€œBring it on, people! And I was beyond delighted to have a stealth game that did away with violence and guns. Thank you, House House, for experimenting with how a goose would move and interact with objects. Waddling, it turns out, is just as much fun, if not more, than bombing things.â€
The gameâ€™s rowdy but uncomplicated lead character has become a phenomenon, no weapons necessary.
Itâ€™s been just under three weeks since Untitled Goose Gameâ€™s September 22 release, but the gameâ€™s reception has already far surpassed its creatorsâ€™ expectations. And Nico Disseldorp, one of its four developers, told Australian state news that more than 100,000 copies have been sold â€” an impressive feat for a game produced on a small budget by a four-person team.
To get more insight into Untitled Goose Gameâ€™s meteoric rise, I called up Disseldorp to get the backstory on how the game came to be and why itâ€™s struck such a nerve. Hereâ€™s the full story of how a workplace joke about a video game starring a bratty goose became a full-fledged, delightfully silly bestseller.
Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Untitled Goose Game started as a joke
Allegra Frank
I want to start from the very beginning: Where did the idea come from?
Nico Disseldorp
I guess this story begins at some point probably way back in 2016. We had just finished Push Me Pull You, our previous game. And we were like, â€œOkay, weâ€™re going to pick which of our game ideas that weâ€™ve been kicking around weâ€™re going to work on next.â€ And in the middle of this kind of serious discussion about these ideas that had some substance to them, [designer Stuart Gillespie-Cook] posted an image in our group chat and said, â€œLetâ€™s make a game about this.â€ And he just posted a stock photograph of the goose.
And then that led to us kind of riffing for a while â€” â€œThese are all the different things we like about geese, and these are the things that seem to be funny about them.â€
Partially, it was just that the animals themselves seemed to have a lot of character to them. The fact that geese always seem to be frowning. Itâ€™s this large bird that has a very blank expression but still seems to say a lot. As we looked into it, we realized geese arenâ€™t part of our life, as people who live in an urban area in Australia. But for people who do live near geese, there seems to be this very interesting relationship thatâ€™s going on where people are very afraid of them.
That seemed a bit baffling to us, or a bit hard to comprehend, but very funny. So there was always kind of this joke going around like, â€œOh, the joke idea of the game that we could make is the Goose Game.â€ But it was always a joke.
Then we were prototyping some other things and not making as much progress as we thought. And the Goose Game jokes just kept getting funnier and funnier. At some point, we realized we were more interested in the joke game idea â€” the one that we werenâ€™t going to do â€” than any of the ideas that weâ€™d been taking seriously. So, one morning we just decided, Okay, look, letâ€™s stop, and letâ€™s just try and make the Goose Game. Letâ€™s see what happens.
We didnâ€™t really have a heap of a plan. We just had a premise of, youâ€™ll be a goose. And youâ€™ll be the kind of goose that people seem to be afraid of. All these people who say, â€œIâ€™m scared of geeseâ€ â€” youâ€™ll be that goose, the bad one. And thereâ€™ll be some conflicts between you and people.
We didnâ€™t have much of an idea of how that would actually translate into a video game. We just tried things, and put people in, and made them react in different ways. We kept trying to think of funny things that a goose could do. Eventually a game started forming around it that fit the premise that weâ€™d set for ourselves. At that point, we thought, Weâ€™re starting to grow very fond of our silly Goose Game.
But we really thought that this was a joke that had a pretty niche appeal until it was October 2017. We were going to show the game at [the annual independent games festival Fantastic Arcade in Austin, Texas], and we realized thereâ€™s going to be no website ... So, we should just put something online. Anything. Throw something up to let people see that there is a video game. And if they Google it, theyâ€™ll have a result.
We still didnâ€™t have a title or anything. We thought that we canâ€™t just have â€œGoose Gameâ€ be the name of the trailer, because then everyone will think thatâ€™s the real title of the game. And we wanted to change it later. We ended up putting up the YouTube video with the title Untitled Goose Game, so that it was very clear to everyone that thereâ€™s absolutely zero chance that this would be the actual title of the game. It was completely a placeholder.
And then we were very surprised to find out that our little niche joke that we thought only weâ€™d find funny was resonating with people very strongly. That first video in 2017 became very popular, and it was being shared around as a meme video. It was being shared in a way that didnâ€™t really feel like a video game trailer [would be]. It felt like just a funny internet video. And it had that name, Untitled Goose Game, and after a while we were just like, maybe we donâ€™t need a title.
Allegra Frank
Not having a title seemed like a big part of the initial ... I donâ€™t want to say appeal, because maybe thatâ€™s weird if everyone likes this game because it doesnâ€™t have a title. But already, this conversation sprung up around this game because it had a memorable untitled title. It was eye-catching.
Nico Disseldorp
Yeah. And Iâ€™d say that was definitely not intentional on our behalf. But I think we noticed afterwards, people liked that this video game announcement wasnâ€™t necessarily doing all the things youâ€™d expect a video game announcement to do. It didnâ€™t have a proper title yet. And the video itself wasnâ€™t really edited the way [a video game trailer usually is]. It was a very laid back sort of gameplay video. I think that maybe helped it become more like a viral, funny internet video rather than a classic video game announcement with all the normal trappings.
The game is simple to play, no matter your level or lack of gaming experience
Allegra Frank
I think that was definitely a big part of it, at least for those more aware of whatâ€™s happening in the gaming world: having interesting trailers worked to gain or sustain peopleâ€™s interest. And then we get to release, and the people who already knew about this game and remembered the funny, weird trailers and were already amused by the title latched onto it. But so did people who had no idea what Untitled Goose Game was, who only became aware of it through word of mouth or social media. Itâ€™s endeared itself to every kind of gaming fan.
What do you consider to be the main appeal of Untitled Goose Game, both from your perspective as a developer but also from what youâ€™re learning now about how people are enjoying it?
Nico Disseldorp
I think probably one of the biggest parts is the character, and thatâ€™s kind of where we started as well. Geese are these really interesting, playful animals that are a bit scary and a bit antagonistic, and they have this interesting kind of conflict with humans, and they seem kind of mischievous but also a bit blank. I think people quite like that as a video game character.
But in terms of how it plays, I think that part of it is that there are a lot of people who like to play video games in this way. ... No matter what it is, if you play any video game â€” with any story, any character â€” some people just like to immediately try and make a big mess or break some things or kind of push against the system to see what happens.
A classic example you hear about is people who want to take the ladder away while the Sims are in the pool or something, just to see what happens. And thereâ€™s kind of a playfulness and creativity that comes with being able to feel like youâ€™re working against a system in a game. And I think our game is a game where thatâ€™s your character from the get-go.
Itâ€™s like weâ€™ve made a system thatâ€™s functioning without you and your job is to go in there and mess it up in some interesting ways and have fun doing it.
Allegra Frank
It feels sort of open-ended in that way. But I also do like that there is some structure to the game in terms of there are these tasks you have to do. Itâ€™s not completely like youâ€™re left to your own devices while playing, but at the same time, there are so many different ways to try and finish those tasks.
And I think thatâ€™s part of why Iâ€™ve been so inclined to show it to other people, because itâ€™s not like thereâ€™s this one set way you have to beat this level or this boss or do other typical video game things. Instead, you can just mess around in the environment and youâ€™ll probably stumble your way into getting it right eventually.
Nico Disseldorp
I think one of the things thatâ€™s been the most exciting to me about the reaction to the game is that a lot of people are doing really playful, creative things, like making their own little videos where they have a scenario that weâ€™ve never thought of before that uses the gameâ€™s elements and combines them in a new way. I think people are definitely finding ways to kind of direct their own fun in the game, which I really like.
Allegra Frank
When did you start to notice that people like Chrissy Tiegen and Mark Hoppus were talking about it? People who arenâ€™t games reporters or other game designers?
Nico Disseldorp
It all happened very quickly. I donâ€™t know if I could pinpoint a moment where I realized it was appealing to a broader audience like that, but beyond just the release of this game, I think [the online reception] is something that House House does spend a bit of time thinking about and pays a bit of attention to. We found that our last game, Push Me Pull You, was quite effective at catching the interest of people who donâ€™t play a lot of video games.
And I think through that, we maybe developed a bit of an appreciation for like, â€œOh, these are [elements of a game] that can help [make it appealing] to a larger audience.â€ We kind of think of it as making sure everything that is on the screen is very apparent to someone who walks past and sits next to you, even if they have no prior understanding of the game. Itâ€™s very easy to understand whatâ€™s going on.
So, Iâ€™d say I always thought Untitled Goose Game had a chance of being appreciated by people who donâ€™t play video games. And when we were play-testing the game, we made sure lots of people who didnâ€™t play many video games, or maybe hadnâ€™t played any video games in a decade or something, came into the office and met some of our play-testers. But I would never have guessed that would translate to people who donâ€™t play many video games actually wanting to download and buy it and stuff.
There are probably lots of video games out there that would be really appealing to all sorts of people who donâ€™t play many video games. But the hardest thing [can be for those people to find the games in the first place]. Often, Iâ€™ll find Iâ€™m in a conversation with someone who is like, â€œYou know a lot about video games. I donâ€™t really play them. Iâ€™ve never really found one that speaks to me.â€ And then if I talk to them for a while, I can maybe recommend, â€œI think youâ€™d really like this.â€ And they might play it. And they might like it.
But they might have had very little chance of finding that video game on their own because itâ€™s a small indie game or something thatâ€™s difficult to know about unless you follow that world or have someone recommending it to you. So, maybe thereâ€™s something about the Goose Gameâ€™s popularity â€” combined with the fact that itâ€™s the kind of video game that someone who doesnâ€™t play a lot of video games can understand or appreciate, even if theyâ€™re not playing â€” [that helped it find a much broader audience].
Allegra Frank
When it comes to the non-traditional video game player, we can tell them that Untitled Goose Game is easy to pick up and play, itâ€™s cute, itâ€™s funny, but when it comes down to it, itâ€™s still a video game. How do you talk to people who are learning about the game from Chrissy Teigen tweeting about it?
Nico Disseldorp
I donâ€™t know if we do that very deliberately, really. Certainly when developing the game, thatâ€™s something weâ€™re often thinking about â€” like, â€œThis seems like itâ€™d be too hard to understand for someone who doesnâ€™t know a lot of arcane video game literacy stuff.â€
Now that [Untitled Goose Game has become so popular] and there are people who maybe havenâ€™t played a video game in a long time who are suddenly interested in this video game, we are talking to them. In practical terms, that maybe means that we get a lot of emails just asking, like, â€œSo, can you tell me how you actually download these video games? Do I need to buy something? Does it go on my computer? What do I do?â€
They need some very practical advice â€” things that you might sometimes take for granted, like if youâ€™re selling your video game through an online store, that people will know how to use that online store or something.
It really makes you aware of how many barriers there are to even get to the point where you could play a game like this even if you are interested. As I was saying before, we try and keep those barriers relatively low in terms of making sure the gameâ€™s pretty easy to understand. Youâ€™re still making a video game for a particular platform, and for most of the world, they wonâ€™t have any idea how that works [to purchase it for that platform].
The gameâ€™s simplicity also makes it easy to meme
Allegra Frank
Then there are the people who are very online on Twitter making memes; a big part of how the game has spread online is through memes. Have you guys been paying a lot of attention to the memes? And why is this game so meme-able?
Nico Disseldorp
I think the thing thatâ€™s excited me most is that thereâ€™s kind of popular meme formats that have come out of it. I love that thereâ€™s been kind of recreations of other memes with the Untitled Goose Game characters instead. The classic one is the, â€œShow me what youâ€™ve got,â€ and itâ€™s a knife. Do you remember that Vine?
Anyway, [the parody version is] the goose has a knife.
In terms of why the game is meme-able, I donâ€™t know if I could really say 100 percent. But I suspect that part of it is just that itâ€™s very easy to look at a screenshot of this game and immediately gauge what the conflict is and what the kind of power dynamic is.
Shared culture is such an important part of lots of memes. Thatâ€™s why a popular movie is a good choice for a meme format, because everyone knows the context of the scene. But with lots of video game memes I think it does take a bit of an understanding of the video game to get it. ... So if your video game meme required you to play the video game before or to know a fair bit about it, I think that would be a more limited audience. Whereas I think you could probably look at a goose honking at a wimpy kid and kind of get a gist of it even if youâ€™ve never played Untitled Goose Game before or donâ€™t have any idea what it is.
Untitled Goose Gameâ€™s popularity lies in its universal appeal: Weâ€™re all that goose
Allegra Frank
Are there any particular influences that you guys drew from for the game, especially in creating the humor? Iâ€™ve seen people compare it to slapstick or silent movies from the â€™20s and â€™30s, like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keatonâ€™s work. Very physical humor. Was any of that on your mind when designing the game?
Nico Disseldorp
I wouldnâ€™t say that we had any one comedy genre that we were looking to. The thing that we were always focusing on was this idea that we could find a kind of universal framing for the sorts of gags that we wanted to put in the game, the sorts of things that youâ€™ve seen a hundred times and that might be in silent comedies and cartoons and from all different eras.
We thought [those kinds of jokes] were always good to go for because it means that thereâ€™s kind of a lot of familiarity for players and a lot for them to grasp onto. We figured the thing that we are providing thatâ€™s maybe a bit more original is your participation in those jokes and your opportunities to express yourselves in small ways throughout those jokes. But we were always going for, whatâ€™s the platonic version of this gag, the one that everyone remembers, more than trying to study one particular form of it to get the timing just right.
Allegra Frank
I think thereâ€™s definitely a universality to the humor. Itâ€™s cool when people say itâ€™s like, I donâ€™t know, a Buster Keaton movie. Itâ€™s a family-friendly, kind of old-school, very relatable, understandable humor.
Nico Disseldorp
And I guess the same sets of restrictions probably pushed us there as well, in that the game [doesnâ€™t have any dialogue] so we canâ€™t do spoken gags. It all has to be physical action because of that restriction. The characters donâ€™t talk.
Allegra Frank
I really like that. It is so much like miming. Because the human characters donâ€™t have faces, even.
Nico Disseldorp
Yeah. I guess a lot of that is the restrictions that we had to set ourselves to be able to make this game at all. ... As just a handful of people working on the game, we were like, â€œOkay, if weâ€™re going to have a game with people in it, first things first, theyâ€™re not going to have faces and theyâ€™re not going to talk.â€
Allegra Frank
One last thing for me is that Australiaâ€™s national news service talked to you guys about the gameâ€™s success and you noted that people are writing about Untitled Goose Game as a cultural fad. And â€œfadâ€ can have sort of an ephemeral connotation, Are you worried at all that the attention on Goose Game could fade and people could see it as nothing more than one-and-done memes?
Nico Disseldorp
I guess Iâ€™ll have to think about that going forward. Right now, Iâ€™m not sure I really know. Itâ€™s hard to predict whatâ€™s going to happen. I could never have seen these last few weeks coming. And who knows what will happen next. In some sense, I donâ€™t know if anything could capture everyoneâ€™s attention forever.
I hope even if eventually itâ€™s known and people are getting more used to it, itâ€™s still a fun video game to play. So, maybe it doesnâ€™t really matter if itâ€™s a big cultural moment for however long itâ€™s a big cultural moment for. If people are still having fun playing the game, then thatâ€™s great."
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a plan on Thursday aimed at protecting the rights of LGBTQ Americans, many of whose livelihoods hang in the balance as they await the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in three landmark discrimination cases.
The detailed, 12-page plan includes the creation of a new program to fight violence against transgender women of color; a nationwide ban on conversion therapy; and public manufacture of PrEP, a medication that dramatically reduces the risk of contracting HIV. It also includes support for legislation like the Equality Act, a bill that would ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in the workplace and elsewhere.
Warren was not the only candidate to release a plan around LGBTQ rights ahead of a CNN town hall on the issue Thursday night. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is openly gay, also released a plan, which includes a mentorship program for LGBTQ youth modeled on President Obamaâ€™s My Brotherâ€™s Keeper initiative. The two join other current and former 2020 candidates, including Beto Oâ€™Rourke and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in rolling out plans specifically aimed at protecting the rights of LGBTQ people.
The plans donâ€™t encompass all the reforms that some LGBTQ rights advocates have been calling for in recent years. They donâ€™t, for instance, include calls to repeal FOSTA-SESTA, federal legislation aimed at reducing sex trafficking that many say has instead had the effect of driving up violence against trans women of color. They also donâ€™t include pledges to decriminalize sex work, though Warren writes in her plan that she is open to decriminalization.
Still, the plans are a reminder that candidates increasingly see LGBTQ rights as a key election issue. The Trump administration has made a number of efforts to roll back the freedoms of LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender people. Multiple Democratic candidates have now promised to do the opposite, addressing the disproportionate poverty, discrimination, and criminalization that many LGBTQ people face.
â€œItâ€™s important and frankly outstanding that candidates have sought to address this crisis in the way that many have,â€ said Gillian Branstetter, media relations manager for the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund, speaking specifically of violence against trans people. â€œItâ€™s a mark of the dedication of advocates over decades.â€
What Warrenâ€™s and Buttigiegâ€™s plans contain
Both candidatesâ€™ plans contain a mix of executive actions and legislative fixes to expand LGBTQ rights. Hereâ€™s some of what both their plans entail as well as where they diverge:
Legislation
Both campaigns say theyâ€™d fight to pass the Equality Act, a sweeping bill that would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people. It would prevent LGBTQ individuals from being discriminated against in housing, the workplace, and public accommodations. The bill was first introduced back in 2015 and passed the Democratic-controlled House this year, but it hasnâ€™t gone far with Republicans leading the Senate. In three cases argued this week, the Supreme Court considered whether existing sex discrimination law protects LGBTQ people at work â€” the Trump administration has argued that it doesnâ€™t, and many fear that conservatives in the court will side with the White House. If the court doesnâ€™t act to protect LGBTQ people from discrimination, the Equality Act would be another way to do so.
Both campaigns say they would make it so federal agencies and government contractors canâ€™t discriminate against LGBTQ on the basis of religious freedom. But Warrenâ€™s proposed remedy for this is legislation in addition to executive action; she says she would pass the Do No Harm Act in order to clarify the Religious Freedom Restoration Act canâ€™t be used to curb LGBTQ rights.
Executive actions
Whereas the Trump administration has made the federal government and its agencies much more hostile to LGBTQ people in the last three years, Warren and Buttigieg say they would take a number of executive actions to make the federal government far more friendly to this segment of the population.
From restoring Obama-era protections to beefing up federal enforcement and investigations into anti-LGBTQ discrimination to making non-discrimination a condition for federal grant money, both candidates are making it clear theyâ€™re committed to taking it further than their Democratic predecessor.
Both plans detail how they would make a number of federal programs friendlier, from housing policy to workersâ€™ rights and health care. Among other things, they propose:
Instituting a nationwide ban on conversion therapy.
Reversing the Trump administrationâ€™s ban on transgender service members openly serving, and rolling back restrictions on service members with HIV serving.
Making it easier for a transgender or nonbinary person to change their IDs to better reflect their identity.
Reinstating transgender studentsâ€™ rights under federal law to give transgender children and teenagers more rights at their schools.
Both would put federal resources toward ending LGBTQ homelessness.
Both plans emphasize putting more resources toward boosting the safety of transgender women of color â€” a group that disproportionately faces deadly violence.
The plans diverge in a few areas, especially around health care. Warren is a supporter of Medicare-for-all, while Buttigieg has not gone so far in his health care proposal â€” instead supporting a plan he calls â€œMedicare for All Who Want It.â€ Here are some of the other notable differences:
Warrenâ€™s plan calls for publicly manufacturing the anti-HIV drug PrEP to help lower the cost of the drug and make it available to more people. Warrenâ€™s plan would also increase funding for federal HIV/AIDS programs and research. Buttigieg says his administration would negotiate to lower the cost of the drug.
Warren also says she is open to decriminalizing sex work, although she doesnâ€™t get into specifics on how she would do so. â€œSex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse and hardship,â€ her plan says.
Warrenâ€™s plan also puts a heavy emphasis on workersâ€™ rights; she says she would take executive action to fight workplace discrimination and push for the BE HEARD in the Workplace Act, which aims to end sexual harassment in the workplace, including for LGBTQ workers.
The candidatesâ€™ plans include a lot of LGBTQ advocatesâ€™ policy priorities, though not all of them
While Warren has become known for her detailed policy plans, sheâ€™s not the only candidate with a plan on LGBTQ rights. Buttigieg, for example, pointed to his own experience in his 18-page plan.
â€œTwenty years ago, an awkward teenager at St. Joe High School in South Bend, Indiana, who didnâ€™t know a single out LGBTQ student there, never would have imagined how far we would come as a country,â€ he writes. But, he notes, â€œacross much of our country, discrimination and the ever-present fear of it continue to govern aspects of LGBTQ peopleâ€™s lives.â€
And the two join others in the race with LGBTQ rights plans, including former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke, who released a comprehensive plan in June. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who dropped out of the race in August, had also released a detailed LGBTQ rights agenda, and was praised by trans rights advocates for her attention to the issue of sexual assault, which disproportionately affects trans people.
Some issues important to LGBTQ rights advocates, however, still havenâ€™t been addressed by the 2020 candidates. In particular, Katelyn Burns noted at Vox that many of the candidates, including Warren and Oâ€™Rourke, voted in favor of FOSTA-SESTA, 2018 legislation purportedly aimed at punishing websites that host content related to sex trafficking. In reality, many sex workersâ€™ rights advocates say, the legislation made it harder for sex workers to advertise online, giving them less ability to prescreen clients and making them more vulnerable to violence.
Because trans women of color face high rates of employment discrimination, among other issues, they are overrepresented in sex work. And advocates say that FOSTA-SESTA, rather than preventing trafficking, has actually contributed to the epidemic of violence against trans women of color. Thatâ€™s why the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund is calling for, at the very least, additional oversight of FOSTA-SESTA, Branstetter said.
While none of the 2020 candidates mention FOSTA-SESTA in their LGBTQ rights plans, some are starting to address the larger issue of the decriminalization of sex work, which advocates say is necessary to keep sex workers, including trans women of color, safe from violence. Not to mention, arrest records can also keep them from getting jobs and housing. â€œCriminalization of sex work is an untenable model,â€ Branstetter said.
Though Warren has said she is open to the decriminalization of sex work, Buttigieg and Oâ€™Rourke do not mention decriminalization in their LGBTQ rights plans. Buttigieg has said in the past that the issue, as well as FOSTA-SESTA, deserves debate.
Despite these critiques, the 2020 candidates, in general, have shown an admirable degree of attention to policies that could help LGBTQ Americans, Branstetter said. The National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund has been hosting an ongoing online forum in which it asks candidates where they stand on issues that affect trans people, and which trans people in their lives have inspired them to act. Though LGBTQ rights have gotten relatively little discussion in the debates so far, they have been the subject of a forum in September and will be the focus of a town hall on Thursday night.
â€œSometimes Iâ€™m afraid that when people address this issue, they feel that the only thing they can do is feel guilty about it,â€ Branstetter said, speaking of violence against trans people. â€œI promise thereâ€™s more that everybody can do.â€
Correction: An earlier version of this article said Buttigieg was the first openly gay candidate running for a major party presidential nomination. The first openly gay candidate to do so was Fred Karger, a Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential primary."
"The first major face-off between Trump and the House of Representatives over the impeachment inquiry centers on the unlikely figure of Gordon Sondland.
Before the Ukraine scandal broke, Sondland was little known outside diplomatic circles (heâ€™s the US Ambassador to the European Union) and the Pacific Northwest (where he was a prominent hotelier and political donor).
Yet reports and text messages have revealed that Sondland was deeply involved in President Donald Trumpâ€™s effort to get Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens and into circumstances around the 2016 election.
One Republican senator even claims Sondland told him Trump was withholding military aid from Ukraine until they agreed to do those investigations. And when a diplomat voiced concern about this, Sondland urged him not to text about the matter but rather to talk about it on the phone (which would leave no record of what was discussed).
A curious question in all this is why Sondland, whose ambassador post is based in Brussels, was involved in Ukrainian diplomacy in the first place, given that Ukraine is not in the EU. But President Trump reportedly wanted him involved. Trump often gave him â€œspecial assignments,â€ Sondland has claimed, â€œincluding Ukraine.â€ Sondlandâ€™s donation of $1 million to Trumpâ€™s inauguration may have helped buy him the presidentâ€™s ear. And a trove of text messages turned over to Congress last week makes clear heâ€™s at the center of the effort to pressure Zelensky.
Naturally, House Democrats were eager to hear from Sondland and to get messages on a personal device that Sondland said he had. But in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the Trump administration stepped in and instructed Sondland not to appear for a closed-door deposition scheduled for later that day. That wonâ€™t end the story, though, since Democrats then subpoenaed Sondland, instructing him to appear and testify by next week.
Who is Gordon Sondland?
A developer and luxury hotel magnate from the Pacific Northwest, Sondland has been a donor and an influential player in Oregon and Washington state politics for decades. He is quite wealthy; last year, he disclosed owning a Lear Jet and an art collection he valued between $5 million and $25 million. Locally, he exerted influence on past Democratic governors in Oregon (despite living in Portland, he declared his residence to be in Seattle in order to avoid taxes). Nationally, though, heâ€™s been a solid Republican, giving regularly to the partyâ€™s presidential nominees.
So when Donald Trump won the Republican Partyâ€™s presidential nomination in 2016, it seemed that Sondland would join his team as well: a fundraiser invitation that August named Sondland as the Oregon and Washington co-chair of the Trump Victory committee. But when the press started asking questions about this, Sondland dropped Trump like a hot potato.
At the time, Trump was embroiled in controversy due to his bigoted attacks on the Muslim parents of a slain US soldier who spoke at the Democratic convention. â€œMr. Sondland is a first-generation American whose parents were forced to flee Germany during the years leading up to World War II because they were persecuted for their faith,â€ a spokesperson for Sondlandâ€™s hotel company said in a statement. Because of Trumpâ€™s â€œtreatment of the Khan family,â€ the spokesperson continued, Sondland could not â€œsupportâ€ Trumpâ€™s candidacy.
This supposedly principled stance was quickly abandoned by Sondland once Trump won. Despite no known changes to Sondlandâ€™s ancestry or Donald Trumpâ€™s behavior, Sondland decided to give $1 million to Trumpâ€™s inaugural committee. But he obscured those donations by having them sent through four LLCs rather than under his name, in an apparent attempt to avoid bad press for his flip-flop.
Sondlandâ€™s ambition seems to have been to upgrade himself from a regional power player to a national one. And he got what he paid for. In May 2018, President Trump announced he would nominate Sondland as the US Ambassador to the European Union, and he was confirmed by the Senate without objection the following month. He of course had no diplomatic or federal government experience, but doling out plum ambassador gigs to rich donors is a common bipartisan practice.
Sondland didnâ€™t seem to be a great ambassador to the EU, but Trump had other priorities
As a new ambassador, Sondland quickly â€œgarnered a reputation for his truculent manner and fondness for the trappings of privilege,â€ according to a dishy report by the Washington Postâ€™s Greg Miller, Paul Sonne, Greg Jaffe, and Michael Birnbaum. The Post report revealed:
Sondland seemed to have little interest in doing his actual job in Brussels, instead gallivanting off to various other countries â€œwith little or no coordination with other officials.â€
He â€œacquired a reputation for being indiscreet,â€ including for using his personal phone for official business.
He frequently threw Trumpâ€™s name around and claimed he was acting at the presidentâ€™s behest.
And he brought a wireless buzzer into meetings to â€œsilently summon support staff to refill his teacup.â€
So, heâ€™s a somewhat ridiculous and absurd figure. But he claimed to have Trumpâ€™s ear â€” which would make sense, due to that $1 million inaugural contribution. â€œPresident Trump has not only honored me with the job of ambassador to the EU, but heâ€™s also given me other special assignments,â€ Sondland has said, adding, â€œincluding Ukraine.â€
The Three Amigos
By the spring of 2019, Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been fixated on Ukraine for months and had particularly been trying to get their prosecutor general to launch investigations into Trumpâ€™s political opponents. Those plans, however, were spoiled by Volodymyr Zelenskyâ€™s victory in Ukraineâ€™s presidential election in April. This meant a new regime was coming in â€” and a new set of people would have to be pressured.
So in May 2019, the State Department recalled the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch â€” apparently because Giuliani and other outside Trump allies were agitating for her ouster, viewing her as politically unreliable. (She had not been helpful to Giulianiâ€™s dirt-digging efforts.)
This made Bill Taylor, a State official whoâ€™d had a lengthy career in diplomacy, the top-ranking US diplomat in Kyiv until Trump could get a successor confirmed. But Taylor wasnâ€™t a Trump guy and would be unlikely to aid an effort to skew policy to serve Trumpâ€™s political interests (as events would later prove).
So, as Sondland would later explain to a Ukrainian interviewer, Trump instead â€œtaskedâ€ three other people with â€œoverseeing the Ukraine-US relationship.â€ First, and apparently running the show, was Sondland himself. The other two were Kurt Volker, the part-time, unpaid US special representative for Ukraine; and Rick Perry, the Secretary of Energy. Sondland referred to them as â€œThe Three Amigos.â€
By all accounts, the three amigos genuinely wanted to bring the US and Ukraine closer together. There were strategic reasons to do so (checking Russiaâ€™s influence) as well as financial ones (there was money to be made from natural gas deals with Ukraine). The roadblock, though, was President Trump himself, who professed to have a grudge against the â€œcorruptâ€ country.
And the way to remove that roadblock? Well, Ukraine would have to please Trump by investigating both the Bidens and supposed Ukraine interference in the 2016 election. Trump told the amigos in May that, for Ukraine to make him happy, theyâ€™d have to make Giuliani happy, according to CNN.
Sondland understood the quid pro quo
As the summer went on, Sondland continued to take an active role in the US-Ukrainian relationship. The Post reported that President Zelensky, Jared Kushner, and comedian Jay Leno were among Sondlandâ€™s guests at a private dinner in Brussels in early June. Sondland also attended an early July White House meeting with Ukrainian officials and seemed to allude to the demand for investigations.
His efforts to arrange a phone call between Trump and Zelensky went into high gear in July. On July 19, Sondland texted Volker: â€œLooks like Potus call tomorrow. I [spoke] directly to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. Heâ€™s got it.â€
But the call didnâ€™t happen for a few more days. In that timespan, Bill Taylor (the top US diplomat in Ukraine) mentioned that Zelensky was worried about being used â€œas an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politicsâ€ â€” an apparent allusion to the investigations.
Sondland answered: â€œAbsolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext.â€
The call took place on July 25, and Trump made clear he wanted Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election. A few weeks later, Sondland mentioned to Volker that â€œI think potus really wants the deliverableâ€ and hatched the idea that Zelensky could make a statement, reviewed by the Trump team in advance, announcing the investigations Trump wanted. The Ukrainians, however, never committed to making such a statement.
In late August, the situation escalated, when Politico reported that Trump was blocking hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine. Shortly afterward, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) claims that Sondland told him the aid was being held up unless Ukraine agreed to launch those investigations.
This, it turned out, was not a topic Sondland wanted to discuss via text message. â€œAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?â€ Bill Taylor texted Sondland on September 1.
Sondlandâ€™s only response that day was â€œCall me.â€ But he remained deeply involved in the issue. On September 8, he texted Volker and Taylor that heâ€™d had â€œmultiple convos with Ze, Potusâ€ on the topic.
The four-and-a-half-hour gap
But by September 9, the aid was still held up and Taylor was becoming more and more frustrated. Heâ€™d already threatened to quit if the Ukrainians didnâ€™t get the security assistance. Sondlandâ€™s new idea, it seems, was to have Zelensky give an interview of some kind (the details here are unclear).
â€œCounting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon,â€ Taylor texted.
Sondland answered: â€œBill, I never said I was â€˜right.â€™ I said we are where we are and believe we have identified the best pathway forward. Lets hope it works.â€
But then Taylor went further. â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,â€ he wrote.
This text likely alarmed Sondland. With it, Taylor put in writing an objection he says he made on the phone: that Ukraine aid was being linked to help for Trumpâ€™s reelection.
Four and a half hours passed before Sondland responded â€” and in that timespan, Sondland called President Trump. After consulting Trump, Sondland sent a now-infamous response that echoes White House talking points and reads as designed for public consumption.
So, after calling Trump, Sondland laid out what has since become Trumpâ€™s favorite talking point: â€œno quid pro quoâ€™s.â€ He also took a stiff, formal tone in claiming Trump really, truly wants to evaluate whether Ukraine will embrace reform. And then he sends, in stronger words this time, a warning not to text about this anymore: â€œI suggest we stop the back and forth by text.â€
Two days later, the White House let the military aid for Ukraine go through. Two days after that, news of the whistleblower scandal reached the public for the first time.
The Trump administration blocked Sondland from testifying
So Sondland is in the center of all this and was in contact with both Trump and Zelensky throughout this saga. In theory, he could shed more light on what, exactly, happened.
In particular, one of the ugliest parts of this scandal â€” the allegation that Trump blocked $400 million in military aid for Ukraine as part of this pressure campaign â€” is still disputed. We know Trump blocked the aid, but we havenâ€™t quite seen smoking-gun proof that it was part of a quid pro quo for investigations â€” perhaps because Sondland didnâ€™t want to talk about it via text message.

So, House Democrats got Sondlandâ€™s agreement to appear voluntarily at a closed-door deposition Tuesday. But in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the State Department instructed Sondland not to show up to the deposition after all â€” and he complied, saying that while he was happy to testify and had in fact flown to the US to do so, he was a State Department employee and had to respect the Departmentâ€™s wishes.
So was the administration afraid of what Sondland would reveal? He is a close Trump ally so he might be predisposed to shade his testimony to protect the president. But that loyalty has not exactly been constant (considering his disavowal of Trump during the 2016 campaign) and he doesnâ€™t seem the type to risk prison by lying for Trump.
That loyalty may be tested again. House Democrats subpoenaed Sondland Tuesday evening, calling on him to give them documents by Monday, October 14, and appear at a deposition on Wednesday, October 16. But around the same time, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone announced that the Trump administration would refuse all cooperation with the impeachment inquiry, which means Sondland is caught in the middle. If Democrats decide to go to court to try and force his testimony, he could be their first test case."
"For the fourth time ever in American history, the House of Representatives has launched an impeachment inquiry into a sitting president.
What had been a plodding, tedious process in the House suddenly turned into a whirlwind as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi officially announced the Houseâ€™s plans to dial up its investigations into President Donald Trump after the president pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the business ties of former Vice President Joe Bidenâ€™s son â€” and allegedly withheld federal military aid from Ukraine in order to make it happen.
â€œThe president must be held accountable,â€ Pelosi told reporters. â€œNo one is above the law.â€

The inquiry, as Pelosi noted, is currently in the investigation phase. Six House committees including the Judiciary and Oversight panels are involved in the probe and theyâ€™ll continue gathering evidence. The big question now is whether this impeachment inquiry will turn into the House passing articles of impeachment â€” and how soon that will happen.
The Speakerâ€™s sudden shift on impeachment is notable: It indicates how serious the House is about pursuing this investigation, especially given past concerns about potential political fallout leading up to the 2020 presidential election. She did so after a wave of moderate House Democrats came out in favor of the impeachment inquiry, convinced the Trump/Ukraine revelations merited swift and serious action by Congress.

Your guide to the Donald Trump impeachment saga
Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.
1) What is impeachment?
Impeachment technically refers to a vote by the US House of Representatives to charge a high-ranking government officer with misconduct and begin the process of removing him or her from office. Itâ€™s roughly akin to a grand jury handing down an indictment in a criminal procedure. All kinds of officials can be impeached, and in practice the bulk of impeachment proceedings (15 out of 19) have been directed at federal judges.
But what most people mean when they talk about impeachment is the overall process of removing a president from office. The Constitution says a president may be impeached and removed over charges it describes as â€œtreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.â€
This is a process that is spelled out in the United States Constitution â€” it requires a majority vote of the House to impeach followed by a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove â€” but there arenâ€™t a lot of details provided as to exactly how it needs to work or what constitutes an impeachable offense. Unlike in the criminal code, there are no elaborate rules of procedure or vast set of detailed statutes and case law to guide impeachment. Itâ€™s fundamentally a political process built on the fly by political actors and only rarely used over the course of American history.
But critically, even though impeachment is political, it is universally understood to be something akin to a judicial process. In parliamentary systems, by contrast, itâ€™s broadly understood that itâ€™s appropriate and indeed necessary for the legislature to topple a prime minister over policy disagreements. Not every disagreement necessarily leads immediately to a government collapse or a vote of no confidence, but prompting a collapse is considered a perfectly appropriate thing for a parliament to do.
Impeachment isnâ€™t like that. Itâ€™s meant to be a punishment for some kind of wrongdoing â€” â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanorsâ€ is not defined in the Constitution in any way but itâ€™s something other than a basic disagreement about policy or legislation.
2) How does the formal impeachment process work?
The Constitution doesnâ€™t say much about this other than what is described above but historical precedent has generally seen the impeachment of a sitting president begin with an investigation, also known as an impeachment inquiry.
If members of the House believe the president has committed something that falls into one of the categories of â€œtreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,â€ they have the ability to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. In modern times, formal inquiries were launched against two presidents, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, with the former considered a bit more serious than the latter. (Nixon ultimately resigned before the full House voted on impeachment and Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.)

Generally, the opening of the official inquiry marks one of the first steps in the impeachment process and consists of House lawmakers gathering evidence, subpoenaing witnesses, and reviewing information about the president. It usually begins in the House Judiciary Committee. Interestingly, the chair of that committee, Jerry Nadler, has insisted the House is already undergoing an official impeachment inquiry (mainly for legal reasons weâ€™ll get to in a bit). But the big difference is that this process is now officially sanctioned by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which weâ€™ll get into later as well.
Once House lawmakersâ€™ investigation is complete â€” we donâ€™t yet know when that will be â€” they can decide whether or not to recommend articles of impeachment, or charges to be specifically brought against the president. The House Judiciary Committee would vote on these charges and then advance them to a vote by the full House. The House then decides if it officially wants to charge the president on these counts, a move that requires a simple majority to pass.
If those articles pass or those charges are brought forth, the Senate can hold a trial to decide if they want to convict or acquit the president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the upper chamber will â€œtake upâ€ an impeachment inquiry in this instance, though he could still use procedural tactics to keep the trial itself quite short.
To convict the president and remove him from office, two-thirds of Senators, or 67 of them, would have to vote to do it. Thus far, the House has impeached two sitting presidents but the Senate has not convicted either of them.
3) How many presidents have been impeached?
The House has initiated an impeachment inquiry for three presidents, though it has only charged two with articles of impeachment.
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were both charged with articles of impeachment but acquitted by the Senate. Richard Nixon resigned before the House had the opportunity to charge him.

All three presidents faced impeachment for very different reasons. Johnson was charged with 11 articles of impeachment that centered on his firing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton in 1868 and ongoing disagreements he had with Congressional Republicans over Civil War Reconstruction. (Interestingly, one of the articles of impeachment also called out Johnson for delivering remarks â€œwith a loud voice, certain intemperate, inflammatory, and scandalous harangues,â€ and argued that his behavior was unbecoming of a president.)
Clinton, meanwhile, was charged with two articles of impeachment citing obstruction of justice and perjury in 1998. These charges followed testimony he had given when he claimed he had not had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a statement he later changed.
In Nixonâ€™s case, the House began an impeachment inquiry in 1974 and the Judiciary Committee ultimately approved three articles of impeachment that focused on the presidentâ€™s obstruction of the â€œWatergateâ€ investigation. After the committee passed the articles, Nixon resigned before they could be considered by the full House.
4) Why are presidents impeached?
Thereâ€™s a lot of ambiguity around the types of behavior that can be construed as impeachable offenses.
As described by the Constitution, impeachable offenses are anything that fall under the umbrella of â€œtreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.â€ Because the term â€œhigh crimes and misdemeanorsâ€ is quite broad, House lawmakers have significant leeway in determining what actions they see as worthy of an impeachment inquiry.
Presidents can be impeached, basically, if House lawmakers think theyâ€™ve done something they consider to be an â€œimpeachable offense.â€ Because it is a political process that apes a judicial one, there is a huge amount of subjectivity here.
Across the impeachment inquiries that have been launched into presidents in the past, a common thread has been concern about the abuse of executive power. Johnson was seen as violating the Tenure of Office Act (a measure that has since been repealed) and ignoring Congress when he fired Stanton. Clinton was seen as obstructing justice in his conduct related to the Lewinsky investigation. Nixon was seen as misusing government resources for his own political gain.
All three instances of past presidential impeachments were also started by a House controlled by the opposition party.
5) Werenâ€™t we already in an impeachment inquiry?
Yes. The House Judiciary Committee voted to formally begin an impeachment inquiry on September 12, along party lines. Furthermore, Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler has insisted they have unofficially been pursuing an impeachment investigation for some time.
They passed a â€œresolution for investigative proceduresâ€ that was meant to guide the committee through an â€œinvestigation to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.â€ In other words: an impeachment inquiry.
One of the reasons the committee has already done this is there are separate legal cases making their way through the courts to compel members of the Trump administration to comply with congressional subpoenas. Legal experts say having an impeachment inquiry helps bolster Democratsâ€™ case to enforce those subpoenas and compel Trump administration members to testify.
The big thing that changed at the end of September was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got on board. She previously viewed impeachment as something that could hurt vulnerable moderate Democrats, but that changed after a sudden cascade of support for an impeachment inquiry came from moderates themselves. Pelosiâ€™s support is a really big deal. Sheâ€™s the speaker of the House and will play a huge role in many of the next steps â€” including deciding whether articles of impeachment will be brought to the House floor for a full vote.

â€œThe message from [Pelosi] was all systems go, full steam ahead,â€ said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who is on the House Judiciary Committee. â€œThereâ€™s a very different feeling here, this was a breakthrough day for us.â€
But ultimately, the day-to-day work of the six committees charged with conducting the inquiry â€” Judiciary, Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Ways and Means â€” hasnâ€™t changed all that much. The House Intelligence Committee, chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), will take up the bulk of the investigation into Trumpâ€™s conduct with Ukraine. Ukraine is likely to become a key focus of an impeachment inquiry. The Intelligence Committee is expected to schedule an interview with the whistleblower in the coming days.
Ultimately, whatever these committees turn up could be the fodder for formal articles of impeachment, which would run through the House Judiciary Committee before going to the full House.
6) What does polling say about impeachment? Could this help Trump get reelected?
The polling on impeachment has notably shifted since Democrats formally opened an inquiry into Trump.
While a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted September 20-22 found that 36 percent of respondents wanted Congress to start impeachment proceedings against Trump, compared to 49 percent who didnâ€™t want them to, those numbers have since flipped. In a Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted October 7-8, 49 percent of respondents supported the current impeachment inquiry, while 44 percent of respondents opposed it.
Although itâ€™s still very early to know whether such changes in the public mood will stick, the polls do suggest that House Democratsâ€™ decision to move forward with the inquiry â€” along with the information thatâ€™s come out about the Trump-Zelensky phone call on July 25 â€” could be altering how voters view impeachment. Itâ€™s worth noting, however, that many of these gains in support are being driven by Democrats and, to a lesser extent, Independents: according to a 538 aggregation of several recent polls, 83 percent of Democrats, 44 percent of Independents and 14 percent of Republicans now back the inquiry.
As theyâ€™ve noted in the past, Democrats have a very real fear that impeachment could embolden the president and fire up his base. Certainly, the Fox News crowd is very fired up right now, and Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign is already cutting ads accusing Democrats of single-mindedly attacking him via impeachment.
â€œThe misguided Democrat impeachment strategy is meant to appease their rabid, extreme, leftist base, but will only serve to embolden and energize President Trumpâ€™s supporters and create a landslide victory for the President,â€ Trumpâ€™s campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.
At this point, the polling has only shown a slight uptick in impeachment support from Republicans from 9 percent in early September to 14 percent in October, though itâ€™s still too early to know how exactly this will affect turnout during the election.
7) Whatâ€™s the difference between an impeachment inquiry and articles of impeachment?
An impeachment inquiry is not the same thing as voting on articles of impeachment. They are two different steps in the impeachment process.
An inquiry is the investigation that precedes any vote in committee or on the floor of the House. Articles of impeachment, on the other hand, are the specific charges to be brought against the president.

In the impeachments of both Presidents Nixon and Clinton, the House conducted an impeachment inquiry before moving to pass articles of impeachment. But an inquiry serves another purpose as well: It gives Democrats more tools to try to extract information from unwilling administrations.
In the Watergate era, a court said it would give more legal weight to the Senate Select Committeeâ€™s attempts to get Richard Nixonâ€™s presidential tapes and documents if Congress brought an impeachment inquiry: â€œCongressional demands, if they be forthcoming, for tapes in furtherance of the more juridical constitutional process of impeachment would present wholly different considerations,â€ the District Court opinion from 1974 reads.
A formal impeachment inquiry could help give House Democrats more tools to get information from an administration that has been blocking their attempts to do so. If House Democrats decide their investigation has revealed enough evidence, they could move forward with formal charges â€” otherwise known as articles of impeachment.
The House Judiciary Committee is the committee of jurisdiction on articles of impeachment; they would vote on these charges and then advance them to a vote by the full House. House Democrats could dive into articles of impeachment sooner rather than later, but Pelosi has been clear she wants an air-tight case before jumping to that kind of action.
8) What is Congressâ€™ timeline on this?
Thatâ€™s an open question at this point. House Democrats keep telling reporters the investigation will happen â€œexpeditiously,â€ but they are not ready to pin down an exact date.
However, the 2020 presidential election is looming heavily on Democratsâ€™ minds. First of all, Trumpâ€™s Ukraine call was about getting dirt on a political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president. In other words, Trump appears to be using federal military aid to get a foreign government to meddle in a presidential election, months before the general election starts.
But Democrats may also want to get this done before the general election hits, to avoid this dragging on and becoming even more of a huge political issue.
More immediately, here are the steps that will be taken in the next few weeks. Members of the House Intelligence Committee hope to interview the whistleblower that first alerted them about Trumpâ€™s communication with a foreign leader.

Also, the House is voting on a resolution compelling the White House to release the whistleblower complaint to the House and Senate intelligence committees (the Senate already voted to approve the same resolution on Tuesday). That complaint is expected to reveal a much more complete picture of the communication between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
As the committees dig down into their work, House members are about to go home for a two-week break. While earlier this week some had speculated this might kill the momentum on impeachment, House leaders clearly want Democratic members to go home and talk to their constituents about why theyâ€™re opening up an impeachment inquiry. Itâ€™s a concerted effort to try to change public opinion, which has so far been lukewarm on impeachment.
The events of this week mark a huge acceleration forward, especially given the fact the White House released the summary of Trumpâ€™s phone call with Ukrainian president and we could get the whistleblower complaint soon.
â€œI would not have imagined things moved as quickly as they did in the last week,â€ House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff told reporters on Wednesday.
9) What will the Senate do?
The Senateâ€™s role in an impeachment proceeding is to serve as the â€œcourtâ€ where the charges are reviewed and evaluated. If the House were to approve articles of impeachment, it would be the Senateâ€™s job to analyze these charges in a trial and decide whether to convict or acquit.
As New York Timesâ€™ Charlie Savage points out, although this role is whatâ€™s expected of the Senate, thereâ€™s no procedural requirement that mandates the upper chamber to act on articles of impeachment. It would be possible, for example, for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to decide he wonâ€™t take up these articles in any way and treat it the same way he did Merrick Garlandâ€™s Supreme Court nomination.
In the case that the Senate does take up articles, the lawmakers would effectively be serving as jurors. During former president Bill Clintonâ€™s impeachment proceedings, Chief Justice William Rehnquist presided over the trial.
At this point, Senate Republicans still seem like they are firmly backing Trump. In a final vote on articles of impeachment, two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 Senators, would need to convict in order for them to go through. Otherwise, the president, like Clinton, would be acquitted.

Senate Republicans, for now, seem focused on running interference for the president and offering their own counter-messaging about impeachment. Already, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has condemned House Democrats for pursuing impeachment for political purposes.
â€œInstead of working together across party lines on legislation to help American families and strengthen our nation, they will descend even deeper into their obsession with relitigating 2016,â€ he said in a statement responding to Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry.
The 47-senator Democratic caucus would need at least 20 Republicans to join with them if they wanted to hit the necessary threshold for removing Trump in the Senate. To this day, the Senate has yet to convict any sitting president.

"On Tuesday night, the Trump administration sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her committee chairs an eight-page letter refusing to comply with their impeachment inquiry â€” a letter as constitutionally dubious as it was defiant.
â€œYour inquiry is constitutionally invalid and a violation of due process,â€ the letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone states. â€œYour contrived process is unprecedented in the history of the nation and lacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding.â€
The letter raises a number of procedural complaints, chief among them that the House hasnâ€™t conducted a formal vote to authorize impeachment yet. But, simply put, that doesnâ€™t matter. Legal experts told Vox the White House letter seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the impeachment process works.

Are we in a constitutional crisis yet?
President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration could continue to raise procedural complaints to try to sway public opinion, but constitutionally, itâ€™s not really for them to judge: The Constitution makes it clear the House has the â€œsoleâ€ discretion to impeach and the Senate has the â€œsoleâ€ ability to hold a trial.
In other words, impeachment is purely a function of the legislative branch; not the executive, and not the judicial. A 1993 US Supreme Court case around the impeachment of federal Judge Walter Nixon upheld this finding, saying the courts would not weigh in on Congressâ€™s impeachment procedures because it could violate the separation of powers.
â€œThe important thing is constitutionally, the president is making claims not supported by history, or fact, or previous judicial decisions,â€ Linda Fowler, a congressional and legal expert at Dartmouth College, told Vox. â€œThis [letter] actually says Congress has no prerogative whatsoever with respect to the presidency.â€
Fowler, for one, thinks thatâ€™s entering dangerous new territory for the Constitution, as well as messy political terrain for Trump.
Hereâ€™s what the law saws about impeachment
The Constitution contains just a handful of lines discussing impeachment. But in those scant words, it gives the House and its leaders wide latitude to decide how to handle it.
Hereâ€™s what the Constitution says about the Houseâ€™s role: â€œThe House of Representatives shall choose their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.â€ Likewise, the Constitution gives the Senate the â€œsoleâ€ power to try all impeachments, saying, â€œno person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present.â€
But beyond those lines, there isnâ€™t much more information spelling out exactly how the process should work â€” which gives the House free rein to decide how things can go, including whether to launch the inquiry with a full floor vote or not.
The White House letter argues the current process is not above board, saying, â€œIn the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.â€
Republicans are primarily making an argument based on precedent. The House took a formal vote in the last two impeachments of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, but there is no law stating the House must hold a full vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry before they proceed with one. And, in the case of Nixon, Congress was investigating the president months before the House held a formal vote to authorize impeachment.
As a recent article from Congressional Research Service legislative attorneys Todd Garvey and Jared Cole notes, the House has a number of options to choose from for dealing with impeachment. They could vote on a resolution approving an impeachment inquiry that helps give their committees or a new select committee more investigative power.
Or, they could go another route â€” which looks a lot like what the House is doing now. Hereâ€™s what the Congressional Research Services report says about that:
Rather than considering a resolution that expressly authorizes an impeachment inquiry of the President, the House might take the position that such an inquiry is already underway, and opt to allow its committees to continue their ongoing investigations or begin new inquiries using their existing investigative tools and authorities. It is because those existing investigative tools and authorities have grown over time â€” and now include allowing committee chairs to issue subpoenas and committee staff to take depositions â€” that the practical need for obtaining additional powers from the House may have diminished.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leadership havenâ€™t yet said if theyâ€™ll hold a full floor vote to officially authorize the impeachment inquiry, but history tells us they could after an inquiry has begun. And Pelosi now has enough votes to pass a full impeachment inquiry resolution through the House if she wanted. Fowler questioned why they hadnâ€™t already.
â€œThey have the votes to do it, and they didnâ€™t; they can have a vote tomorrow. That was a weakness in the strategy,â€ Fowler said.
Pelosi could schedule that vote whenever she wants; thereâ€™s nothing preventing her from doing so when Congress returns from its two-week break on Monday â€” but again, thereâ€™s nothing requiring it, either.
The courts have said impeachment is up to Congress
Even if Trump and Republicans keep hammering their argument about precedent, thereâ€™s no sign in the letter they will take Democrats to court to try to dictate how the inquiry plays out. Cipollone writes the White House hopes â€œyou will abandon the current invalid efforts to pursue an impeachment inquiry.â€
Thatâ€™s probably because they know the courts will likely stay out of it: In past cases challenging impeachments (mostly of federal judges), the courts have upheld Congressâ€™s right to impeach and have a trial. The US Supreme Court weighed in on this in 1993, when the House impeached and the Senate convicted Walter Nixon, the chief judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.
Nixon, who was impeached after he refused to leave office even after being convicted on charge of committing perjury, decided to challenge the decision. The Nixon v. United States case went all the way up to the Supreme Court, which dismissed the suit after finding it was nonjusticiable. Then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote in the majority opinion that the Supreme Court would not review the decision, because the Constitution gave the Senate the â€œsoleâ€ power to convict and remove a federal officer.
Furthermore, Rehnquist wrote that because impeachment is a constitutional means to check the power of members of the judicial branch, it would not be proper for the judicial branch to weigh in.
That ruling could make any potential legal case against the current House impeachment inquiry extremely difficult, because the Constitution also gives it sole authority to launch proceedings.
In short, the White Houseâ€™s precedent claims amount to a political ploy, not a legal one.

"There was the woman who says she was fired after she asked about maternity leave. And the woman who says her boss repeatedly criticized her pregnancy weight gain and then let her go after she gave birth. And the one who says that hundreds of her injured co-workers were allowed to take a break from heavy lifting â€” but when she was pregnant, she was told there was no work for her.
While pregnancy discrimination has been illegal in the United States since 1978, all three of these women were pregnant and working in the 2010s. Itâ€™s an issue that has come to the fore in recent days because Sen. Elizabeth Warren, now one of the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has said she was let go from her teaching job in 1971 after her employer learned she was pregnant. Some media outlets have questioned the veracity of her story, as Voxâ€™s Emily Stewart explains. But according to many women who have come forward in recent years, experiences like the one Warren describes werenâ€™t just common in 1971 â€” they remain common today.
The controversy around Warrenâ€™s experience is evidence that as the senator climbs in the polls, sheâ€™s starting to get more scrutiny as a candidate, Stewart points out. But itâ€™s also an opportunity for more sustained attention to an issue that affects thousands of Americans every year, and that Congress could actually do something about.
â€œThis is not a problem that was left behind in the 1970s,â€ Elizabeth Gedmark, a senior staff attorney at A Better Balance, a nonprofit that works on pregnancy discrimination, told Vox. â€œIt is still alive and well.â€
Pregnancy discrimination has been illegal since 1978. But itâ€™s still happening.
Until 1978, pregnancy discrimination was legal in America, Gedmark said. If an employer wanted to fire someone for getting pregnant in 1971, the year Warren says she was let go from her teaching job, there would have been nothing to stop it.
Seven years later, workers got some protection with the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which bars employers from firing or demoting people because they are pregnant. The law also says that employers must treat pregnant workers the same way they would treat others with a similar ability to work. So if the employer would grant light duty to someone with an injury preventing them from lifting heavy objects, that employer is supposed to let a pregnant worker with a similar limitation work light duty as well.
In practice, however, â€œthe standard really is not working for huge numbers of workers,â€ Gedmark said. Even after 2015, when the Supreme Court found in favor of a UPS worker who said she was denied accommodations during her pregnancy when workers with disabilities â€” and even workers who had lost their licenses due to drunk driving â€” got adjusted duties, lower courts routinely rule against women who bring pregnancy discrimination suits, she said.
Itâ€™s often hard for workers to know exactly how other people at the company are being treated, Gedmark explained, which makes proving their case difficult. And even when they can show different treatment, they sometimes lose. Gedmark pointed to the case of Cassandra Adduci, a FedEx worker who says she was denied light duty when her doctor told her not to lift heavy weights during her pregnancy. She came to court armed with a spreadsheet of 261 other FedEx workers who got light duty for reasons other than pregnancy, as A Better Balance details in a 2018 report. She still lost her case.
Itâ€™s hard to know exactly how many people face pregnancy discrimination every year because some never report it. But between 2010 and 2015, almost 31,000 pregnancy discrimination cases were filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to CNN.
Meanwhile, a 2018 New York Times investigation found that â€œmany of the countryâ€™s largest and most prestigious companies still systematically sideline pregnant women,â€ Natalie Kitroeff and Jessica Silver-Greenberg wrote.
One woman the Times reporters spoke to was Otisha Woolbright, who worked at a Walmart deli when she was pregnant in 2013, lifting 50-pound trays of chicken into an oven. Three months into her pregnancy, Woolbright says she started bleeding and was told by her doctors that she needed to transfer to light duty. Walmart eventually granted the request. But Woolbright says she was soon fired â€” three days after she asked about maternity leave.
Women of color are disproportionately affected by pregnancy discrimination, Gedmark said, because they often experience discrimination both for their pregnancy and for their race. People in strenuous jobs are also especially vulnerable because they may need accommodations during their pregnancy and may be fired when they ask for them; these jobs are often low-wage as well, meaning people who face discrimination in them often have little savings to fall back on if they are fired.
But accounts of pregnancy discrimination come from across industries, including from ostensibly feminist workplaces. Melissa Teitel became pregnant with her first child in 2014 while working as director of sales for the fashion label started by designer Prabal Gurung. Though Gurung is an outspoken proponent of womenâ€™s equality who once sent models down the runway wearing T-shirts reading â€œthe future is femaleâ€ and â€œnevertheless, she persisted,â€ Teitel told Vox last year that during her pregnancy, he repeatedly made derogatory comments about her body and weight, saying things like â€œnobody should see those legs.â€ When Teitel requested to do some of her work from home after her baby was born so she could continue breastfeeding, she says she was let go from the company.
A spokesperson for Prabal Gurung said Teitel left of her own accord, and that her account â€œdoes not in any way reflect the spirit or culture of our work space.â€ But Teitel told Vox on Tuesday that years later â€” and more than a year after she first spoke publicly about her experience â€” the memory is still painful.
It was â€œnine months of my life that changed me in a lot of ways and that made my experience of having a baby just horrible,â€ she said. â€œI donâ€™t think that any woman should have to go through that.â€
After Warrenâ€™s story started getting scrutiny, many people came forward on Twitter to share their own experiences of pregnancy discrimination. Warren highlighted some of them in a video released early Wednesday morning. â€œTelling our stories is one way we can fight back,â€ the candidate said.
Advocates are calling for a stronger law to fix the problem
Anti-discrimination advocates hope that attention to Warrenâ€™s story could go beyond scrutiny of her individual case, leading to an increased focus on how to protect pregnant people in the workplace. One key reform, many agree, is the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. The proposed federal legislation would hold employees to a standard similar to that in the Americans With Disabilities Act, Gedmark explained. Employers would have to provide reasonable accommodations for pregnant workers unless it would be an undue hardship for them. This would eliminate the need for pregnant people to compare themselves to other workers and â€œprovide very clear guidanceâ€ for what employers should do, Gedmark said.
The act has been introduced in Congress multiple times and been cosponsored by many of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, including Sens. Warren, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders. In her recently released labor reform plan, Warren pledged to fight for passage of the legislation.
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act currently has little chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. But advocates hope that discussion of Warrenâ€™s history will have the side effect of directing public attention to the severity of pregnancy discrimination today. And people who have spoken out about the discrimination they faced want to see a fairer workplace for others.
â€œI hope that when itâ€™s my daughterâ€™s time to be in the workplace, that things are different,â€ Teitel said."
"General Motors is losing $90 million a day, and thousands of auto workers are draining their savings. Yet thereâ€™s no end in sight for the longest auto workersâ€™ strike in decades.
As the GM strike enters its fourth week, company officials and union negotiators are still fighting about wages, retirement benefits, and the fate of an idled Chevy factory in Lordstown, Ohio. Nearly 50,000 workers are still on strike, picketing outside GM factories across the US.
While both sides have made some progress during the contract talks â€” union leaders say employee health insurance premiums wonâ€™t go up, and theyâ€™ve created a path for temporary factory workers to get permanent jobs â€” bargaining over pay and job security got so heated over the weekend that it spilled into the public.
â€œYou didnâ€™t even have a professional courtesy to explain why you could not accept or why you rejected our package proposal for each item we addressed,â€ Terry Dittes, director of the United Auto Workers union at GM, wrote in an email Sunday to company management, which he then posted online. â€œWe expect the Company to respond and discuss the package proposal we presented yesterday. The law and basic decency require no less.â€
A spokesperson for GM declined to comment Tuesday on the dispute but gave the following statement to Vox: â€œWe continue to negotiate in good faith with very good proposals that benefit employees today and build a stronger future for all of us. We are committed to continuing discussions around the clock to reach a resolution.â€
The outcome of the negotiations has the potential to extend far beyond GM factories. The contract will lay the foundation for upcoming union talks with Ford and Fiat Chrysler too. And what workers get from in the deal will reflect how much bargaining power US factory workers have in an era of globalization.
What auto workers want
When negotiators returned to the bargaining table on Monday, one of the main unresolved issues involved how much to shorten the time it takes for a new worker at GM to reach full pay, according to the Wall Street Journal. Right now, new employees start out making about $17 an hour, and it takes eight years of gradual raises to reach the full $30 base pay. The two sides are also at odds over whether the company should increase contributions to workersâ€™ retirement accounts.
But perhaps the most sensitive issue on the table involves the future of the Lordstown, Ohio, factory that once produced the Chevy Cruze.
General Motors caused an uproar in November when it announced plans to close up to five factories in the US and Canada and cut more than 6,000 jobs in the US. One of those factories was the Lordstown plant. It was terrible news for the 1,400 workers who have since been laid off (several hundred of them have accepted transfers to other factories).
During the recent negotiations, GM reportedly promised to build electric car batteries at a factory near the Lordstown plant, according to Bloomberg. (Itâ€™s also agreed to build an electric truck in the Detroit factory that the company planned to close in January.) The union wants more than just a battery factory in Ohio, because it would only employ a few hundred people at lower wages.
The UAW wants GM to build a new car in Lordstown, even if it means moving the assembly of the Chevrolet Equinox, Blazer, and GMC Terrain SUVs from a factory in Mexico. Right now, GM can pay workers a few dollars an hour in Mexico to build the cars â€” so neither side seems willing to budge.
The strike is hurting GM, and striking workers
Without a doubt, the strike is having a huge effect on the companyâ€™s bottom line. It has essentially stopped production at more than 30 GM factories and slowed production for auto-parts suppliers in the US and Mexico. Thousands of non-union factory workers in Mexico and the US have been temporarily laid off as a result.
Meanwhile, car dealers are struggling to get replacement parts to fix vehicles, forcing customers to wait weeks for service. Thatâ€™s costing GM anywhere from $50 million to $100 million a day from lost factory production.
These losses are climbing by the day, writes Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan research firm specializing in the auto industry. He estimates that GM has lost $660 million during the first three weeks of the strike, and the costs will keep going up as they impact more dealers and parts suppliers. â€œWeâ€™re looking at GM losses spiraling up to $90 Million daily if the strike continues into a fourth week,â€ Anderson wrote in an analysis published Tuesday.
Workers are also getting hit. AEG calculates that workers at GM and its suppliers have lost $412 million in wages through Sunday.
GM workers, who are getting a $250 weekly stipend from the union, shared their pain on social media.
I know it's not a HUGE amount of money, but we are so desperate right now waiting to go back to work and this has at least provided us with a place to live if we end up losing our house this month.
The GM strike has drained all of our savings in the last month.
I feel so lucky!

In Warren, Michigan, GM employees are collecting food, diapers, and baby formula to help striking workers get by.
2020 Democrats are siding with workers
As they wait to return to work, workers have had some high-profile visitors meet them on the picket line.
Several Democratic presidential candidates have stopped by one of the 53 GM factories where autoworkers are on strike for the second week in a row. Sen. Kamala Harris joined the picket line Thursday in Nevada. A week earlier, Sen. Cory Booker stopped by a factory in White Marsh, Maryland.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar was the first to meet with GM employees. She brought workers doughnuts last month as they picketed outside a factory in Detroit, where they build Cadillacs and Chevys.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren later blasted the automaker when she joined a picket line at the same Detroit factory.
â€œGM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America,â€ she said, according to the New York Times. â€œTheir only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.â€
In Kansas City that same day, former Vice President Joe Biden was speaking to GM workers who build the Chevy Malibu and the Cadillac XT4. â€œWe didnâ€™t bail out GM, [United Automobile Workers] bailed out GM,â€ Biden told the crowd. â€œYou gave up more than anybody.â€
These campaign stops are just the latest example of Democrats trying to outdo each other to win the blue-collar vote. Candidates vying for the White House know that union support (and endorsements) are crucial to their success, and theyâ€™ve been working hard to show their support for striking fast-food workers, supermarket employees and now, autoworkers.
President Donald Trump had campaigned in Lordstown in 2016, promising workers he would bring manufacturing jobs â€œroaring back to life.â€ That clearly hasnâ€™t happened. The GM strike gives Democrats a unique opportunity to reach disillusioned Trump voters.
Watching candidates join picket lines shows just how powerful the labor movement has become in recent years, with a record number of workers going on strike. But GM workers are less concerned about politics than they are about paying their bills.
Randilyn Smith, a GM worker in Flint, Michigan, told ABC 12 News that she had to put her house up for sale because she is running out of money. â€œAnd I thought GM would be the way to provide for my family,â€ Smith said.

"The Supreme Court heard three cases on Tuesday that ask whether it is legal to fire workers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. That alone is enough to make them three of the most important employment discrimination cases in many years. But there are additional layers to these cases, layers that could imperil all workers regardless of whether or not they are LGBTQ.
The defendantsâ€™ arguments would reopen long-settled legal arguments, potentially upending much of federal anti-discrimination law in the process.
At the most fundamental level, Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, Bostock v. Clayton County, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC are cases about whether the existing federal ban on sex discrimination forbids employment discrimination against LGBTQ workers. Zarda and Bostock involve Donald Zarda and Gerald Bostock, gay men who allege they were fired because of their sexual orientation. Harris Funeral Homes involves Aimee Stephens, a trans woman who was fired by a boss who claims that he would violate â€œGodâ€™s commandsâ€ if he allowed Stephens â€œto deny [her] sex while acting as a representative of [the] organization.â€
The text of the law bans only â€œsexâ€ discrimination, not discrimination based on a workerâ€™s sexual orientation or gender identity. These cases ask whether concepts like sexual orientation and gender identity are so tightly bound to the concept of sex (meaning gender, not sexual intercourse) that a ban on sex discrimination necessarily protects LGBTQ workers.
They are also the first big test of how the Supreme Courtâ€™s new majority will treat LGBTQ rights cases. Though retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was a conservative, he also authored the Courtâ€™s most important gay rights cases. Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes will tell us a great deal about whether it is possible to assemble a pro-LGBTQ majority on the Supreme Court without Kennedyâ€™s vote.
Zoom out a little further and these three cases loom even larger. In 1989, the Supreme Court held that gender stereotyping is itself a form of sex discrimination â€” a woman may not be fired, for example, because her bosses deem her too masculine in appearance or conduct. Yet, as one federal appeals court explained in 2017, same-sex attraction is â€œthe ultimate case of failure to conformâ€ to a gender stereotype. Something very similar could be said about the stereotypical view that all peopleâ€™s gender must align with the sex they were assigned at birth.
Thus, if the Supreme Court holds that it is lawful to discriminate against gay or trans workers, it could upend the 30-year-old rule against gender stereotyping. All workers â€” straight or queer; trans, cis, or non-binary â€” could become less secure in their jobs. And even if the Court does not go that far, it would be difficult to rule against these plaintiffs without carving out a significant exception to the broad rule that sex stereotyping is not allowed.
As the National Womenâ€™s Law Center argues in an amicus brief filed on behalf of itself and a long list of womenâ€™s groups, â€œthe arguments advanced by the employers, if accepted, would roll back protections against discrimination based on sex stereotyping that has long been understood by federal courts, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), employers, and employees in many parts of the nation as impermissible workplace discrimination.â€
Zoom out a little more and Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes are an acid test that will reveal how committed several justices are to their own stated principles. Many of the Courtâ€™s most conservative members are avowed textualists â€” meaning that they hew to the late Justice Antonin Scaliaâ€™s belief that â€œit is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.â€ The text of the law must be obeyed, under this view, even when that text leads to results that its drafters never would have imagined.
Yet, as I will explain below, the text of the law at issue in these cases, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, is expansive. Indeed, it is so expansive that Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes should be easy wins for the plaintiffs.
These three cases, in other words, will show whether several of the Courtâ€™s conservative members are able to set aside their political views when their own textualist principles lead them to a liberal result. And they will show if the gay rights revolution that Kennedy helped lead will halt â€” or even potentially go in reverse â€” now that Kennedy is no longer on the Court.
When the text of a law is at odds with its originally intended purpose
Title VII prohibits employment discrimination that occurs â€œbecause of [an employeeâ€™s] race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.â€ Thus, on its face, the law bans any kind of employment discrimination that is driven by the employeeâ€™s â€œsex.â€
Only 22 states prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and only 21 prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. So if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the employers in Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes, millions of LGBTQ workers will be left without legal protections.
Thereâ€™s no real argument that Congress intended to prohibit anti-LGBTQ discrimination when it wrote Title VII. In 1965, one year after President Lyndon Johnson signed Title VII into law, an early gay rights group called the Mattachine Society asked the federal government to end a policy declaring openly gay people â€œunsuitable for Federal employment.â€
The governmentâ€™s response was, to say the least, not sympathetic. It said that the policy would remain in place because of
the revulsion of other employees by homosexual conduct and the consequent disruption of service efficiency, the apprehension caused other employees of homosexual advances, solicitations or assaults, the unavoidable subjection of the sexual deviate to erotic stimulation through on-the-job use of the common toilet, shower and living facilities, the offense to members of the public who are required to deal with a known or admitted sexual deviate to transact Government business, the hazard that the prestige and authority of a Government position will be used to foster homosexual activity, particularly among the youth, and the use of Government funds and authority in furtherance of conduct offensive both to the mores and the law of our society.
The government added that â€œhomosexual conductâ€ is â€œa crime in every jurisdiction, except under specified conditions, in Illinois.â€
So it is difficult to imagine that the lawmakers who enacted the 1964 civil rights law intended to ban LGBTQ discrimination when they wrote that law. The Stonewall Uprising, a seminal protest that crystallized the modern queer rights movement, was still half a decade away. The complete federal ban on hiring gay employees was not lifted until 1975.
The defendantsâ€™ best argument is that the original purpose of Title VII clearly was not to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. As the Trump administration states in a brief filed in the two cases involving gay plaintiffs, â€œeven judges who have concluded that Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation acknowledge that in 1964 â€˜sexâ€™ did not refer to â€˜sexual orientation.â€™â€
And, to be clear, this argument â€” rooted in the intended purpose of Title VII â€” is not off limits for most judges. As Justice Stephen Breyer argued in a 2006 book, judges may use many â€œbasic toolsâ€ to interpret a law: the lawâ€™s text, its history, tradition, precedent, the text of the lawâ€™s â€œpurposes,â€ and the â€œlikely consequences of the interpretive alternatives.â€ For judges like Breyer who do not claim that pure textualism is the only legitimate way to read a law, an argument that reading a law expansively is not consistent with the lawâ€™s purpose is entirely in bounds.
Under existing precedents, however, it is out of bounds for a Title VII case.
The plaintiff in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services was a man who allegedly â€œwas forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating actionsâ€ by his male colleagues, including physical assault and a rape threat. In an opinion by Justice Scalia, the Court unanimously agreed that Title VII permitted his lawsuit.
â€œMale-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII,â€ Scalia wrote. â€œBut statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.â€
It does not matter, in other words, what the people who wrote Title VII thought they were accomplishing when they banned sex discrimination. What matters is what the expansive words of the statute â€” all employment discrimination that occurs â€œbecause of ... sexâ€ is banned â€” have to say about a particular case.
This is why Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes should be easy cases. Take the cases with gay plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs are men who allege they were fired because of their sexual attractions to men. But presumably their employer would permit women to work at the company who are sexually attracted to men. Thatâ€™s just basic sex discrimination.
The employers, for what itâ€™s worth, reject this reading of Title VII, arguing that courts must â€œisolate sexâ€ to determine whether discrimination took place. So long as the employer would fire all employees with same-sex attractions, this argument goes, no sex discrimination has taken place. To show sex discrimination, a gay male plaintiff must show that the employer treats gay men worse than lesbians.
But itâ€™s hard to square this argument with Title VIIâ€™s expansive ban on any discrimination â€œbecause of sex.â€ As Zarda says in response to his adversaryâ€™s argument, if a company â€œfired men for loving romance novels, but continued to employ women who loved the same books,â€ that would be sex discrimination. If the same company also â€œfired women (but not men) who love automotive repair manualsâ€ that wouldnâ€™t transform a case about sex discrimination into a case about â€œliterary-orientation discrimination.â€ It would simply â€œdouble the employerâ€™s liability.â€
The analysis in Harris Funeral Homes, the case involving a trans woman, is even more straightforward. Think about this case from the employerâ€™s perspective. That employer believes that Aimee Stephens is a man and that Stephens is forbidden to â€œdenyâ€ her true sex. To keep her job, Stephens must comply with her bossâ€™ understanding of how a man should dress and act.
But this same boss would not require a female employee (or, at least, an employee that the boss believes to be female) to dress like a man and to comply with male gender norms. The bossâ€™ rule is that men must dress and act one way and women must dress and act a different way. Thatâ€™s sex discrimination.
As the appeals court that decided Harris Funeral Homes explained, â€œit is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employeeâ€™s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employeeâ€™s sex.â€
The hidden stakes in these cases
A decision against the plaintiffs in these three cases would leave many Americans without recourse if they are fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. But there are also broader implications. Such a decision could also undercut other civil rights protections that the Supreme Court already recognizes â€” including, potentially, safeguards against sex stereotyping and sexual harassment.
Letâ€™s start with sex stereotyping. The Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins (1989), which recognized that such stereotyping violates Title VII, is a bit messy because the Court did not hand down a single majority opinion. Nevertheless, a clear majority of the Court supported the holding that sex stereotyping is not allowed.
Justice William Brennan wrote a plurality opinion on behalf of himself and three other justices, concluding that â€œCongress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypesâ€ when it enacted Title VII. Justice Sandra Day Oâ€™Connor, meanwhile, wrote a separate opinion concluding that the plaintiff in Price Waterhouse could proceed because she showed that â€œstereotypical attitudes towards women [played] a significant, though unquantifiable, roleâ€ in her employerâ€™s decision not to promote her.
So thatâ€™s four votes for Brennanâ€™s position plus a fifth vote from Oâ€™Connor â€” or a majority of the Court that says sex stereotyping is not allowed.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, meanwhile, wrote a dissenting opinion arguing that â€œTitle VII creates no independent cause of action for sex stereotyping.â€ Kennedy wrote that â€œevidence of use by decisionmakers of sex stereotypes is, of course, quite relevant to the question of discriminatory intent,â€ but he denied that such stereotyping, in and of itself, violates Title VII.
Bear Kennedyâ€™s opinion in mind when you read this passage from the Trump administrationâ€™s brief in Harris Funeral Homes:
Stephensâ€™s and the Sixth Circuitâ€™s sex-stereotyping argument rests on the incorrect premise that Price Waterhouse construed Title VII to prohibit sex stereotypes per se. But that case, which produced no majority opinion, merely recognized that a plaintiff can use evidence that an employer engaged in sex stereotyping to show that the employer discriminated because of sex under the ordinary Title VII rubric. It did not recognize sex stereotyping as a novel, freestanding category of Title VII liability.
The Trump administrationâ€™s position is identical to the position that the dissent took in Price Waterhouse. They are rather brazenly calling for a do-over in that 1989 case, perhaps hoping that the Courtâ€™s current, more conservative majority will pretend that Kennedyâ€™s dissenting view carried the day three decades ago.
The crux of the Trump administrationâ€™s position is that a sex stereotyping plaintiff must prove â€œthat the defendant treated members of one sex less favorably than similarly situated members of the opposite sex.â€ But it is far from clear what this means in practice.
A straight man might not believe that they are being treated â€œless favorablyâ€ than his female colleagues if they are forbidden from engaging in romantic relationships with men, but the gay plaintiffs in Bostick and Zarda would no doubt see that question differently. The question of what constitutes â€œless favorableâ€ treatment can be quite subjective. So the Trump administrationâ€™s position would give the judges of an increasingly conservative federal bench enormous discretion to decide which victims of sex stereotyping should be allowed to prevail.
As the brief from the womenâ€™s groups warns, â€œno principled reason justifies limiting Title VII so as to prohibit some, but not all, forms of sex stereotyping,â€ and any attempt to establish such limits would â€œmake Title VII impossible to navigate for courts, employers, and employees, who would have to guess at whether a particular behavior or conduct related to a sex stereotype is not related to sexual orientation or gender identityâ€”and thus, prohibited by federal lawâ€”or, whether it was tied to sexual orientation or gender identity and then deemed outside the scope of sex discrimination barred by Title VII.â€
Unlike sex stereotyping, sexual harassment is not explicitly at issue in Zarda, Bostock, or Harris Funeral Homes. Yet a decision for the defendants in these cases could eventually signal an end to legal protections for victims of sexual harassment.
As explained above, the central tension in all three of these cases is whether Title VII should be given a textual interpretation or whether its scope should be limited to the way the law was understood in 1964. But the legal concept of â€œsexual harassmentâ€ arose several years after Title VII became law.
Many sources claim that the term was coined by Mary Rowe, an official at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who used term in a 1973 report. In 1979, legal scholar Catherine MacKinnon wrote a seminal book, Sexual Harassment of Working Women, which played a significant role in popularizing the idea that sexual harassment violates Title VII. The Supreme Court didnâ€™t embrace this view until its 1986 decision in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, which held that â€œwhen a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinateâ€™s sex, that supervisor â€˜discriminate[s]â€™ on the basis of sex.â€
Thus, a view of Title VII that leans too hard on how the law was understood in 1964 could potentially wipe out protections for victims of sexual harassment. It could render Title VII a shriveled husk of what itâ€™s been since the Reagan administration.
Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes, in other words, are not simply landmark LGBTQ discrimination cases. They could potentially undercut many of the foundations of Americaâ€™s anti-discrimination law. Should the defendants prevail, the Supreme Court could potentially turn the clock back a third of a century.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s rise in the polls in the Democratic presidential primary race has brought increased scrutiny of her past, including whether she was let go from a teaching job in 1971 for being pregnant. Warren has been telling the story for years. Now, some circles are questioning the veracity of her claims, and she is sticking by them.
Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening: Warren, like many politicians, often tells her personal story on the campaign trail, and has throughout her political career. Part of that story is an anecdote about her first teaching job as a speech pathologist for special-needs children in New Jersey. She was hired for the 1970-â€™71 school year by the Riverdale Board of Education of New Jersey but says she didnâ€™t get a job the following year because she was visibly pregnant with her daughter, Amelia.
She describes it as a pivotal moment in her life: After losing the teaching job, she would later go to law school and eventually land at Harvard, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and in the United States Senate.
Except some media outlets are claiming Warrenâ€™s version of events isnâ€™t accurate. On Monday, the conservative website the Washington Free Beacon published a report it says counters Warrenâ€™s claims. The outlet surfaced a copy of minutes from a board of education meeting in April 1971 showing a unanimous vote to extend Warrenâ€™s teaching contract (her exit followed two months later in June). People have also surfaced a 2007 interview in which Warren paints the scenario in a different light.
None of this necessarily counters Warrenâ€™s story â€” she likely wouldnâ€™t have been visibly pregnant in April, but would have in June, and Warren is sticking by her story. â€œAll I know is I was 22 years old, I was six months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,â€ she said in an interview with CBS News on Monday. Warren also defended her claims on Twitter.
The matter has stirred controversy among Warrenâ€™s detractors, who say, like her claims of Native American heritage, this demonstrates a penchant for bending the truth, and among her supporters, who argue that her story stands up. It also shows the rough terrain Warren now faces as she cements her status as one of the frontrunners in the 2020 presidential race. But beyond that, the matter brings into focus a broader problem women face: discrimination in the workplace.
Warrenâ€™s claims and the controversy around them, explained
After graduating from the University of Houston in 1970 with a degree in speech pathology and audiology, Warren moved with her then-husband, Jim, to New Jersey after his job transferred him there. She was subsequently hired by the Riverdale Board of Education of New Jersey, but after a year on the job, she says she was let go.
â€œBy the end of the school year, I was pretty obviously pregnant,â€ Warren wrote in her 2014 book, A Fighting Chance. â€œThe principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then â€” wished me good luck, didnâ€™t ask me back for the next school year, and hired someone else for the job.â€
She tells the anecdote on the campaign trail often.
But on Monday, the Free Beacon cast doubt onto Warrenâ€™s story after finding minutes of an April 21, 1971, school board meeting in which a second-year teaching contract for her was approved. Then, minutes from a separate board meeting on June 16, 1971, say that her resignation had been â€œaccepted with regret.â€
The Free Beacon and others also pointed to a 2007 interview Warren gave at the University of California Berkeley in which her account of what happened omitted being let go by the principal.
â€œI worked in a public school system with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I didnâ€™t have the education courses, so I was on an â€˜emergency certificate,â€™ it was called,â€ Warren said at the time. â€œI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, â€˜I donâ€™t think this is going to work out for me.â€™ I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.â€
CBS News delved into the controversy and found other pieces of evidence that reference Warrenâ€™s personal life, but no firing:
Local newspaper reports from 1971 also present reasons for her leaving the school alternative to what she describes on the trail. The Paterson News, a local paper, reported that summer that Warren was â€œleaving to raise a family.â€ The next month, a story about the school board hiring a replacement said Warren had â€œresigned for personal reasons,â€ even though the board had voted to â€œappointâ€ Warren to the same speech pathology job that April, according to an earlier report.
Minutes also show that board granted her a provisional certificate in speech pathology in November 1970.
Warren told CBS News that entering into politics had led her to â€œopen upâ€ about â€œdifferent pieces in my life,â€ including this episode, and she stands by her version of the story. The outlet also spoke to two retired teachers who worked at the same school. They said that while they donâ€™t remember anyone being explicitly fired for being pregnant, there was little job security for pregnant women at the time. One former teacher said pregnant women were expected to leave â€œat five months.â€
The senatorâ€™s defenders also note that her timeline adds up: In April, she would have been four months pregnant and therefore not visibly so, but in June, she would have been six months pregnant and unable to hide it. Her daughter was born in September. Some people also pointed to a June 1972 Associated Press article about how New Jerseyâ€™s civil rights division ruled that pregnant teachers couldnâ€™t be pushed out of the classroom.
Eliana Johnson, editor-in-chief of the Free Beacon, said in a phone interview that the documents the publication uncovered â€œseem to undercutâ€ Warrenâ€™s story, though they doesnâ€™t necessarily mean she was lying. She tied this instance to broader pressure political candidates on both sides of the aisle seem to face to craft â€œfoundational mythsâ€ about themselves and sometimes bend the truth, such as Ben Carson claiming he got a West Point scholarship and Richard Blumenthal misrepresenting his military service. â€œIt seems to me that these sorts of claims, whether itâ€™s Democrats or Republicans making them, warrant scrutiny,â€ she said.
Warrenâ€™s campaign declined to comment on the record for this story.
Warren is starting to take frontrunner heat
Warren, who was the first major candidate out of the gate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, has largely avoided criticism by other contenders and heightened scrutiny in the media â€” until now.
She has gained slowly and steadily in the polls and now, alongside former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, is considered one of the frontrunners in the race. In fact, she has almost eclipsed Biden in a RealClearPolitics average of national polls.
As Warren cements her status as one of the leaders of the pack, sheâ€™s all but guaranteed to face more pressure as a candidate and have more reporters â€” and opposition researchers â€” looking into her past. This pregnancy story drama bubbled up most among conservatives and progressive Sanders supporters online.
This isnâ€™t the first time Warren has faced scrutiny over her telling of her personal story. Early on in her presidential bid, Warren came under fire for claims of Native American heritage and releasing DNA results to try to demonstrate the veracity of those claims. (The results showed that she probably had some Native American ancestry, but a small amount.) There is also evidence Warren claimed American Indian heritage on official forms earlier in her career.
This shines a spotlight on pregnancy and gender discrimination in the workplace
Whatever the details of Warrenâ€™s pregnancy and teaching job, the scenario highlights a much broader issue: pregnancy and gender discrimination and the way people with families, especially women, are treated in the workplace.
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, wasnâ€™t passed until 1978, seven years after Warren says she was let go. Despite it, pregnancy discrimination remains a problem. The New York Times earlier this year published a lengthy feature on its persistence in American culture. It found that companies still â€œsystematically sideline pregnant womenâ€ in a number of ways:
In physically demanding jobs â€” where an increasing number of women unload ships, patrol streets and hoist boxes â€” the discrimination can be blatant. Pregnant women risk losing their jobs when they ask to carry water bottles or take rest breaks.
In corporate office towers, the discrimination tends to be more subtle. Pregnant women and mothers are often perceived as less committed, steered away from prestigious assignments, excluded from client meetings and slighted at bonus season.
In light of the controversy surrounding Warren, many women have taken to Twitter to discuss their experiences with pregnancy discrimination, gender discrimination, and having families in the workplace."
"President Donald Trump has made his distaste for a government-run single-payer health care system official, signing an executive order decrying Medicare-for-all and promoting private insuranceâ€™s role in Medicare.
Trump signed an executive order on October 3 to â€œprotect and improveâ€ Medicare with a series of somewhat vague proposals that are aimed at expanding a more market-based approach to Medicare.
There are some provisions in this executive order that are largely uncontroversial, like improving network adequacy, expanding access to tele-health, or reducing the time between drugs being approved by the FDA and their being covered by Medicare.
But the Trump administrationâ€™s explicit intent to promote Medicare Advantage, a program that allows Medicare enrollees to opt into private qualified plans, could have major implications for the current Medicare system. The order is a bit of a â€œRorschach test,â€ said Kaiser Family Foundation Medicare expert Tricia Neuman, one with many possibly interpretations.
â€œThe biggest implication is that despite the phrasing that this is designed to protect and improve Medicare, to the extent there are improvements they are all focused on the private Medicare Advantage plans that are by most measures overpaid compared to normal Medicare,â€ Paul Van de Water of the liberal think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said of the plan. â€œThe Executive Order continues to privilege the Medicare Advantage plans and make some proposals that could disadvantage two-thirds of the Medicare enrollees.â€
It also should be noted that Trumpâ€™s 2020 budget included cuts to Medicare to the tune of $575 billion. As Vox explained, the administration said it would achieve these cost reductions by targeting wasteful spending, provider payments, and lowering prescription drug costs.
This orderâ€™s intent is to promote Medicare Advantage but it has a lot of vague language
Since the 1970s, Americans in Medicare have, through Medicare Advantage, been able to enroll in private health plans â€” both HMOs and PPOs â€” instead of the traditional Medicare program. Currently, roughly a third of Medicare enrollees, or 22 million Americans, are on some kind of private plan. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage has nearly doubled over the last decade and the program has played a significant part in expanding private insuranceâ€™s role in Medicare. The Trump administration is clear that it sees that trajectory positively.
â€œThe executive order commissions us to examine all practices, regulations and guidance to just make sure that we are not steering people into fee-for-service as opposed to giving them a genuine choice of Medicare Advantage or fee-for-service,â€ HHS Secretary Alex Azar told reporters.
Trumpâ€™s executive order calls for federal agencies to ensure that traditional â€œMedicare is not advantaged or promoted over [Medicare Advantage] with respect to its administration.â€ Notably, experts like Neuman argue the problem is really the other way around: Traditional Medicare doesnâ€™t get much attention compared to Medicare Advantage. And itâ€™s not exactly clear how the administration plans to do this.
The order also repeatedly calls for a â€œtransition toward true market-based pricing in the [fee-for-service] Medicare program.â€ In another instance the order calls for â€œMedicare FFS payments to more closely reflect the prices paid for services in [Medicare Advantage] and the commercial insurance market, to encourage more robust price competition, and otherwise to inject market pricing into Medicare FFS reimbursement.â€
These provisions could be particularly consequential. For one, traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage have roughly comparable payment rates whereas commercial insurance pays at a much higher rate. The most extreme interpretation of this proposal would mean that the cost of Medicare would balloon.
â€œAn increase in Medicare payment rates would put an enormous pressure on the Medicare trust fund, which would create a real problem for financing care for future generations. Increasing rates would also increase premiums,â€ Neuman said.
But if matching Medicare and commercial rates is not actually what the administration meant, then the impact would be relatively minimal. There are select services that traditional Medicare pays a higher rate than Medicare Advantage or even a commercial insurance, like the cost of a walker, which could be an opening for savings.
Another provision calls to â€œpreserve the Social Security retirement insurance benefits of seniors who choose not to receive benefits under Medicare Part A.â€ Medicare Part A is an entitlement, as affirmed by a 2012 court decision in which then-DC Circuit Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh ruled that there is â€œno statutory avenue for those who are 65 or older and receiving Social Security benefits to disclaim their legal entitlement to Medicare Part A benefits.â€ It is possible that the administration is trying to open the door to allowing seniors to opt out of Medicare entitlements, which would fundamentally alter the Medicare risk pool.
That said, Medicare Advantage has had its issues. Just last year, federal investigators found the private plans denied claims â€œin an attempt to increase their profits.â€ The government pays the private Medicare Advantage plans a fixed fee per enrollee, whereas traditional Medicare is a pay-by-service system, making heavy users a liability under Medicare Advantage.
Despite this, Advantage plans have been seen as a win-win for many. For seniors, the Advantage plans are allowed to offer more benefits than traditional Medicare does, like hearing, dental, and vision, and the premiums are typically lower than having to buy supplemental coverage for traditional Medicare. Insurers also like it because theyâ€™ve been profitable. This profitability has been managed in part because Advantage plans usually restrict the network of health care providers and have healthier enrollees â€” but they also have been found to engage in some fraudulent practices to inflate the payments from the government, like claiming enrollees are sicker than they actually are.
Proponents for single-payer health care, like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, often point to these instances of misconduct in making a case for essentially eliminating private insurance.
Ironically, the Trump administrationâ€™s argument against single-payer echoes one of Medicare-for-all proponentsâ€™ biggest talking points: that Medicare is super popular.

"The Trump-Ukraine scandal (which still doesnâ€™t have a good name and now encompasses countries other than Ukraine) continued to sprawl over the weekend, with significant new developments on several new fronts, none of which were good for the president.
First off, the initial whistleblower who helped bring this whole saga to public view is no longer alone. At least one more whistleblower, who reportedly was a firsthand witness to events related to Trumpâ€™s Ukraine dealings, has spoken to the intelligence community inspector general and retained legal representation â€” but we donâ€™t yet know what he or she has to say.
Trump has claimed he only called the Ukrainian president on July 25 at Secretary Rick Perryâ€™s urging, who is seen here in Washington, DC on June 25, 2019. Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call
Second, thereâ€™s been increased scrutiny on Secretary of Energy Rick Perryâ€™s role in the scandal â€” particularly because President Donald Trump himself appeared to throw Perry under the bus in a call with Republican lawmakers. According to Axios, Trump said he only had his now-infamous July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president because Perry asked him to.
And finally, what began as an abuse of office scandal now may be sprawling into an old-fashioned financial corruption scandal too: A new Associated Press story revealed that entangled in all this, there is an effort by Trump allies to get rich off natural gas deals in Ukraine.
A second whistleblower has come forward
As you no doubt recall, this whole scandal was kicked off by a whistleblower who filed a complaint about Trumpâ€™s conduct related to Ukraine back in August. We donâ€™t know the personâ€™s identity, but according to the New York Times, he is a male CIA officer.
Since then, a big part of Trumpâ€™s effort to defend himself has involved attacking that whistleblower â€” including by pointing out that his complaint wasnâ€™t based on firsthand information, but rather what he had heard from other government officials.
That was an unconvincing criticism to begin with, because the whistleblowerâ€™s secondhand information has proven to be quite accurate (for instance, the White Houseâ€™s summary of Trumpâ€™s July call with the Ukrainian president quite closely matched the whistleblowerâ€™s description). Additionally, once the complaint was filed, an inspector general interviewed other sources to try and corroborate the allegations, and concluded the complaint was credible.
In any case, though, the wrangling over the initial whistleblower is about to become less important â€” because a second whistleblower, who reportedly has firsthand information, decided to come forward this weekend.
On Friday, the New York Timesâ€™ Michael Schmidt and Adam Goldman reported that a second whistleblower â€” another intelligence official, with â€œmore direct informationâ€ â€” was weighing whether to come forward.
And then, on Sunday, the attorneys for the first whistleblower â€” Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid â€” announced that they were now representing at least one more.
But how many more? Zaid tweeted that the team represents â€œa second whistleblowerâ€ with â€œfirst hand knowledge.â€ That person has not yet filed a formal complaint, but he or she has talked to the inspector general for the intelligence community about the matter.
Bakaj, however, gave a more vague statement, saying that his team now represents â€œmultiple whistleblowersâ€ connected to this event. When the Wall Street Journal asked Zaid for clarification on whether more than one additional whistleblower had come forward, all Zaid said was, â€œThere are definitely multiple whistleblowers.â€
So what we know is that Bakaj and Zaid are now representing at least two whistleblowers. Whether there are actually even more than that â€” or whether their use of â€œmultipleâ€ is just caginess â€” remains to be seen.
Itâ€™s also unclear just what the additional whistleblower has to say, and when Congress or the public will learn what it is. But given how quickly this story has moved so far, it probably wonâ€™t take too long.
Rick Perry suddenly became a key figure
Meanwhile, a Trump administration official was thrown under a metaphorical bus this weekend. The victim was Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who Trump now seems to be suggesting bears some blame for this whole scandal.
On Saturday, Axiosâ€™s Alayna Treene and Jonathan Swan reported that Trump had a conference call with House Republicans on Friday, and repeated his now-standard defense of his call with the Ukrainian president, saying it was â€œperfect.â€ But then Trump went and brought up Perry.
[The president] said something to the effect of: â€œNot a lot of people know this but, I didnâ€™t even want to make the call. The only reason I made the call was because Rick [Perry] asked me to. Something about an LNG [liquefied natural gas] plant,â€ one source said, recalling the presidentâ€™s comments. 2 other sources confirmed the first sourceâ€™s recollection.
...Another source on the call said Trump added that â€œmore of this will be coming out in the next few daysâ€ â€” referring to Perry.
Perry has been hanging around the outskirts of the Ukraine scandal for a few weeks now. But toward the end of last week, news got out that Perry planned to step down from Trumpâ€™s Cabinet before the end of the year.
A long-time Republican political figure, Perry served as governor of Texas for 14 years and ran for president in both the 2012 and 2016 cycles. In that latter campaign, he attacked rival candidate Donald Trump as a â€œcancer on conservatism.â€ But then Trump won, and nominated Perry, a staunch ally of fossil fuel interests, as his energy secretary.
Now, the Energy Departmentâ€™s budget is mainly devoted to maintaining the US nuclear weapons arsenal, cleaning up nuclear waste, and handling basic science research. But, unusually for an energy secretary, Perry has thrown himself into an international dealmaking role. Per Politicoâ€™s Anthony Adragna and Ben Lefebvre, heâ€™s been an â€œaggressive advocate for U.S. energy companies to sell their natural gas to Eastern Europe,â€ and helped strike a gas export deal with Poland and a coal export deal with Ukraine.

Perry was mentioned in the initial whistleblower complaint, albeit briefly. After Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian election in April, Trump ordered Vice President Mike Pence to cancel his planned trip to attend Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration â€” and said Perry should go instead. Perry is also said to have worked closely with State Department officials Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland on Ukraine issues (Volker and Sondland exchanged damning texts about Trumpâ€™s pressure campaign on Ukraine).
Naturally, all this raises questions about whether Perry himself was involved in Trumpâ€™s effort to get Ukraine to investigate his political opponents (as Volker and Sondland were). Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has already sent Perry a letter with several questions. But thatâ€™s not all there is to the Perry story ...
The Associated Press explored whether Trumpâ€™s allies were trying to profit off this Ukrainian caper
Throughout the Ukraine scandal, Trump has professed that all he was trying to do was fight â€œcorruptionâ€ â€” by which he meant, the purported corruption of the Biden family related to a Ukrainian gas company.
Yet it turns out that Trumpâ€™s allies were also trying to get rich from a Ukrainian gas company this year, according to a new story from the Associated Pressâ€™s Desmond Butler, Michael Biesecker, and Richard Lardner.
â€œ[A] circle of businessmen and Republican donors touted connections to Giuliani and Trump while trying to install new management at the top of Ukraineâ€™s massive state gas company [Naftogaz],â€ the AP team writes. â€œTheir plan was to then steer lucrative contracts to companies controlled by Trump allies, according to two people with knowledge of their plans.â€

Perry reportedly played a role in this â€” during his trip to Kyiv to attend Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration in May, he met privately with Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials, and urged them to fire Naftogaz advisory board members. Per the AP, Perry implied that two Texas businessmen would be good choices for for the new board. He also suggested that a current American representative, a former Obama official, be replaced by someone â€œreputable in Republican circles.â€
Meanwhile, allies of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani had similar ideas. As is now well known, Giuliani has been fixated on Ukraine for the past year, and has tried to get the government to launch investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election. And heâ€™s had two questionable characters with him every step of the way: Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.
Parnas and Fruman are both Soviet-born but have since become US citizens. The two entrepreneurs have a history of legal trouble (theyâ€™ve been sued by investors), and gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to a pro-Trump group in 2018. They have lately acted as â€œfixersâ€ of sorts for Giuliani in Ukraine. They may even be paying Giuliani â€” the former New York City mayor described Parnas and Fruman as his â€œclientsâ€ in May.
But what was in it for the fixers? According to this AP report, they were fixated on Naftogaz as well â€” in March, they were trying to push out the companyâ€™s CEO, and they had hatched a plan to export US liquified natural gas to Ukraine as well. Giuliani claims he was never involved in their Ukraine dealings (though he says he was involved in potential Uzbekistan deals). But Parnas and Fruman did eventually manage to make their pitch to Perry.
The full story remains murky, but itâ€™s looking more and more like, in addition to an abuse of office scandal, thereâ€™s an old-fashioned corruption scandal too â€” there was money to be made in Ukraine, and Trumpâ€™s allies wanted to make it.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is expanding the first major piece of legislation sheâ€™d try to pass through Congress if elected president: a vast anti-corruption package to crack down on the entrenched culture of lobbying in Washington, DC.
Warrenâ€™s plan, first released in September, is an update of a bill she released back in August 2018, well before she announced her campaign for president. Sheâ€™s been clear it would be the first major legislative priority of a Warren administration â€” and sheâ€™s been gradually updating it ever since. Warren believes the flow of money in politics has stalled progress on a number of other issues, including gun violence, climate change, and the rising cost of health care. Stamping money out of politics goes to the root of these issues, she says.
â€œThe rich and the powerful have been calling the shots in Washington forever and ever and ever it feels like,â€ Warren told Voxâ€™s Ezra Klein in June. â€œTheyâ€™re not going to just say, â€˜Oh, well, okay. Now you need a wealth tax. Now you want to make these other investments.â€™ ... I think going straight up the middle on the corruption plan is the first one. Knock them back, and while theyâ€™re all scrambling, then start passing the rest of it.â€
In other words, Warrenâ€™s anti-corruption plan is her legislative cornerstone. If elected president, sheâ€™d have plenty of buy-in from the Democratic-controlled House, which passed a similar, sweeping anti-corruption and pro-democracy reform bill known as HR 1 as its first priority after retaking the gavel in 2018. Democrats have a decent chance to retain control of the House in 2020, but flipping the Republican-controlled Senate will be much more difficult.
The main planks of Warrenâ€™s updated anti-corruption plan are similar to the bill she released last year, but there are several major updates, including banning forced arbitration clauses and class action waivers for all employment, consumer protection, antitrust, and civil rights cases. The most recent update tightens ethics rules for judges, and gives judges less leeway to personally decide whether or not they can recuse themselves on certain cases.
â€œOn issue after issue, widely popular policies are stymied because giant corporations and billionaires who donâ€™t want to pay taxes or follow any rules use their money and influence to stand in the way of big, structural change,â€ Warren writes in her plan. â€œWeâ€™ve got to call that out for what it is: corruption, plain and simple.â€
Warrenâ€™s anti-corruption plan, explained
Warrenâ€™s most recent anti-corruption plan contains nearly 100 proposals to change how lobbying works in all three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. Itâ€™s modeled after the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act she introduced last summer but contains some major changes.
Here are the key points of Warrenâ€™s plan:
A lifetime lobbying ban for presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, federal judges, and Cabinet secretaries.
Applying conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, requiring them to place businesses into a blind trust to be sold off. They would also have to place assets that could present a conflict of interest â€” including real estate â€” in a blind trust and sell them off.
Multi-year lobbying bans for federal employees (both congressional staffers and employees of federal agencies). The span of time would be at least two years and six years for those wishing to become corporate lobbyists.
Banning members of Congress and senior congressional staff from serving on corporate boards. The plan would also ban senior administration officials and members of Congress from serving on for-profit boards, no matter if they receive compensation for it or not.
Ban lobbyists from all fundraising activities, including political fundraisers or campaign bundling, and strengthen criminal anti-corruption statutes by redefining an â€œofficial actâ€ to make politicians unable to accept gifts or payments in exchange for government action.
Requiring the IRS to release eight years of tax returns for all presidential and vice-presidential candidates as well as requiring them to release tax returns during each year in office. The IRS would also have to release two years of tax returns for members of Congress, and require them to release tax returns for each lawmakerâ€™s year in office.
Banning members of Congress, Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, White House staff, senior congressional staff, and other officials from owning or trading individual stocks while in office.
Changing the rulemaking process of federal agencies to severely restrict the ability of corporations or industry to delay or influence rulemaking. Warrenâ€™s plan would restrict studies funded by groups with conflict-of-interest problems being considered in the rulemaking process, unless they go under a lengthy peer review.
Broadening the definition of a â€œthing of valueâ€ in campaign finance laws to go beyond money. Under the new definition, it could include opposition research from foreign governments.
Creating a new independent US Office of Public Integrity, which would enforce the nationâ€™s ethics laws and investigate any potential violations. The office would also try to strengthen open records laws, making records more easily accessible to the public and the press.
Banning forced arbitration clauses and class action waivers for all employment, consumer protection, antitrust, and civil rights cases.
Boosting transparency in cases that involve public health or safety, by prohibiting courts from using sealed settlements to conceal evidence.
Prohibiting judges from being able to decide for themselves whether they should recuse themselves from a case due to a conflict. The plan would also require Supreme Court Justices to provide written explanations of recusal decisions when a litigant challenges for recusal.
Beefing up the disciplinary authority of judicial ethics watchdogs, including giving them the power to take away non-vested taxpayer-funded pensions from judges as a penalty for wrongdoing.
Many previous attempts to pass anti-corruption laws have focused on Congress or the executive branch, but Warrenâ€™s plan would up transparency requirements for the judicial branch as well. Sheâ€™d extend the code of conduct for federal judges to those on the US Supreme Court (theyâ€™re currently exempt). Warrenâ€™s plan would also make it so that federal judges under investigation couldnâ€™t escape inquiries by stepping down from their posts.
â€œOur federal court system only works if the American people have faith that it is neutrally dispensing fair-minded justice without bias or personal interests interfering in judicial decisions,â€ Warren said. â€œIf we want the American people to believe this, we need some serious judicial ethics reforms.â€
House Democrats passed a similar plan at the start of the year. Senate Republicans oppose it.
Warren investing her political capital in an anti-corruption plan is a smart move for one big reason: House Democrats passed a similar plan earlier this year and are eager to see it signed into law.
House Democrats made a sweeping anti-corruption bill, known as HR 1, their top priority when they came into power after the 2018 midterms. The main difference between HR 1 and Warrenâ€™s plan is the House Democratsâ€™ bill contains a raft of pro-democracy reforms that would expand voting rights as well as strengthen ethics laws. HR 1 also contained a plan for public campaign finance reform â€” while Warren voices support for that in her anti-corruption proposal, she also says rooting out corruption must be the beginning of structural change.
But if Warren were elected president and House Democrats hung onto their majority in 2020, sheâ€™d have a willing partner to try to get this legislation passed. Of course, the billâ€™s future would depend on whether Democrats could also take back the Senate; current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to be the â€œgrim reaperâ€ of HR 1 as well as a number of other Democratic policy priorities.
Warren may be able to enact some of these changes through executive action. But in order to enact as broad a plan as she envisions â€” one that touches all three branches of government â€” sheâ€™d need buy-in from the House and Senate.
Cracking down on corruption is also a savvy political move; a poll of battleground House Districts by PAC End Citizens United shows House Democratsâ€™ anti-corruption plan is politically popular, and not just among Democratic voters. The poll found an overwhelming number of independent voters â€” 75 percent â€” said cleaning up corruption was a very important issue, the most compared to any other issue polled.
The organizationâ€™s survey found that 75 percent of 2018 voters in battleground House districts said cracking down on Washington corruption was their top priority, followed by 71 percent who wanted to protect Social Security and Medicare, and 70 percent who listed growing the economy and jobs.
Warren started early presenting herself as a candidate free of moneyed influence; she hasnâ€™t participated in high-dollar, closed-door fundraising, choosing to fundraise largely from grassroots donations.
Obviously, she still has to get through a competitive Democratic presidential primary. But if Warren makes it to the general election, sheâ€™ll have a clear contrast between herself and President Donald Trump, a scandal-ridden incumbent who embodies much of the corruption sheâ€™s railing against."
"Joker, a stand-alone origin story for Batmanâ€™s psychotic arch-nemesis, was already one of the most-reviled and most-defended movies of 2019 weeks before its October 3 release. Starring Joaquin Phoenix and directed by the Hangover trilogyâ€™s Todd Phillips, Joker was deemed dangerous by its most vocal critics, akin to an incel training manual. To some of the characterâ€™s and movieâ€™s fans, those critical reviews and negative reactions were just another example of social justice warrior overreach.
Still, the movie garnered plaudits, with largely middling-to-positive reviews, and it won the prestigious Golden Lion, the Venice Film Festivalâ€™s top prize.
Before the movie was released, Jokerâ€™s studio Warner Bros. and family members of those killed in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, mass shooting were in conversation over the possible danger the movie poses to moviegoers. Others worried about the characterâ€™s most toxic fans threatening audiences on opening weekend.
But its opening weekend was relatively calm. The movie broke records, becoming the biggest October opening of all time at $93.5 million. Joker now boasts the fourth biggest opening for an R-rated film in history. And its strong showing suggests more gritty stand-alone movies about comic book villains are likely to loom in the future."
"First Monday is upon us: the first day of the Supreme Courtâ€™s new term. This session will be the second one with the Courtâ€™s current complement of justices, and itâ€™s looking to be a far more politically charged term than the one that ended in June.
After the nasty, will-to-power driven hearings last fall that placed Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, the new justiceâ€™s first term was a bit of an anticlimax. The Court did hear some big cases on lawyerly issues such as administrative law, but the justices seemed to spend much of the term deciding not to decide the sort of high-profile, contentious cases that typically draw headlines.

Last term, the Court side-stepped a case asking whether religious objectors may defy laws prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination. It rather ostentatiously dodged abortion cases, prompting Justice Clarence Thomas to complain that his colleagues turned away a pair of suits because â€œsome respondents in these cases are named â€˜Planned Parenthood.â€™â€ Notably, the biggest case of the term, a gerrymandering case called Rucho v. Common Cause, arose under the Courtâ€™s mandatory jurisdiction â€” meaning that the Court couldnâ€™t refuse to take the case even if it wanted to. (The Court held that federal courts may not decide partisan gerrymandering suits ever again.)
In Kavanaughâ€™s second term, the Court appears much less shy, going by the cases it has agreed to hear. On Friday, the Court announced that it will hear June Medical Services v. Gee, a case that could well be the vehicle the Courtâ€™s conservatives use to gut the right to an abortion. Republicans are likely to win a big prize for their decision to muscle Kavanaugh through his confirmation hearing, a deep cut at abortion rights.
By next June, the Supreme Court also plans to decide whether federal law allows workers to be fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It will likely let the Trump administration start winding down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that allows hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants to live in the United States. It plans to hear the first major Second Amendment case in nearly a decade (although that case may be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction). And looming on the horizon is a potential showdown over Obamacare.
Perhaps the justices simply feel comfortable with their new colleague and are ready to shake things up. Perhaps some feel that the memory of Christine Blasey Fordâ€™s accusation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh has faded enough that the Court can risk shining a spotlight on itself again. Whatever the reason, the Court appears eager to return to Americaâ€™s hottest political and cultural fights. And it will return to them without the relatively moderate conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy around to temper the Courtâ€™s decisions.
Will the right to an abortion survive this term?
The Court will hear June Medical Services v. Gee, a case involving a Louisiana anti-abortion law that is virtually identical to one the Supreme Court struck down in its 2016 decision in Whole Womanâ€™s Health v. Hellerstedt.
Both Gee and Hellerstedt involve a law requiring abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. As the Court explained in Hellerstedt, it is unusually difficult for abortion providers to obtain this credential and the credential itself does little, if anything, to make abortions safer.

Indeed, abortion advocates have a term for the kinds of laws at issue in Hellerstedt and Gee, â€œtargeted restrictions on abortion providers,â€ or â€œTRAPâ€ laws. These are laws that run afoul of a rule the Supreme Court announced in its 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey: â€œunnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.â€
Nevertheless, the Fifth Circuit upheld the Louisiana law in Gee â€” prompting a dissent from Judge Patrick Higginbotham (a Reagan appointee, as it happens), who accused his colleagues of failing â€œto meaningfully apply the undue burden test as articulated in Casey and clarified in Whole Womanâ€™s Health.â€
The biggest open question in Gee is how just how deep the Supreme Court is going to cut into the right to an abortion. It could simply uphold the Louisiana law, while keeping Roe v. Wade nominally on the books. Or it could potentially strike down Roe altogether.
Ultimately, however, the distinction between these two outcomes could be minimal. If the Court allows states to enact TRAP laws, anti-abortion lawmakers are likely to use that new power quite aggressively â€” placing more and more expensive burdens on clinics until it is literally impossible for those clinics to operate.
Is it legal to fire someone for being LGBTQ?
On Tuesday, the second day of the term, the Supreme Court will hear three cases that will determine whether it is legal to fire someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda and Bostock v. Clayton County both involve gay men who allegedly lost their jobs because of their orientation. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC involves a trans woman who was fired by a boss who claims he would be â€œviolating Godâ€™s commandsâ€ if he allowed a trans employee â€œto deny their sex while acting as a representative of [the] organization.â€
These three cases are also the Courtâ€™s first major foray into LGBTQ rights since Kennedyâ€™s retirement. Kennedy often voted with his liberal colleagues on gay rights cases, and he wrote landmark opinions protecting marriage equality and striking down so-called â€œsodomyâ€ laws. So Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes could tell us whether it is possible to assemble a pro-LGBTQ majority in the post-Kennedy Court.
The stakes for LGBTQ workers in these cases are obviously quite significant. But the three cases take on even greater importance because they are ultimately disputes about how courts should behave when they encounter a statute whose explicit language calls for a result that the authors of the statute never would have imagined.
Let me explain. All three cases involve Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans employment discrimination â€œbecause ofâ€ an individualâ€™s â€œrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.â€ And thereâ€™s little doubt that the members of Congress who enacted this law in the mid-1960s did not believe that they were banning discrimination against LGBTQ workers when they did so.
This week, the Supreme Court will hear three cases â€”Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, Bostock v. Clayton County, and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC â€” that will determine whether it is legal to fire someone due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Brendan Smialowsk/AFP/Getty Images
When the Civil Rights Act became law, the queer rights movement was still in its infancy. The Stonewall Uprising was still five years away. One year after the Civil Rights Act became law, activists asking the government to lift a ban on gay federal employees received a response that was so hostile that it is almost unprintable. The federal government did not lift this total ban on hiring gay employees until 1975.
Yet, the Supreme Court has also been very clear that it does not matter what Congress thought Title VII would or would not accomplish when it was enacted; what matters is its expansive language barring all discrimination â€œbecause of ... sex.â€ That language suggests that any workplace discrimination that turns upon the gender of the worker is forbidden.
Take Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998), which involved a man who claimed he was sexually harassed by his male coworkers.
As Justice Antonin Scalia explained for a unanimous Court in Oncale, â€œmale-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was assuredly not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII.â€ Nevertheless, â€œstatutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.â€
Thus, a victim of same-sex harassment could prevail if they can show that concerns about gender drove the harassment. As Scalia explained, â€œIf a female victim is harassed in such sex-specific and derogatory terms by another woman as to make it clear that the harasser is motivated by general hostility to the presence of women in the workplace,â€ Title VII forbids that conduct.
Given this background, Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes should all be easy cases â€” at least as a textual matter. The employers in Zarda and Bostock allegedly fired male employees because those employees are attracted to men. But presumably those employers permit female employees to be attracted to men. So both employers allegedly engaged in sex discrimination by treating male employees different from female employees.
Similarly, the employer in Harris Funeral Homes believes that Aimee Stephens, the plaintiff in that case, is a man. The employer also believes that only people who are assigned the female gender at birth may present as women. Thatâ€™s discrimination â€œbecause of ... sex.â€ The employer treats its employees that it believes to be male different from how it treats employees it believes to be female.
So Zarda, Bostock, and Harris Funeral Homes are not simply landmark LGBTQ rights cases. They are tests of whether several conservative members of the Court who claim to be â€œtextualistsâ€ â€” that is, they claim to believe that the text of the law should always prevail over what its drafters intended to accomplish â€” are willing to hew to their stated principles when the text of a law points in a liberal direction.
Can DACA continue?
Two interlocking mysteries unite a trio of cases â€” Trump v. NAACP, McAleenan v. Vidal, and Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California â€” that concern the fate of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The Court plans to hear these cases on November 12.
The human stakes in these cases are enormous. As of last year, the federal government estimated that over 700,000 undocumented immigrants benefit from the DACA program, which allows many undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to remain in the United States and to work in this country.
Yet the legal issue at the heart of these cases is minuscule. Thereâ€™s no real doubt that the Trump administration may rescind DACA. Indeed, one of the opinions now being reviewed by the Supreme Court states explicitly that the administration â€œindisputably can end the DACA program.â€ And yet, multiple courts blocked the administrationâ€™s attempt to do so, largely due to a glorified paperwork error.

As a general rule, these courts have explained, the judiciary may not review the executive branchâ€™s policy-based decision to wind down DACA. So if the administration were to produce a memo that announces that DACA will end â€” and that also gives one or more policy-based reasons why it should end â€” the courts will not question that memo.
Instead, the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s 2017 memo announcing its intention to wind down DACA rested on a claim that DACA is illegal. And if the administration gives a legal reason to end the program, rather than a policy reason, then the lower courts have concluded that they are allowed to review that legal justification.
All of which is a long way of saying that these are three cases about virtually nothing. The Trump administration could end DACA tomorrow if it chooses to do so. It just has to complete its homework assignment first.
Which brings us back to the two interlocking mysteries at the heart of these cases. The first mystery is why the Trump administration hasnâ€™t just issued a new memo. Itâ€™s possible that the answer is incompetence, but itâ€™s also possible that they havenâ€™t done so because they want the Supreme Court to answer the legal question of whether any president can create a program like DACA.
In 2016, during the brief interregnum after Scaliaâ€™s death when the Supreme Court was down a justice, the Court split 4-4 on whether President Obamaâ€™s efforts to expand DACA and create a similar program known as DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) were legal. Though the Courtâ€™s decision did not explicitly state how each justice voted, the questions at oral argument suggest that the Court split along party lines.
Since then, the Court has only grown more conservative and Republicans regained their majority. That means it is very likely that, should the Court reach the question of whether DACA is legal, there are now five votes to strike the program down and prevent a future president from restoring it.
And that brings us to the second mystery, which is why the Court decided to hear this case in the first place. That is, did the highest Court in the land really decide to take up this case to answer a picayune question about whether the Trump administration filed the correct paperwork? Or does it want to reach the much larger question of whether programs like DACA are allowed to exist at all?
How much will the Courtâ€™s new majority expand the Second Amendment?
Last November, the late Justice John Paul Stevens offered a rare window into the Supreme Courtâ€™s secretive internal deliberations. At Stevensâ€™s urging, the late justice told the New York Timesâ€™ Adam Liptak, Justice Anthony Kennedy asked for several lines to be added to a landmark Second Amendment opinion which limited that opinionâ€™s holding.
That opinion, the 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, was the Supreme Courtâ€™s first decision holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms. Likely due to Kennedyâ€™s intervention â€” Kennedy cast the key fifth vote â€” itâ€™s also heavily caveated. Heller suggests that â€œlongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of armsâ€ all remain valid, as do bans on â€œdangerous and unusual weapons.â€

Kennedy, however, is retired, and his replacement, Kavanaugh, has very different views about guns. As a lower court judge, Kavanaugh wrote a dissent suggesting that banning semi-automatic assault rifles is unconstitutional.
Which brings us to New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York, New York, which the Court is expected to hear in December. New York State Rifle is the first major Second Amendment case to receive a full hearing from the justices in nearly a decade â€” and it is the first such case since Kennedy was replaced by Kavanaugh â€” so it offers the Supreme Court a vehicle to significantly expand the scope of that amendment if it has the votes to do so.
The actual law at issue in New York State Rifle is fairly small potatoes. Until recently, New York City only allowed gun owners with a specific, limited form of gun license to keep a gun inside the home and to shoot it at a list of seven firing ranges. The plaintiffs include gun owners who wish to bring their guns to ranges that are not on this list, and a gun owner with two homes who wishes to be able to transport a gun between them.
Itâ€™s also, well, an ex-law. Shortly after the Supreme Court agreed to hear this case, New York City changed its rules to give the New York State Rifle plaintiff the specific relief that they seek in court, and then the New York state legislature passed a law that effectively prevents the city from reinstating its old rules again.
So thereâ€™s a chance that the Supreme Court will dismiss the case as moot as there is no longer any real controversy between the opposing parties. Even if it does dismiss the case, however, thatâ€™s only likely to delay a reckoning on guns. Eventually the Supreme Court will find a case that is not moot, and that will give the post-Kennedy Court an opportunity to reshape the Second Amendment however it wants.
What does a victim of discrimination need to prove in order to win their case?
The Supreme Courtâ€™s 1989 decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins permitted Title VII plaintiffs to file â€œmixed-motiveâ€ suits, which arise when a worker alleges discrimination based on a mixture of permissible and impermissible factors. Imagine, for example, a situation where two managers reach a joint decision to fire a black worker. If one of those managers was motivated by racism while the other simply believed the worker was underperforming, that could form the basis of a mixed-motive lawsuit by the fired worker.
Mixed-motive suits can shift the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant, who would need to show that the company would have taken the same action against the employee even if bigotry did not weigh into the companyâ€™s decision-making at all.
Two years after Price Waterhouse, Congress enacted a law that explicitly provides for mixed-motive suits in Title VII cases. That law, however, did not extend to many other civil rights laws, and the Roberts Court has generally been hostile to arguments that mixed-motive suits are available in other contexts.
Thus, in Gross v. FBL Financial Services (2009), the Supreme Court held that mixed-motive suits are not allowed under a federal law prohibiting age discrimination. And in University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar (2013), the Court held that mixed-motive suits are not available to plaintiffs who claim their employer retaliated against them because the employee â€œopposed, complained of, or sought remedies for, unlawful workplace discrimination.â€
Comcast Corp. v. National Association of African American-Owned Media, which the Court will hear in November, involves a Reconstruction-era statute that provides that everyone shall enjoy the same contractual rights as are â€œenjoyed by white citizens.â€ The plaintiff in that case is a black-owned media company that claims that Comcast refused to carry its stations for racist reasons. (Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, the parent company of Vox.com.)
The Supreme Court will decide whether mixed-motive suits are available under this post-Civil War discrimination ban. Given the Courtâ€™s decisions in Gross and Nassar, the answer to that question is likely to be â€œno.â€
Indeed, Justice Clarence Thomasâ€™s opinion in Gross â€” a 5-4 decision decided along familiar ideological lines â€” is unusually candid about why the Court reached the decision it did in that case. Responding to the argument that it should treat age discrimination cases the same way it treated Title VII cases in Price Waterhouse, Thomas wrote that â€œit is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach were it to consider the question today in the first instance.â€
The Roberts Courtâ€™s conservative majority, in other words, did not feel that it needed to follow the reasoning of prior precedents handed down by more liberal majorities.
Can federal agents be sued directly when they violate the Constitution?
The facts of HernÃ¡ndez v. Mesa are simply appalling.
The Supreme Court summarized these facts in an earlier iteration of this case: In June of 2010, Sergio HernÃ¡ndez, a 15-year-old Mexican boy, was with his friends on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border. They were playing a game where â€œthey ran up the embankment on the United States side, touched the fence, and then ran back down.â€ Eventually, Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa arrived on the scene, where he allegedly detained one of HernÃ¡ndezâ€™s friends. HernÃ¡ndez, meanwhile, ran away from Mesa and back into Mexican territory.
Agent Mesa allegedly then fired two shots across the border at HernÃ¡ndez. One of those shots â€œstruck HernÃ¡ndez in the face and killed him.â€
The United States, for its part, claims that Mesa fired his gun after â€œsmugglers attempting an illegal border crossing hurled rocks from close range at a [Customs and Border Patrol] agent who was attempting to detain a suspect.â€ The plaintiffs claim that â€œHernÃ¡ndez was unarmed and unthreatening at the time.â€
The specific issue before the Court concerns whether Mesa, the border agent, should be personally liable to HernÃ¡ndezâ€™s survivors under a 1971 Supreme Court decision called Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.

â€œAn agent acting â€” albeit unconstitutionally â€” in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own,â€ Justice William Brennan explained for the Court in Bivens, and so the federal courts should remedy such harms by allowing people injured by a federal agentâ€™s unconstitutional actions to sue the agent directly.
Subsequent decades have not been kind to Bivens, however. According to a federal appeals court decision denying relief to HernÃ¡ndezâ€™s family, â€œBivens claims are now a distinctly â€˜disfavoredâ€™ remedy and are subject to strict limitations.â€
â€œThe threat of Bivens liability could undermine the Border Patrolâ€™s ability to perform duties essential to national security,â€ Judge Edith Jones of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit argued in that lower court decision, adding that â€œimplying a private right of action for damages in this transnational context increases the likelihood that Border Patrol agents will â€˜hesitate in making split second decisions.â€™â€
Ultimately, in other words, HernÃ¡ndez comes down to a values judgment. Will a majority of the Supreme Court agree with Justice Brennan that the awesome power given to federal agents calls for consequences if they abuse that power? Or will it agree with Judge Jones that federal agents should not hesitate to make â€œsplit second decisions,â€ even in confusing situations where the life of a child is on the line? A decision adopting Jonesâ€™s moral calculus, moreover, could have profound implications for other constitutional violations by federal agents â€” including suits against ICE agents who violate the rights of immigrants.
Will the courts repeal Obamacare in its entirety?
Finally, there is a decent likelihood that the Supreme Court will have to hear the latest case seeking to repeal the Affordable Care Act before this term is up.
The legal theory underlying Texas v. United States is widely viewed as ridiculous, even by many conservative legal scholars who spent the better part of the last decade trying to convince federal courts to weaken or abolish Obamacare. As originally enacted, the Affordable Care Actâ€™s â€œindividual mandateâ€ requires most Americans to either carry health insurance or pay higher taxes. A 2017 amendment to the law effectively repealed the mandate by reducing the amount of this tax to zero dollars.

The plaintiffs argue that the zeroed-out mandate is now unconstitutional and that the proper remedy for the fact that Obamacare now contains an unconstitutional provision that literally does nothing is to toss out the entirety of the law. As two Republican state attorneys general quipped in a brief opposing this argument, â€œto describe the [plaintiffsâ€™] approach is to refute it.â€
Nevertheless, at oral arguments last July, a panel dominated by two Republican appointees to the Fifth Circuit appeared determined to strike down the law. Should they follow through, the Supreme Court will almost certainly take up the case â€” and depending on when the Fifth Circuit hands down its decision, the justices could do so as soon as this term.
Thus, the brief period when the Supreme Court seemed to shy away from the most contentious issues appears likely to come to a close this term. And the Court could potentially thrust itself into massive controversies involving LGBTQ rights, immigration, guns, abortion, and Obamacare just in time for the 2020 presidential election to heat up.

"In August, it was SoulCycle and Equinox. The month prior, Home Depot. Back in 2017, L.L.Bean. These are only a few of the companies to ignite the collective ire of progressive consumers over corporate ties to Trump. In the case of the boutique fitness studios, it was a Trump fundraiser hosted by their majority stake investor Stephen M. Ross; with the home improvement chain, it was co-founder Bernie Marcusâ€™s promise to donate to Trumpâ€™s 2020 reelection campaign; with the duck boot and outdoor apparel brand, it was Bean descendant and board member Linda Lorraine Beanâ€™s $60,000 donation to Trump super PAC Making America Great Again, LLC (itself a violation of the Federal Election Commissionâ€™s permitted donor limit of $5,000).
For Americans opposed to Trumpâ€™s policies â€” from the inhumane treatment and targeting of detained migrants, to detrimental inaction on climate change, to refusal to regulate guns in the wake of unprecedented mass shootings â€” shopping at retailers connected to the celebrity-entrepreneur-turned-sitting-president is tantamount to hypocrisy.
â€œThe goal came originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscienceâ€
Calls to boycott Trump-tainted brands stretch back to the #GrabYourWallet movement that began in the wake of the 2016 election. Organizers Shannon Coulter and Sue Atencio turned outrage into action with a spreadsheet of companies linked to Trump or the Trump family, both explicitly (Trump owned) and implicitly (Trump funders, Trump brand sellers), detailing why those companies are on the list and what they need to do to get off it. â€œThe goal,â€ Coulter told the New York Times, â€œcame originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience.â€
Of course, boycott calls are not unique to Trumpâ€™s critics; Trump himself is an avid boycotter, and his MAGA fans follow suit. Nor are boycott calls unique in the Trump era. Consumers have long registered their disapproval of businessesâ€™ practices by refusing to shop them and calling on others to do the same, dating back to this countryâ€™s birth (and further back elsewhere in the world, like in ancient Greece and early Christianity, in the form of organized ostracism).
What do you get when consumers takes action? Consumer activism. And by the inverse action, consumers are shopping alternative products and companies that complement their worldview more now than ever before â€” particularly when it comes to combating climate change. Sustainability-tinged consumer activism is a new flavor of an old tactic, one that falls under the umbrella of what we now call conscious consumerism.
Consumer activism can take the shape of two diametrically opposed actions â€” buying en masse and boycotting en masse â€” that are after the same goal
â€œ[Consumer activism is] either grassroots collective organization of consumption or its withdrawal,â€ explains Lawrence Glickman, an American historian at Cornell University and author of Buying Power: A History of Consumer Activism.
Meaning, itâ€™s â€œBuy Nike!â€ to express support of Colin Kaepernickâ€™s 2018 pick as brand ambassador following his kneeled protest against police brutality targeting people of color and his collusion lawsuit against the NFL. Itâ€™s also, â€œBoycott Nike!â€ and even, â€œ#BurnYourNikes!â€ to express outrage over â€œwhen somebody disrespects our flag,â€ as Trump put it in 2017, supposedly provoked by Kaepernickâ€™s peaceful demonstration.

Calls to boycott, though, are a heck of a lot more visible on social media than are rally cries to pledge brand support. Glickman writes in Buying Power that two-thirds of Americans take part in at least one boycott a year.
Boycotts stem from anger. Anger spreads faster and farther on social media than any other emotion, as uncovered by computer scientists at Chinaâ€™s Beihang University and reported by MIT Technology Review. And there are many, many ongoing and overlapping boycotts at any given time. AP News even has a feed to track boycotts worldwide.
Consumer activism, boycotts included, puts power in the hands of the people â€” â€or at least they think it is,â€ adds Glickman.
We boycotted before there was even a word for it
â€œBoycotts are as American as apple pie,â€ #GrabYourWallet co-founder and digital strategist Coulter told Fast Company in 2017, referring to the Boston Tea Partyâ€™s 1773 dump of British imports that precipitated the American Revolutionary War. Colonists had boycotted British tea for several years by then; â€œNo taxation without representation,â€ they demanded. Refusing to purchase British tea was a pointed way to voice their mounting resentment of their decidedly un-independent status. Short of revolt, it was the only power they had â€” until, of course, they revolted.
Glickman dates the boycott much further back: to ancient Greece. Expedition Magazine cites the city of Athensâ€™ historic boycott of the Olympic Games in 332 BCE as a key turning point. The city had incurred a massive fine after its endorsed athlete attempted, and failed, to fix a match, and refused to attend the games in protest unless the charges were dropped. (They werenâ€™t, and Athens eventually relented.)
Boycotts are employed the world over, and not all of them are about consumerism
The term â€œboycottâ€ didnâ€™t emerge, however, until 1880, in Ireland. Captain Charles Boycott was a British land agent in County Mayo â€” and â€œthe man who became a verb!â€ â€” whose evictions â€œwere many and bloody,â€ as described by IrishCentral. After Boycott attempted to evict another 11 tenants, the Land League (an Irish political organization of the 1800s that rallied in aid of poor farmworkers) convinced Boycottâ€™s employees to walk out and compelled the community to, essentially, ice him out. Shops and the like refused to do business with him, the post stopped his mail. He left Ireland humiliated.
Boycotts are employed the world over, and not all of them are about consumerism. Just last month, tens of thousands of students in Hong Kong boycotted the first day of school as part of ongoing protests over an extradition bill that could send Hong Kong citizens to China, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for a boycott of the Israeli TV channel that co-produced the HBO show Our Boys, and Swedenâ€™s top female hockey players are boycotting the national team over unfair pay and poor working conditions.
Still, there is a certain Americanness to the ubiquity of the boycott today. Take #GrabYourWallet, which at present calls for boycotts of 31 different companies (not including subsidiaries or partners), five over their Stephen M. Ross connections. Says Glickman, Americans â€œdidnâ€™t invent [the boycott], but the frequency with which we use it is somewhat exceptional.â€
Consumer activism in 2019 is not a whole lot different from consumer activism in the 1840s â€” except when it comes to the causes
â€œA lot of people think that what weâ€™re seeing now is new,â€ says Glickman. â€œBut there are a lot of parallels with history.â€ Particularly, Americaâ€™s history of slavery and abolitionism.
The Free Produce Movement, led by Quaker abolitionists in the 1840s through the Civil War, hinged on boycotting goods made by enslaved people, cotton key among them. Buying these products, as far as Free Produce stalwarts were concerned, was analogous to supporting slavery outright.
The issues are different today, but the strategy remains the same: Vote with your dollar and donâ€™t contribute a cent to the bottom line of companies whose values donâ€™t align with your own. Says Glickman, â€œThat fundamental question of, â€˜No one stands outside of moral problems, that weâ€™re all implicated in [them]â€™ â€” thatâ€™s the essence of consumer activism.â€
â€œâ€˜No one stands outside of moral problems, that weâ€™re all implicated in [them]â€™ â€” thatâ€™s the essence of consumer activismâ€
Voting with your dollar doesnâ€™t just mean not spending your dollars in problematic places (i.e. Amazon, Wayfair, etc.); it also means supporting companies that practice what they preach, both by way of their company culture and by what they sell. Conscious consumerism drives at that very point, particularly when it comes to â€œvotingâ€ for sustainability and humane working conditions.
Says the Nationâ€™s Willy Blackmore of the boycottâ€™s antebellum lineage, where abolitionists bought wool over cotton and maple sugar over cane:
The same thinkingâ€”that itâ€™s better to buy products that we believe are made without exceptional sufferingâ€”animates some contemporary conscious consumerism. The desire to minimize the harm we cause as consumers has led to a variety of fluffy marketing terms as well as third-party verification organizations, so you can buy everything from cruelty-free makeup to Fair Trade food products.
Conscious consumerism (alternatively called ethical consumption) is todayâ€™s catchall to cover consumer dollars invested in a host of progressive values: worker rights, animal rights, low-carbon footprint, recycled and/or renewable materials, organic, local, etc. â€” your fair-trade fashion, your greenhouse-gas-cutting Ikea, your metal straw. Itâ€™s a term thatâ€™s caught on in the last 10 years, but it was not only predated by the green consumerism of the 1990s, itâ€™s also the driving argument behind all consumer activism from the tea-in-the-harbor get-go.
What is newish, however, is the phenomenon of sustainable shopping and widespread availability of ethically made, eco-friendly goods â€” where consumers concerned about climate change, for instance, â€œlive their valuesâ€ vis a vis their plastic-free purchases.
â€œItâ€™s hard to pinpoint exactly when we saw consumers trying to make positive environmental change in their shopping,â€ says Emily Huddart Kennedy, University of British Columbia sociologist and author of Putting Sustainability into Practice: Applications and Advances in Research on Sustainable Consumption. Data analytics company Nielsen called 2018 â€œThe Year of the Influential Sustainable Consumer,â€ adding that â€œitâ€™s soon to be the decade of the sustainable shopper.â€ Sustainable product sales reached $128.5 billion in 2018, up 20 percent from four years prior; Nielsen projects 2021 to cash in on $150 billion worth of sustainability sales.
There are several theories, says Kennedy, on what caused the shift, including mistrust in government to adequately address climate change and the growing â€œsense of doing something in the face of these huge sustainability crises,â€ as she puts it. Kennedyâ€™s research has shown that conscious consumerismâ€™s popularity can also be tied to its elite nature â€” in part because of high price tags, in part because of championing among celebrities, in part because of its en vogueiness, â€œitâ€™s seen as a â€˜high-classâ€™ thing to do.â€
Consuming consciously is aspirational, both for individuals and for the planet. University of Toronto sociologist JosÃ©e Johnston, a colleague of Kennedyâ€™s, found that nearly two-thirds of consumers resonated with the statement, â€œshopping is a powerful force for social and environmental change.â€ Elaborates Johnstonâ€™s survey report in the Journal of Marketing Management, â€œThis suggests that the majority of the shopping public believe that their shopping dollars can promote a social and environmental alternative to the status quo.â€
Consumer activism, for all its prevalence, might be an unintentional misdirect, say critics
Activists for any one particular cause are in no way united that consumer activism is the most effective way â€” or even an effective way â€” to enact change. The main criticism is that individual product swaps do nothing to impact legislation and corporate responsibility.
Thatâ€™s not a new argument; many abolitionists disagreed with their Free Produce Movement cohorts. As Glickman writes in Buying Power, â€œCritics accused free produce activists of overvaluing private rectitude to the point where it had little connection with the public good.â€ Maybe wearing wool and eating maple makes you abolitionists feel better, Free Produce critics seemed to say, but it does squat to end slavery.
Twenty-first century shoppers face, in spirit, the same conundrum.
â€œConscious consumerism is a lie,â€ writes sustainable fashion expert and frequent Vox contributor Alden Wicker for Quartz, quoting a speech she delivered at the 2017 UN Youth Delegation. â€œSmall steps taken by thoughtful consumers â€” to recycle, to eat locally, to buy a blouse made of organic cotton instead of polyester â€” will not change the world.â€ Instead, she argues, conscious consumerism is an expensive distraction from the real work at hand.

Sure, vote with your dollar, the criticism stands â€” but you do a whole lot more by simply voting for politicians who give a damn that the Earth is melting. Only 46.1 percent of voters aged 18-29 voted at all in 2016, 55 percent of which voted Democrat. Nielsen found that 90 percent of millennials (aged 21-34) are willing to pay more for eco-friendly and sustainable products. These stats donâ€™t necessarily provide a one-for-one since thereâ€™s a gap in the age categorizations, but if the entirety of that 90 percent of conscious consumer millennials had gone to the polls and voted how their dollar votes ... We donâ€™t have to spell it out, right?
With more opportunities to be a conscious consumer â€” thanks to more and more â€œleading brands that compete to see who is greener,â€ as Joel Makower, author of 1990â€™s The Green Consumer, writes for GreenBiz â€” so too do opportunities for economic existential angst mount. Ditching plastic straws, in the grand scheme of things, will do diddly for the planet, representing less than 1 percent of our sweeping plastic problem.
And as such, conscious consumerism can deliver unearned complacency, house-on-fire calm akin to â€œThis Is Fineâ€ dog. As Jim Leape, co-director of the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions told Stanford Report, â€œThe risk is that banning straws may confer â€˜moral licenseâ€™ â€” allowing companies and their customers to feel they have done their part. The crucial challenge is to ensure that these bans are just a first step.â€
Sen. Elizabeth Warren homed in on this very point during CNNâ€™s recent climate change forum, following a series of questions to Democratic candidates on regulating lightbulbs, banning plastic straws, and encouraging people to cut down on red meat, as reported by Voxâ€™s Li Zhou:
â€œOh, come on, give me a break,â€ Warren said in response to the lightbulb question, in one of the breakout moments of the night. â€œThis is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about. ... They want to be able to stir up a lot of controversy around your lightbulbs, around your straws, and around your cheeseburgers, when 70 percent of the pollution, of the carbon that weâ€™re throwing into the air, comes from three industries.â€
Thereâ€™s an added tension when it comes to green shopping and movements like Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement, that conscious consumerismâ€™s prescribed solution is antithetical to sustainabilityâ€™s aims.
â€œThe idea of â€˜shoppingâ€™ your way to sustainability is fundamentally flawed,â€ says sociologist Kennedy. â€œThat is, if we need to slow down growth to protect the environment, then we canâ€™t rely on â€˜betterâ€™ consumption â€” we also have to reduce consumption.â€ To her point, climate activist Greta Thunbergâ€™s speech at the UNâ€™s Climate Action Summit on September 23 addressed world leaders but zeroed in on an oft-repeated delusion that cutting emissions by 50 percent in 10 years will do the trick. â€œWe are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.â€
There are alternative ways that consumers can â€œdo somethingâ€ impactful with their money, writes Wicker in Quartz: Donating to activist organizations and donating to politicians who vow to vote for green initiatives (i.e. passing a Green New Deal) and holding big corporate offenders accountable are good places to start.
Okay, okay, but does consumer activism do â€¦ anything?
In a word: sometimes! In more words, whether or not consumer activism and conscious consumerism â€œworkâ€ depends, really, on the definition of success.
Historian Glickman likes to differentiate between short-term and long-term goals. Sociologist Kennedy separates material benefits from ideological gains.
â€œOftentimes the boycott starts with a great deal of enthusiasm and ends with a whimperâ€
â€œAlmost every boycott fails to achieve its punitive goal,â€ says Glickman. The Montgomery Bus Boycott, he adds, is a rare example of an â€œunambiguous victory,â€ where the boycott attained its demands: hiring black drivers, promising respectful drivers, and first-come first-seated policy. The SoulCycle boycott is another: Last monthâ€™s consumer activism over Rossâ€™s Trump fundraiser did in fact dent SoulCycleâ€™s attendance. But these are notable exceptions (the former inarguably more impactful than the latter) to the rule.
Adds Glickman, â€œA lot of times boycotts of big corporations donâ€™t really affect the bottom line of that corporation. Oftentimes the boycott starts with a great deal of enthusiasm and ends with a whimper.â€ For instance, Amazon: Despite calls year after year to boycott Amazon Prime Day over factory conditions (and this year over contracts with ICE), the retail behemoth repeatedly manages to smash its sales record.
In terms of the material benefit of product swaps, â€œthe jury is out,â€ says Kennedy. Yes, phosphate-free dish detergent can curb water pollution, she says; but Kennedyâ€™s research shows that conscious consumers often maintain very large carbon footprints themselves. â€œConscious consumers tend to be well-educated,â€ explains Kennedy, â€œand well-educated people typically earn a good income,â€ income that buys them nice cars and tickets on commercial planes and air conditioning units and so on.
â€œThe ideological benefits are not much more conclusive, unfortunately,â€ adds Kennedy. â€œI think itâ€™s fair to say that conscious consumption has made more people think about the resources that go into the stuff we buy and about what happens to our stuff when we throw it away.â€ This, in effect, is consumer activismâ€™s long-term goal, what historian Glickman calls â€œa transformation of consciousness.â€ On the other hand, Kennedy says, â€œWhen people obsess about the environmental impact of their goods, that can let companies and governments off the hook. So itâ€™s a mixed bag.â€
Where and how we spend our money does matter. But how much it matters depends on what else we do with our money and what governments and corporations do with their (considerably larger) pots. At best, the rising popularity of conscious consumerism, for instance, suggests that the buying public will at least spend their way to a healthier world; the big problem, though, is that individual monetary action â€” even when performed collectively â€” is only the beginning.
â€œI canâ€™t imagine that the world is worse off because of conscious consumerism,â€ says Kennedy, â€œbut I doubt it will be enough to save the planet.â€

"Believe it or not, the Ukraine scandal embroiling President Donald Trump in an impeachment crisis is somehow only growing â€” and getting more damning for the White House by the hour.
On Thursday morning, the president once again encouraged Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election and then thought it would be a good idea to bring China into the mix.
â€œChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,â€ Trump told reporters outside the White House. â€œBecause what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.â€
Then things heated up later that evening.
CNN reported that Trump raised former Vice President Joe Bidenâ€™s and Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s political prospects on a June call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump also told the Chinese leader heâ€™d stay quiet about the protests in Hong Kong, which China is very sensitive about, while the US and China continue trade talks.
The Wall Street Journal also reported Thursday evening that the real reason Trump recalled the US ambassador to Ukraine earlier this year was because his allies told him she wasnâ€™t a fan of his and wasnâ€™t particularly enthused about a probe into the Bidens. That corroborates claims in the whistleblower complaint and contradicts the governmentâ€™s official reasoning for her return stateside.
Thatâ€™s not all: After a 10-hour deposition of Kurt Volker, who just resigned as the top US envoy for Ukraine over the scandal, House Democrats released a select batch of text messages showing State Department diplomats working with Trumpâ€™s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to compel Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in exchange for much-needed military aid.
Thatâ€™s the exact â€œquid pro quoâ€ Trump and his allies have been arguing the administration didnâ€™t do.
And Friday morning, Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor generalâ€™s office announced it would reopen an investigation into the former chief of Burisma Holdings, the gas company on whose board Hunter Biden, Joeâ€™s son, sat.
This scandal is moving fast, and the news along with it. So if you havenâ€™t been able to keep up because you want to live your normal, non-impeach-y life, donâ€™t worry: Weâ€™ve got you covered.
Hereâ€™s a brief rundown of the big Ukraine scandal news that broke in the last 24 hours.
Trump encouraged two countries to interfere in the 2020 election â€” on camera
You might remember that during the 2016 presidential election, then-candidate Trump said the following at a July event: â€œRussia, if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing ... I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.â€
That comment, in part, led to claims that Trump was openly encouraging a foreign country to harm a political opponent for his benefit. Trump says it was a joke, of course, and that he would never, ever do something like that.
Then this Thursday, he did something like that.

A reporter asked Trump what exactly heâ€™d wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do after their now-infamous July 25 phone call. Hereâ€™s his response, which was captured on camera:
I would think that if they were honest about it, theyâ€™d start a major investigation into the Bidens. Itâ€™s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens ... and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens. Because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.
The Ukraine stuff alone here is bad for Trump. But the China comment takes it to a whole new level.
Itâ€™s a reference to Trumpâ€™s false belief that Hunter Biden made billions from Chinese interests after going on a 2013 trip to the country with his father, who was vice president at the time. Itâ€™s a theory that has its origins in the conservative press fever swamp but one that Trump seems to believe pretty firmly.
The theory goes that Hunter got rich because he sat on the board of BHR Equity Investment Fund Management, a Shanghai-based private-equity firm that aimed to raise $1.5 billion in 2014. A conservative writer, Peter Schweizer, cited that number in his 2018 book on American political families and ties to China. The truth, though, is that Hunter bought 10 percent of the firm in 2017 â€” after Joe Biden left the vice presidency â€” giving him the equivalent of $420,000. Trump also believes Joe has made money from China, but itâ€™s unclear exactly how.
A reporter then asked the president whether heâ€™d made a private request to Chinese President Xi Jinping to open an investigation into the Bidens the way he did with Zelensky.
Trump responded: â€œItâ€™s certainly something we can start thinking about, because Iâ€™m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars [are] taken out of his country.â€
Letâ€™s be 100 percent clear what happened here: While under an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives over allegations he asked Ukraine to try to dig up dirt on his 2020 political opponent, the president of the United States â€” publicly, on camera, in front of a gaggle of reporters â€” called on both Ukraine and China (arguably Americaâ€™s largest geopolitical rival) to try to dig up dirt on his 2020 political opponent.
You just canâ€™t make this stuff up.
CNN reports that Trump and Xi spoke about Joe Biden in June, too (!)
It seems Trump just canâ€™t stop talking about his political prospects while on the phone with foreign leaders.
CNN reported Thursday that, according to two people familiar with Trump and Xiâ€™s June 18 conversation, the two leaders talked about both Bidenâ€™s and Warrenâ€™s political fortunes â€” which makes sense since they are both leading 2020 Democratic candidates.
When CNN reached out to the White House to confirm their reporting that Trump discussed Biden with Xi on that June 18 call, the White House didnâ€™t deny it:
â€œWorld leaders need to be able to speak freely in their conversations with the President â€” that is a key component to effective diplomacy. And that is why such conversations are kept confidential,â€ White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. â€œWe are not going to start discussing the contents of every conversation President Trump has with world leaders, other than to say his conversations are always appropriate.â€

Trump reportedly also used the call to reiterate that he wouldnâ€™t raise the issue of Chinaâ€™s approach toward the months-long pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong as long as the US and China remained engaged in trade negotiations.
That backs a Financial Times report from July that the administration pressured the outgoing US consul general to Hong Kong, Kurt Tong, not to mention Chinaâ€™s policy toward the city in his farewell speech after Trump agreed to tone down Hong Kong criticism.
Xi continues to use the trade talks to get what he wants from the American president. First, he asked that the US stay quiet on China putting more than a million Uighur Muslims in reeducation camps. Then he pushed for Trump to reverse the ban on US businesses working with Chinese telecommunications giants Huawei and ZTE â€” even though Trumpâ€™s own administration says doing that is a national security risk.
And now this.
So is Xi just playing Trump? Maybe. But these latest revelations suggest Trump may also be trying to play China, suggesting he wonâ€™t sign a trade deal unless Xi agrees to look into the Bidens.
Consider what Trump said on Thursday, just 30 seconds before he mentioned China should investigate his top political opponent:
Chinaâ€™s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday responded to Trumpâ€™s remarks, saying, â€œChina will not interfere in the internal affairs of the US, and we trust that the American people will be able to sort out their own problems.â€
Thatâ€™s all well and good, but China did take out a four-page supplement in an Iowa newspaper last year to sway voters away from Trump. So perhaps Beijing isnâ€™t above meddling in US elections after all.
Trump forced out the US ambassador to Ukraine because she wasnâ€™t thrilled about his quest to destroy Biden
Back in May, US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch was recalled from her post â€” two months before she was scheduled to end her assignment. At the time, it wasnâ€™t exactly clear why.
But the whistleblower complaint that became public last month alleges that Yovanovitch was recalled to Washington because she didnâ€™t subscribe to Trumpâ€™s and Giulianiâ€™s attempts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
It turns out the whistleblower was right, but thereâ€™s even more to the story.
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump ordered Yovanovitch removed after hearing months of complaints from people close to him but not in government, particularly Giuliani. That led the State Department â€” which runs US embassies â€” to relocate the longtime diplomat in part because it was a priority for Trump to do so and that she couldnâ€™t be protected from constant attacks by the presidentâ€™s allies.
Giuliani told the Journal that he reminded Trump that Yovanovitch had demonstrated an anti-Trump bias and was apparently an â€œobstacleâ€ â€” the newspaperâ€™s words, not Giulianiâ€™s â€” to efforts to kickstart a Ukrainian probe into the Bidens.
This goes against the official explanation for why the ambassador came home, which was that her return was â€œplanned.â€ But now we know she left Kyiv solely because the president wanted her gone, and a main reason why was that she wasnâ€™t gung-ho about a politically motivated investigation.
If that doesnâ€™t scream â€œabuse of power,â€ nothing does. But that wasnâ€™t even the worst news for the president on Thursday.

Text messages show the administrationâ€™s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens
If youâ€™re Trump, probably the last thing you want is for there to be direct evidence showing people in your employ working to get Ukraine to look into Joe and Hunter Biden.
Well, we regret to inform you, Mr. President, but to steal a famous line from former FBI Director James Comey: â€œLordy, there are texts.â€
House Democrats on Thursday interviewed Kurt Volker â€” who until last week ran point on US-Ukraine policy for the State Department â€” for hours behind closed doors about his involvement in the effort to pressure Ukraine to look into the Bidens.
Later that night, they released a batch of texts that Volker had handed over. What they show, according to my colleague Andrew Prokop, is â€œdamningâ€:
They reveal that top State Department diplomats worked with the presidentâ€™s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to try to get Ukraine to commit to politicized investigations demanded by President Trump into the gas company Hunter Biden served on the board of â€” Burisma â€” as well as into Ukraineâ€™s role in the 2016 election...
The texts reveal that the pressure campaign was presented this July as a quid pro quo â€” if Ukraine committed to these investigations, the US would agree to a White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky. For weeks, these State officials tried to get Zelensky to publicly announce he was conducting these investigations, in exchange for the meeting â€” but Zelensky apparently refused.
I advise you to read Prokopâ€™s piece for a fuller explanation of the texts, but thatâ€™s basically the gist of what happened.
Hereâ€™s a screenshot of one of the text message conversations that took place between August and September in which Volker and Andrey Yermak, a top Ukrainian official, discuss the possibility of having Zelensky announce the opening of a probe into the Bidens:
This looks really, really bad for the administration, despite Republican protestations that the texts were â€œcherry-pickedâ€ by Democrats. Itâ€™s yet another piece of clear evidence that Trump administration officials and private citizens close to Trump tried to establish a quid pro quo with Ukraine â€” and more may come out in the future.
Ukraine will restart its investigation into Burisma, which could mean investigating the Bidens
Trumpâ€™s core argument against Joe Biden is that when he was vice president, he improperly used the power of his office to get a Ukrainian general prosecutor fired in order to stop him from investigating the owner of Burisma, the company where Bidenâ€™s son Hunter served on the board.
The reality is that the Obama administration â€” as well as many other Western European officials â€” wanted the prosecutor, a man named Viktor Shokin, removed because he was believed to be trying to stymie anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. In other words, if anything, Bidenâ€™s efforts could have put his son in more legal jeopardy, not less.
As of Friday, it appears that investigation is coming back. The Wall Street Journal reports that Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor generalâ€™s office has said it now intends to reopen the investigation into Burismaâ€™s owner.
Ruslan Ryaboshapka, the prosecutor general, said the probe reopening is more of an audit of past investigations and is not in response to Trumpâ€™s requests. â€œNo foreign or domestic politicians, officials and non-officials, called me or tried to influence my decision regarding specific criminal proceedings,â€ Ryaboshapka said.
Thatâ€™s somewhat hard to believe, as Kyiv is certainly aware of how important this is to the Trump administration. Itâ€™s possible, though, that this move allows Zelenskyâ€™s government to legitimately look at poorly investigated past cases while appearing to fulfill Trumpâ€™s request.
Trump, as heâ€™s wont to do, denied any wrongdoing on Twitter Friday morning.
But the fact that there is even an appearance of Ukraine kowtowing to Trump shows just how politically treacherous this entire situation has become for the president.

"The Trump administration just made it harder for laid-off workers to get government assistance.
The Department of Labor published a new rule Friday that will allow states to expand the number of people who have to pass drug tests to get unemployment benefits. Jobless workers who fail the test would be blocked from getting the assistance, which employers pay for through payroll taxes â€” money that most workers are entitled to receive when they are fired.
The move is a dramatic reversal from the Obama administration, which in 2016 placed strict limits on drug testing for unemployment claims. States could only deny benefits to workers in a few high-risk jobs (like law enforcement and childcare) or to employees who were fired because they tested positive for drugs.
Republicans revoked the Obama-era rule soon after Trump took office, and now the Trump administration is moving in the opposite direction. The latest rule would let states test all laid-off employees who work for companies that normally require job applicants to pass drug tests. That includes testing for marijuana, opioids, or any other class of illegal (and in some states, legal) substances.
Workersâ€™ rights advocates called the rule â€œinvasiveâ€ and â€œunconstitutional.â€
â€œThis final rule represents a not-so-subtle attack on the character of unemployed Americans,â€ Michele Evermore, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, wrote in a statement to Vox. â€œDrug testing is simply a lazy way of blaming the victims of larger economic trends or corporate practices such as downsizing, outsourcing, and offshoring.â€
The rule is harsh. It would deny government help to a much larger group of workers who just lost their main source of income. It also gives employers an incentive to start requiring drug tests at work, since unemployment insurance costs are lower if workers are more likely to be denied benefits.
Itâ€™s also unnecessary: The number of people filing for unemployment is at a record low right now, so itâ€™s hard to view this as anything other than a giveaway to big businesses and the massive drug-testing industry.
The new rule also sets up a potential legal battle with civil rights groups, which have warned the Trump administration that such a move could be illegal as it would hurt poor, low-skilled workers the most.
â€œLimiting access to historically deprived communities is egregious and borderline discriminatory,â€ Caryn York, executive director of the Job Opportunities Task Force, wrote in a letter to the Department of Labor. Her organization is one of dozens of nonprofit groups that have opposed the rule since it was first proposed in November.
Unemployment benefits are a critical part of the safety net
Unemployment insurance benefits and rules vary by state, but most workers who lose their jobs are entitled to a fraction of their regular pay for up to 26 weeks. It usually takes two to three weeks for workers to get their first unemployment check, but it helps people pay their bills while they search for another job.
Employers pay the cost of unemployment insurance, usually through a 6 percent payroll tax, which can increase depending on how many employees a company lays off.
The Trump administration claims that its new rule is about statesâ€™ rights. When the Department of Labor proposed the rule in November, the agency said it was about â€œrespecting the breadth and diversity of individual state economies.â€ It made no mention of the impact such a rule would have on workers.
The rule is essentially a broad interpretation of a 2012 law that lets states deny benefits to workers fired from jobs that regularly conduct drug testing. The Obama administration limited the number of jobs that fit into this category; now Trump is expanding it.
And civil rights groups are pissed.
Lawyers say the rule is unconstitutional
The rule is quite unpopular, based on the 211 public comments submitted in response to the proposal back in November.
A long list of civil rights and workersâ€™ rights groups publicly trashed the rule and questioned its legality: the NAACP, the North Carolina Justice Center, and the Michigan Poverty Law Program, just to name a few. Many argued that it amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.
â€œA blanket license for governmental intrusion into the privacy of average Americans who just happen to be unlucky enough to lose their job seems rooted in the assumption that unemployed workers are to blame for their own unemployment,â€ Anne Paxton, a staff attorney for the Unemployment Law Project in Washington, wrote in the public comments.
Even a few employers expressed concern about the rule, which is notable considering it would allow businesses to save money on unemployment costs.
â€œI am in favor of drug testing, however, testing someone that is attempting to collect on the benefits they rightfully deserve seems out of line,â€ wrote John Beebe, owner of BBâ€™s Truck & Auto Service in Erie, Pennsylvania. â€œWe should be supporting and helping them return to the work force. As [an] employer, I drug test all of my applicant[s] before hiring them. I believe this satisfies all testing requirements.â€
The number of people applying for unemployment is super-low
Itâ€™s really hard for the Trump administration to make the argument that states need the option to test more workers for drug use.
Not only is the national unemployment rate low, but in April the number of people filing unemployment claims also hit a 49-year low. A total of 192,000 people applied for assistance during the second week of April. The last time the number was that low was in September 1969.
This chart shows exactly how small that number is in a historical context:
Christina Animashaun/Vox
Thereâ€™s also no sign of rampant fraud in the unemployment insurance program that might warrant stricter rules. The changes seem specifically designed to keep more people from accessing the safety net program, which is entirely paid for by employers.
The rule goes into effect on November 4."
"For years, health experts have been saying that to decrease the risk of heart attacks and cancer, itâ€™s wise to cut back on red meat, and especially processed red meat, like bacon.
This week, that conventional wisdom was upended. Five systematic reviews, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that the unhealthful effects of regular meat consumption are negligible. (There remains a strong environmental, and ethical, case for reducing meat consumption â€” thatâ€™s just not what these reviews looked at.)
But while the new red meat decree might feel jarring, itâ€™s not actually a bad thing for nutrition â€” or even science generally. In fact, this is how science is supposed to work.
The real story behind the meat news is that a widespread understanding about nutrition was changed by better science and stronger methodology. And itâ€™s not just nutrition science thatâ€™s experiencing this kind of reckoning.
Other influential research in psychology has also been toppled by more refined scientific methods lately â€” thatâ€™s what the â€œreplication crisisâ€ is all about. Itâ€™s a big deal, and a pattern worth looking at if we want to understand why the things we thought we knew keep turning out to be wrong.
Why nutrition science is getting better
A growing chorus of critics has been pointing out that the bedrock of nutrition science â€” large, observational studies â€” are often hopelessly limited in their ability to give us clear answers about which foods are beneficial for health.
For example, with case-control studies â€” a type of observational research â€” researchers start with an endpoint (for example, people who already have cancer). For each person with a disease (a case), they find a match (a control) â€” or someone who doesnâ€™t have the disease. They then look backward in time and try to determine if any patterns of exposure (in this case, eating meat) differed in those with cancer compared to those who donâ€™t have cancer.
But since meat eaters differ so fundamentally from those who donâ€™t eat meat, as weâ€™ve explained, the reasons the two groups have varying health outcomes could have nothing to do with eating meat. Researchers try to control for â€œconfounding factors,â€ the unmeasured variables that may lead to one person getting cancer, and another staying healthy. But they canâ€™t capture all of them.
So these relatively weak study designs are not meant to be a source for definitive statements about how a single food or nutrient increased or decreased the risk of a disease by a specific percentage.
Why have so many of these studies been done? Because they can give nutrition researchers a sense of what they might study in a more rigorous (and expensive) randomized trial. One observational study canâ€™t tell you much. But if many of the best quality observational studies (such as cohort studies) find a large effect on a disease in the data, theyâ€™re probably pointing to something real.
Yet guidelines in the past havenâ€™t taken a nuanced approach to evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different types of nutrition studies.
Instead, theyâ€™ve relied on a broad range of research, including animal evidence and case-control studies. Just four years ago, the World Health Organizationâ€™s International Agency for Research on Cancer announced that people should cut back on processed meats if they wanted to avoid certain types of cancer. The American Heart Association and the US governmentâ€™s dietary guidelines panel, meanwhile, have been beating the drum about a plant-rich diet for years.
The new meat studies attempted to hold nutrition research to a higher standard.
The 14 researchers behind the papers sorted through the noise of observational studies â€” picking out only the strongest among them (i.e. the large cohort studies), while also relying on higher quality evidence from randomized controlled trials to draw their conclusions. The authors were making a deliberate effort to ensure nutrition advice is based on only the best-available research, with conclusions that are more reliable.
The result isnâ€™t perfect. One can argue that nutrition science is so flawed, perhaps we shouldnâ€™t be making guidelines at all. Or that people need guidance about what to eat, and reviews like the meat studies at least show the holes in our knowledge, what studies we need to make even stronger guidelines.
Nutrition science crusaders havenâ€™t just been picking on weak observational studies. Theyâ€™ve also been challenging some of the most respected randomized trials in nutrition by looking back at trial data using sophisticated statistical tests to pick out flaws.
The PREDIMED study was one target. Conducted in Spain, it tracked more than 7,400 people at high risk of cardiovascular disease. And the researchers stopped the trial early, after they found the Mediterranean diet, when supplemented with lots of olive oil or nuts, could cut a personâ€™s risk of cardiovascular disease by a third. A recent review of the data showed the trial was poorly run, and PREDIMEDâ€™s conclusions have since been called into question.
Ideas in social science are being overturned and debated, too
That nutrition science is updating old findings with new evidence does not mean the science is fatally flawed. Science moves along incrementally. Itâ€™s a long, grinding process involving false starts, dead ends, and studies that in hindsight may turn out to be poorly executed.
If anything, the meat studies remind us the science is getting better.

The 7 biggest problems facing science, according to 270 scientists
A similar trend can be seen in social science, where researchers have been reevaluating classic textbook findings with more rigorous methodology, and discovering many are flawed.
The â€œreplication crisisâ€ in psychology started around 2010, when a paper using completely accepted experimental methods was published purporting to find evidence that people were capable of perceiving the future, which is impossible. This prompted a reckoning: Common practices like drawing on small samples of college students were found to be insufficient to find true experimental effects.
Scientists thought if you could find an effect in a small number of people, that effect must be robust. But often, significant results from small samples turn out to be statistical flukes.
The crisis intensified in 2015 when a group of psychologists, which included Nosek, published a report in Science with evidence of an overarching problem: When 270 psychologists tried to replicate 100 experiments published in top journals, only around 40 percent of the studies held up. The remainder either failed or yielded inconclusive data. The replications that did work showed weaker effects than the original papers. (The â€œcrisisâ€ has also inspired investigations revealing outright scientific malpractice, and not just methodological errors.)
There are so many textbook psychology findings that have either not been replicated, or are currently in the midst of a serious reevaluation.
Like:
Social priming: People who read â€œoldâ€-sounding words (like â€œnursing homeâ€) were more likely to walk slowly â€” showing how our brains can be subtly â€œprimedâ€ with thoughts and actions.
The facial feedback hypothesis: Merely activating muscles around the mouth caused people to become happier â€” demonstrating how our bodies tell our brains what emotions to feel.
Stereotype threat: Minorities and maligned social groups didnâ€™t perform as well on tests due to anxieties about becoming a stereotype themselves.
Ego depletion: the idea that willpower is a finite mental resource
The â€œmarshmallow test,â€ a series of studies from the early â€™90s that suggested the ability to delay gratification at a young age is correlated with success later in life. New research finds that if the original marshmallow test authors had a larger sample size, and greater research controls, their results would not have been the showstoppers they were in the â€™90s.
The Stanford Prison Experiment: Recent investigations into the experimentâ€™s archive greatly undermine the experimentâ€™s conclusion â€” that bad behavior is the result of environments. It turns out many people involved in the experiment were coached into being cruel while working in a simulated prison, and the prisoners acted out, in part, because they simply wanted to leave the experiment.
Again, these reevaluations arenâ€™t evidence that science is doomed. They can be seen as a sign of progress (and like everything in science, even the severity of the replication crisis is hotly debated.) Itâ€™s also not the case that we should doubt every single scientific finding thatâ€™s out there in the public. Certainly, scientists have put in the painstaking work to prove that climate change is caused by humans. This conclusion is certainly not the result of a single study: Itâ€™s the result of thousands of good studies.
A part of this reckoning is recognizing that evidence can be strong or weak. And not all published findings should be treated as equal. In a lot of ways, human beings are a lot harder to study than other natural phenomena.
In science, too often, the first demonstration of an idea becomes the lasting one â€” in both pop culture and academia. But this isnâ€™t how science is supposed to work at all.
So next time you read about some kernel of conventional wisdom being questioned, know thereâ€™s a reason: Itâ€™s probably part of the quest to make science better.

"House Democratsâ€™ impeachment inquiry into President Trump has turned up a major new trove of evidence: text messages, some of which Democrats released Thursday night. In the messages, State Department officials discuss the effort to pressure the Ukrainian president.
The texts are ugly. They reveal that top State Department diplomats worked with the presidentâ€™s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to try to get Ukraine to commit to politicized investigations demanded by President Trump into the gas company Hunter Biden served on the board of â€” Burisma â€” as well as into Ukraineâ€™s role in the 2016 election. Trump has been trying to drum up phony scandals on both topics, to hurt Bidenâ€™s presidential run and discredit the Mueller investigation.
The texts reveal that the pressure campaign was presented this July as a quid pro quo â€” if Ukraine committed to these investigations, the US would agree to a White House meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky. For weeks, these State officials tried to get Zelensky to publicly announce he was conducting these investigations, in exchange for the meeting â€” but Zelensky apparently refused. (The Bidens are never mentioned by name in these texts, â€œBurismaâ€ is used instead, but Trump was not so careful when talking to Zelensky on the phone in July.)
Kurt Volker, the special representative to Ukraine who recently resigned, provided the texts to Congress in advance of his closed-door testimony Thursday. The texts were Volkerâ€™s exchanges, or exchanges he was copied on, with State Department officials, Giuliani, and an adviser to the Ukrainian president. The House Intelligence Committee released them Thursday.
The texts get even uglier in late August and early September. Thatâ€™s when Trumpâ€™s decision to hold up $400 million in military aid for Ukraine entered the discussion. One State diplomat, Bill Taylor, twice raised concerns that this was connected to Trumpâ€™s demands for investigations and with US politics. And, twice, Ambassador Gordon Sondland responded by urging him to talk on the phone rather than by text message.
â€œAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?â€ Taylor wrote on September 1. â€œCall me,â€ Sondland answered.
Eight days later, Taylor wrote: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.â€ Sondland responded by denying that this was the case â€” and urging him not to text about the matter anymore.
We should keep in mind that these messages are only â€œa subset of the full body of the materialsâ€ from House Democrats â€” so itâ€™s at least possible that they could be missing some context. (Democrats say they hope to release the rest after reviewing them for personally identifiable information.) But what we have does not look good for the Trump administration.
The key players involved in these texts
Kurt Volker, who was the US special representative for Ukraine from 2017 until his resignation last week due to the scandal. (Itâ€™s unclear whether he was pushed out or quit voluntarily.) Previously a career foreign service officer before nearly a decade in the private sector, Volker somewhat oddly held the Ukraine envoy role part-time while also working for the lobbying firm BGR Group. Volker voluntarily went in to testify to House Democrats on Thursday and handed over these text messages. The messages show him as a willing participant in the effort to press Ukraine to launch the investigations Trump wanted.
Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, was a hotel company executive and a donor to Trumpâ€™s campaign and inauguration. Heâ€™s reportedly closer to the White House than Volker, and in the texts, heâ€™s also more enthusiastic about defending Trump. Throughout the texts, he works closely with Volker on the effort to pressure Ukraine. When the topic of Trump blocking military aid to Ukraine comes up, he wants to talk on the phone rather than text about it.
Bill Taylor is currently the top US diplomat in the US embassy in Ukraine. Heâ€™s had a lengthy career in diplomacy, including a stint as ambassador to Ukraine under George W. Bush. In the texts, Taylor strongly expresses concerns about pushing the Ukrainians to launch investigations that would help Trump politically.
Rudy Giuliani is, of course, Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer, who has no official position in the government but whom these State officials seem to be working with or even for.
Andrey Yermak is an adviser to President Zelensky. In the texts, Yermak pushes US officials to agree to a meeting between Trump and Zelensky. He voices openness to the idea of announcing the investigations.
There are also shorthand references in the texts to â€œZâ€ (Zelensky) and â€œSâ€ (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo), among others. And we should note that, though dates and timestamps are listed for the texts, there is a bit uncertainty on precise timings, because itâ€™s unclear who is in which time zone at various points.
The initial quid pro quo: Investigations for a Trump meeting
For background, Zelensky had just taken office in May, after winning as an outsider presidential candidate. He badly wanted good relations with the US, due to Ukraineâ€™s continuing military conflict with Russia. But though Trump had called Zelensky on Ukraineâ€™s election night, relations had seemingly cooled since then (Trump had ordered Vice President Mike Pence to cancel a planned trip to Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration).
So the texts begin in July of this year, as Volker (the US special representative for Ukraine) and Sondland (US ambassador to the EU) tried to set up a phone call between Trump and Zelensky â€” by involving Rudy Giuliani.
Volker texted Giuliani on July 19: â€œMr. Mayor â€” really enjoyed breakfast this morning. As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.â€
That same day, Volker and Sondland exchanged texts. Sondland said it looks like here will be a â€œPotus call tomorrow,â€ and said he spoke â€œdirectly to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. Heâ€™s got it.â€ Volker mentions his breakfast with Giuliani, and Volker writes (apparently reporting what Giuliani told him): â€œMost impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation â€” and address any specific personnel issues.â€
Then, two days later, Taylor (the top US diplomat in Ukraine) expresses concerns, saying heâ€™s heard that â€œPresident Zelenskyy is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.â€
Sondland responds that itâ€™s important to â€œget the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.â€
So what appears to be happening here is that Volker and Sondland are trying to get Trump to give the new Ukrainian regime a chance. But they have heard, including from Giuliani, that what Trump wants is clear: Zelenskyâ€™s commitment to â€œinvestigations.â€
Taylor says that Zelensky seems concerned about this (because itâ€™s related to â€œWashington domestic, reelection politicsâ€), but Sondland insists that itâ€™s important to build a relationship between Trump and Zelensky â€œirrespective of the pretext.â€
Volker makes things even clearer in a July 25 text, apparently shortly before Trumpâ€™s phone call with Zelensky that day. Volker writes, â€œHeard from White House â€” assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / â€œget to the bottom of what happenedâ€ in 20-16, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.â€
We should note Volker doesnâ€™t mention the Biden investigation here, but instead the other investigation that Trump would bring up (into Ukraineâ€™s role in the 2016 election and the FBIâ€™s Russia probe). Also, the White House offer in response is a Washington visit for Zelensky, not millions of dollars in military aid. But still, itâ€™s a very clear quid pro quo and is said to be coming from the White House itself.
Yermak, Zelenskyâ€™s adviser, understood this perfectly well â€” after the call (the one weâ€™ve seen the partial transcript for), he texted Volker mentioning both dates for a Washington visit and asking for dates he could meet Giuliani in Madrid. The two are connected.
In August, State officials and Giuliani pressed Ukraine to publicly commit to the investigations
The next exchanges are dated August 9, and thereâ€™s a new topic discussed â€” a â€œstatementâ€ that Trumpâ€™s people wanted Zelensky to make. It would announce that Ukraine would conduct the two investigations Trump asked for on his call with Zelensky: one into Burisma (the Ukrainian gas company Hunter Biden sat on the board of) and one into Ukraineâ€™s role in the 2016 elections.
â€œI think potus really wants the deliverable,â€ Sondland writes. He adds that it would be good to get a draft of the statement from Yermak in advance to â€œavoid misunderstandings.â€
Volker then texted Giuliani, asking to chat by phone â€œto make sure I advise Z correctly as to what he should be saying.â€ Giuliani says thatâ€™s a good idea.
The next day, Yermak says it would be â€œpossibleâ€ to make this declaration, but that it would make more sense to do it â€œafter we receive a confirmation of dateâ€ (for Zelenskyâ€™s White House visit).
â€œOnce we have a date,â€ Yermak says, heâ€™ll call for a press briefing in which heâ€™ll announce â€œamong other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations.â€
Volker then sends some exact language for the statement to Sondland â€” mentioning Burisma and the 2016 elections â€” and they say theyâ€™ll send it to Yermak. (According to CNNâ€™s Jeremy Herb, Giuliani had pressed Volker for the explicit inclusion of both topics.)
A few days later, Sondland asks Volker, â€œDo we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Boresma?â€ Volker answers: â€œThatâ€™s the clear message so far...â€
So it appears that Zelenskyâ€™s team did not want to explicitly commit to both of those investigations â€” and the â€œmessageâ€ Volker got was that he had to keep pushing to get him to do so. The statement, it appears, was never released.
In late August, the military aid holdup comes into play
What many believe to be the most appalling part of this scandal is the allegation that Trump blocked $400 million in military aid for Ukraine as part of this pressure campaign â€” which would be threatening Ukraineâ€™s security if it doesnâ€™t help take down Biden for him.
Itâ€™s ugly stuff, and the timeline of Trumpâ€™s decision to block the aid is conspicuous â€” he did it in mid-July, shortly before his call with Zelensky. However, itâ€™s been unclear when the Ukrainians learned he had done that, and this aid they expected was truly in jeopardy.
These texts appear to suggest the aid holdup entered the discussion later â€” but that it did indeed enter the discussion.
The first reference to it is in texts dated the early morning of August 29 (again, the time zone is unclear here), Zelenskyâ€™s adviser, Yermak, messaged Volker: â€œNeed to talk to you.â€ He then sent a link to a Politico story headlined: â€œTrump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia.â€ (This was the first day news broke about this.)
A few days later, Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat at the US embassy in Ukraine, seems to have come under the impression that the aid holdup was indeed tied to Trumpâ€™s demand for investigations. â€œAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?â€ he texted three days later, on September 1.
Sondlandâ€™s response â€” â€œCall meâ€ â€” raises an eyebrow.
As many have observed, Sondland seems to want to move the conversation to a phone call â€” which, unlike texts, would leave no documentary paper trail. Itâ€™s also worth pointing out that, if the answer to his question was clearly â€œno, weâ€™re not conditioning security assistance on investigations,â€ Sondland could have just ... said that. But he didnâ€™t say that.
A week later, the situation was still up in the air. Sondland mentions â€œmultiple convosâ€ with Zelensky and Trump, and he wants to talk on the phone. In Taylorâ€™s message afterward, they discuss an â€œinterviewâ€ that the Ukrainians were apparently supposed to give. (Itâ€™s not clear what that is.) â€œThe nightmare is they give the interview and donâ€™t get the security assistance,â€ Taylor writes â€” and he makes clear that heâ€™d â€œquitâ€™ if that happened.
About 12 hours later, Taylor was still very concerned. â€œCounting on you to be right about this interview, Gordon,â€ he writes, to Sondland.
Then, Taylor writes, in perhaps the most remarkable exchange of the batch: â€œAs I said on the phone, I think itâ€™s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.â€
Sondland takes four-and-a-half hours to respond (itâ€™s unclear if he was sleeping or doing other things). But when he does answer, itâ€™s a doozy.
â€œBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trumpâ€™s intentions,â€ Sondland writes. â€œThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quoâ€™s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text. If you still have concerns, I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly.â€
So what happened there?
First, Taylor put something theyâ€™d talked about on the phone in writing â€” his objections to the idea of withholding the military aid in exchange for â€œhelp with a political campaign.â€ Now remember, Taylor asked Sondland whether they are now â€œsayingâ€ the aid was linked to investigations eight days earlier. Sondland, it seems, failed to dissuade him of the idea that these things were linked.
Then more than four hours passed. And then Sondland sent a several-sentence response that, if you can read Washington-speak, looks a lot like ass-covering â€” a phony attempt to make himself (and Trump) look not quite so bad should the texts leak or get into investigatorsâ€™ hands.
Sondland reverts to talking points, claiming Trump truly cares about corruption in Ukraine and that there are â€œno quid pro quo[s]. â€œAnd, once again, he tells Taylor not to talk about this in a way that could leave documentary evidence â€” â€œI suggest we stop the back and forth by textâ€ â€” and recommends the phone instead. He also suggests calling â€œSâ€ â€” which is how State officials refer to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo â€” or Lisa Kenna, an aide in Pompeoâ€™s office.
And thatâ€™s the last text exchange in the batch. Two days later, on September 11, the White House released its hold on the military aid for Ukraine, allowing it to go through. Why they suddenly did so is unclear.
The big picture
Trumpâ€™s â€œno quid pro quoâ€ line is no longer tenable after these texts. They make it unmistakably clear what the quid pro quo was. At first, Ukraine agrees to the investigations in exchange for Trump agreeing to host a Zelensky White House visit.
Details are still murky, however, about the holdup in military aid and how it played into this pressure campaign. Taylorâ€™s texts raising concerns about the matter are certainly suggestive â€” as is Sondlandâ€™s hesitancy to discuss it by text â€” but weâ€™re still missing further facts and evidence about what happened here. Testimony from Taylor could, theoretically, help with that.
More broadly, Volker and Sondland may well have believed they were in a tough position. Itâ€™s entirely possible their priority really was helping improve relations between Trump and Ukraine, and given Trumpâ€™s fixation on the investigations, they may have felt they had no other choice other than to push Ukraine on the topic. Overall, though, the texts tell the story of how top State Department diplomats were enlisted to serve Trumpâ€™s personal and political needs.

When activist Tarana Burke started the Me Too campaign more than 10 years ago, her goal was â€œto spread a message for survivors: Youâ€™re heard, youâ€™re understood.â€ When actress Alyssa Milano helped kick off the current phase of the movement two years ago, she wanted to â€œgive people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.â€
As they made clear, #MeToo has always been about raising awareness of the prevalence and pernicious impact of sexual violence. Itâ€™s also about creating change: As Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, told Vox last year, â€œ#MeToo is a movement of survivors and their supporters, powered by courage, determined to end sexual violence and harassment.â€
But at this point, two years after a New York Times exposÃ© on allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein helped make #MeToo a topic of conversation across America, what has really changed? As a journalist covering the issue, itâ€™s a question I hear more often than almost any other: Survivors have shared their stories, some powerful men have lost their jobs, but at a broader social level is anything really different?
To help answer that question, I looked at some of the changes that have taken place as a result of #MeToo, from state laws to monetary compensation for survivors. The efforts and reforms listed below show that while sexual harassment, assault, and misconduct remain systemic problems, the #MeToo movement has helped motivate Americans to solve them.
States are banning nondisclosure agreements that cover sexual harassment
One of the systemic problems exposed by coverage of Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men was the use of nondisclosure agreements. For example, Zelda Perkins, Weinsteinâ€™s former assistant, signed an agreement as part of a settlement that prevented her from telling even family members that Weinstein had exposed himself to her repeatedly, including forcing her to take dictation while he bathed, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The agreement kept Perkins from speaking out for almost 20 years. As her story and others made clear, such agreements allowed wealthy and powerful people to essentially buy othersâ€™ silence, preventing anyone from finding out about sexual misconduct allegations against them â€” and potentially putting others at risk.
But as the #MeToo movement gained attention, several states passed laws prohibiting the use of nondisclosure agreements in sexual misconduct cases. In September 2018, California banned the agreements in cases involving sexual assault, harassment, or sex discrimination. New York and New Jersey enacted similar laws. The federal BE HEARD Act â€” introduced earlier this year by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and others â€” also bans some types of nondisclosure agreements.
â€œI donâ€™t think I understood the impact of being silent for 20 years,â€ Perkins told the LA Times. Under the new laws, others may have an easier time speaking out.
States are also introducing protections for more workers
Federal sexual harassment law and most state laws donâ€™t protect independent contractors; the laws only apply to employees. That means people who are technically self-employed, from actors to makeup artists to Uber drivers, may have little legal recourse if theyâ€™re harassed on a job.
Moreover, millions of domestic and farm workers â€” the people who clean Americansâ€™ homes, care for their children, and harvest their food â€” lack sexual harassment protections because they work for employers with fewer than 15 employees, as Voxâ€™s Alexia FernÃ¡ndez Campbell reported last year. These workers, disproportionately women of color and often making a low wage, have nowhere to turn if they are harassed.
But in some places, thatâ€™s starting to change. New York expanded its sexual harassment law to cover independent contractors in 2018 and improved protections for domestic workers in 2019. California broadened its law in 2018 to offer protections for people harassed in an expanded set of business relationships â€” including, notably, relationships with producers.
Meanwhile, hundreds of domestic and farm workers rallied in Washington last year to urge Congress to extend harassment protections to cover them. The BE HEARD Act would do that, giving protections to independent contractors, domestic workers, and more.
The Timeâ€™s Up Legal Defense Fund has helped over 3,600 people seek justice
For many people, bringing a sexual harassment lawsuit is prohibitively expensive. Thatâ€™s why Timeâ€™s Up, a group of women in Hollywood working to fight harassment, started the Timeâ€™s Up Legal Defense Fund, aimed at helping survivors of sexual misconduct, especially in low-wage industries, get legal representation. Since the fund launched in January 2018, it has raised over $24 million and connected 3,677 people with attorneys to pursue possible legal action, according to a fact sheet provided to Vox by Timeâ€™s Up.
One person whoâ€™s gotten help through the fund is Brittany Hoyos, who says an older coworker at McDonaldâ€™s began making unwanted advances toward her when she was just 16 years old, according to the Timeâ€™s Up statement. She refused them, but he began spreading rumors about her at work, she said, and she was ultimately fired. She and her mother, who says she faced retaliation at the same restaurant, joined more than 20 other McDonaldâ€™s workers in filing complaints against the company in May.
â€œJust because youâ€™re going through a lower job in societyâ€™s eyes, that doesnâ€™t mean you should have to go through the obstacles and challenges that I did,â€ Hoyos told the New York Times.
The movement to end the tipped minimum wage is gaining steam
Restaurant workers are often forced to put up with harassment from customers for fear that reporting the behavior or otherwise trying to put a stop to it could result in the loss of a tip. And for many waiters and other workers, losing tips means losing the ability to pay basic bills because the federal minimum wage for these workers is just $2.13 an hour. The idea behind the â€œtipped minimum wageâ€ is that workers make the rest in gratuities â€” and while employers are supposed to make up the difference if tips fall short, they donâ€™t always do so.
For that reason, restaurant workers and their advocates have long argued that ending the tipped minimum wage is necessary to fight harassment. Seven states have done so already, and the movement has gained steam with the rise of #MeToo. Legislation to require tipped workers to get the same minimum wage as other workers has been proposed recently in Massachusetts, as well as in cities like Chicago.
The House passed a bill in August that would raise the tipped minimum wage to meet the standard minimum wage (itâ€™s unlikely to pass the Senate). The BE HEARD Act would also eliminate the tipped minimum wage.
Congress has reformed some of its process for staffers reporting sexual harassment
Since #MeToo entered its most public phase, allegations against legislators on both sides of the aisle â€” including Reps. Blake Farenthold, John Conyers, Trent Franks, and Sen. Al Franken â€” have drawn attention to the issue of sexual misconduct by members of Congress. Perhaps surprisingly, Congress has actually taken steps to reform itself as a workplace, as Li Zhou reported for Vox.
Last year, Congress passed legislation addressing a number of issues advocates had raised with its process for congressional employees to report harassment or assault. The law eliminated a mandatory three-month waiting period for people reporting misconduct, during which the survivor would have to go through counseling and mediation before filing a lawsuit. It also barred legislators from using taxpayer money to cover harassment settlements â€” last year, a report revealed that nearly $300,000 of taxpayer funds had been used for that purpose since 2003.
The law doesnâ€™t do everything advocates wanted, Zhou notes; it doesnâ€™t provide staffers with guaranteed legal counsel, for example. But by passing legislation to regulate itself, Congress at least started to address the problem.
Some survivors are getting financial restitution
Though the case began to come to light before #MeToo entered its current phase, the trial of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar has become one of the defining moments of the #MeToo era. Last January, Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for sexually abusing more than 100 young athletes, in addition to an earlier 60-year sentence on child pornography charges. During his sentencing hearing, 163 people gave moving and at times heartbreaking testimony about how his abuse had harmed them and their families.
Nassar wasnâ€™t the only one implicated in the case. Officials at Michigan State University, where he was a sports medicine physician, were accused of looking the other way and failing to act on athletesâ€™ reports. After a private negotiation with lawyers for over 300 people, the university created a $500 million settlement fund. It was believed to be the largest such fund ever created by a university in response to a sexual abuse case, according to the New York Times. Through the fund, survivors could get between $250,000 and $2.5 million each.
While the Michigan State fund was one of the most high-profile settlements, monetary awards in sexual misconduct cases in general have risen in the #MeToo era. In 2018, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed 41 sexual harassment lawsuits, more than a 50 percent increase over 2017, according to MarketWatch. The EEOC won $70 million from companies on behalf of harassment survivors in 2018, up 47 percent from 2017.
Americans have changed how they think about power
One of the biggest effects of the #MeToo movement has been to show Americans and people around the world how widespread sexual harassment, assault, and other misconduct really are. As more and more survivors spoke out, they learned they were not alone. And people who had never had cause to think about sexual harassment before suddenly saw how much it had affected their coworkers, children, parents, and friends.
All this has helped to change how many Americans think not just about sexual misconduct but also about gender and power. Those changes were especially evident in Americansâ€™ reactions to the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford. According to a December 2018 poll by the research firm PerryUndem, those hearings made 50 percent of voters think about men having more power than women in government.
In a follow-up poll conducted by PerryUndem in September, 49 percent of voters and a full 76 percent of Democrats agreed with the statement that â€œone reason Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed is because white men want to hold onto their power in government.â€
â€œWe wouldâ€™ve never seen this three or four years ago,â€ Tresa Undem, a partner at PerryUndem, told Vox at the time. Overall, she said, Americans are thinking more than ever about power: who has it, who doesnâ€™t, and how those with more power are trying to control those with less. There are a lot of reasons for that, including the election of Donald Trump, but #MeToo has been a significant driving force behind the change, she said.
Thereâ€™s much the #MeToo movement has yet to accomplish, from changes in federal law to real safety for survivors who speak out, many of whom still face harsh repercussions. But two years after the movement began to make headlines around the country, its impact â€” in statehouses, in court, and in the conversations Americans are having with one another â€” is undeniable."
"The earned income tax credit (EITC), one of the largest tax benefits distributed every year, exists to do one thing in particular: encourage low-income people to work. But new research suggests: Maybe it doesnâ€™t?
A research paper from Princeton economist Henrik Kleven, released in draft form in September after circulating as a set of slides for months, looks at the EITCâ€™s creation and the four times itâ€™s been expanded, including a big increase in the creditâ€™s value in 1993.
Kleven found, consistent with several past studies, that the 1993 increase was followed by a large increase in employment. But he finds that no other increase had this effect, and that the 1993 increase might have more to do with both state and federal welfare reforms and the economic boom of the â€™90s than with the EITC itself.
Klevenâ€™s conclusion is a stark departure from the existing literature on the credit, and, if true, undermines the case for the EITC on both the left and right. Conservatives and business interests have long grudgingly tolerated or outright supported modest expansions of the EITC because of its tie to work: It isnâ€™t welfare, but an earned benefit that helps the economy by increasing labor force participation. If it doesnâ€™t help labor force participation, that rationale goes away.
Similarly, liberals have long supported the program as a politically realistic way to direct money to low-income people, a benefit whose impact is boosted by the additional wages recipients earn because the credit pushes them to work more. But if the conservative rationale for it is bunk, and the additional pay doesnâ€™t result because the credit doesnâ€™t actually spur more work, then this rationale similarly falls away.
The policy alternatives toward which Klevenâ€™s findings push people are pretty much diametric opposites. For conservatives, the Kleven research suggests that welfare reform was more effective at pushing people into work than previously thought, and that similar welfare reforms extended to programs like food stamps might be similarly effective.
For liberals and leftists, the research suggests that the EITCâ€™s tie to work could be severed completely without major economic damage, and the government should move toward a no-strings-attached cash subsidy for the poor, like a basic income or negative income tax.
Kleven doesnâ€™t endorse either of these strategies â€” he doesnâ€™t offer a prescriptive takeaway at all â€” and itâ€™s entirely possible future studies will contradict his conclusion, just as he contradicts the conclusions of studies before him. But the study is already influencing DC policy conversations, and fits with a broader shift away from bipartisan cooperation for policies like EITC and toward more aggressive and distinct approaches in each party.
A brief summary of what the EITC does
Before we get too in the weeds, letâ€™s review the policy weâ€™re talking about.
The EITC is a tax credit that workers typically receive in a big lump sum when they file their tax returns in the spring. It differs from most tax credits in that itâ€™s â€œrefundableâ€: Even if you donâ€™t earn enough money to pay income taxes, you can still get the credit in your tax refund.
The credit is tiny for childless adults, topping out at $529 for 2019, but very substantial for parents, with benefits maxing out at $6,557 for families with three or more kids. It phases in with each dollar you earn, and phases out gradually; the rates differ based on how many kids you have, and are summarized in the chart below, but a single mother of two gets 45 cents for every dollar she earns up to her first $14,570 in earnings; at $19,030 in earnings and above, the credit starts phasing out at 21.06 cents on the dollar, until itâ€™s totally gone for a single mom making $46,073 or more.
The EITCâ€™s â€œtrapezoidsâ€ for workers with different numbers of children. The more kids, the bigger the trapezoid. Tax Policy Center
The result looks a bit like a trapezoid, as you can see above; the EITC is sometimes known in tax circles as a â€œtrapezoidalâ€ policy for this reason (tax circles are extremely fun).
The thresholds are different for married couples, but thereâ€™s still a marriage penalty: marrying a partner can bump your income up enough that you no longer benefit from the credit or losing hundreds or thousands of dollars in benefits, creating a strong reason to stay unmarried.
The EITC was first introduced in 1975 but has been expanded four times since: in 1986 (as part of that yearâ€™s landmark tax reform), 1990, 1993, and 2009 (as part of the stimulus package). Twenty-nine states, plus DC and Puerto Rico, also have state EITCs that supplement the federal credit.
Klevenâ€™s conclusion: all but maybe one EITC expansion did nothing for employment
So Klevenâ€™s paper specifically focuses on the labor force participation of single mothers â€” that is, single mothers who are employed or are looking for work â€” because they get the best deal out of the credit. If the credit spurs anyone to work, it should be them. In particular, he compares their labor force participation rates to those for single women without children, who were mostly unaffected by EITC increases.
Labor force participation for single women with and without children, from 1968 onward. Henrik Kleven
He finds that from 1968 and 1992, a period that encompassed the 1975 introduction of the EITC and major expansions in 1986 and 1990, the gap didnâ€™t change at all. You would expect single women with children to catch up if they responded to a big new subsidy by jumping into the workforce. That didnâ€™t happen.
Kleven validates this conclusion by doing more careful, controlled event studies comparing labor force participation and employment pre- and post-reform, and comes up empty: â€œApart from the 1993 reform, all estimates are either small and statistically insignificant or they are negative,â€ he finds. After the 1993 EITC expansion, labor force participation grew by about 3 percentage points for single mothers. But the 1975, 1986, 1990, and 2009 expansions of the EITC didnâ€™t have any effect on labor force participation or employment, according to his analysis. Nor did state EITC enactments and expansions.
This finding directly contradicts that of an early paper on the EITC, by Georgetownâ€™s Nada Eissa and Harvardâ€™s Jeffrey Liebman. In that 1996 study, Eissa and Liebman found that single women with children saw their labor force participation grow by almost three points relative to single women without children after the 1986 EITC expansion. Kleven disputes that paper by noting that â€œmost of the effect goes away between 1990 and 1991, i.e. after the 1990 reform had enacted further EITC expansions.â€ That suggests, he says, that fluctuations in employment in the late â€™80s were the result of something other than the EITC. (Iâ€™ve asked Eissa for comment on the Kleven paper and will update when I hear back.)
The case that welfare reform is more important than EITC
That leaves 1993. Kleven is skeptical here too. The EITC expansion that year, spearheaded by newly elected President Bill Clinton, was larger for families with two kids or more than for families with one kid â€” but employment increased for families with one child as well. More importantly, he finds that when you control for state unemployment and state welfare waivers that placed new restrictions on access to welfare from 1994 to 1996, any employment effects of the EITC go away.
The conclusion: welfare reform pushed a bunch of people off welfare and into work, and the EITC didnâ€™t do much of anything for employment, not least because itâ€™s tucked in the tax code and hard to understand.
This is at odds with the prior literature on the EITC and welfare reform, which I summarized here and generally put greater weight on the EITC than welfare reform for the increase in single mothersâ€™ employment during the 1990s. A 2003 paper by UChicagoâ€™s Jeffrey Grogger, for instance, found that time limits imposed by welfare reform were less important than the EITC both in increasing employment and in reducing welfare usage.
Klevenâ€™s paper has not been peer reviewed, and most economists Iâ€™ve contacted whoâ€™ve written papers with different conclusions havenâ€™t had time to read and process it. Some of the difference appears to come down to what, precisely, Klevenâ€™s models control for that others do not.
Kleven allows the effect of welfare reform in his model to vary by year and state, in part to try to capture variations in how states implemented the policy (which gave governors and legislators a lot of latitude). But that also adds a ton of new variables to the model, which sometimes leads to over-controlling: accidentally controlling away for effects that are actually the result of the EITC but get picked up anyway by building such a large model with so many inputs.
That makes it a bit hard as a non-economist to be sure whom to believe here. Iâ€™ll put it this way: Before I read Klevenâ€™s paper, I was maybe 90 percent sure that the EITC reliably induces single mothers to work more. Klevenâ€™s taken that number down to about 60 percent certainty. Iâ€™m inclined to trust the literature before him slightly more. But Iâ€™m also much more prepared than I was before to believe that literature is wrong, and the sheer comprehensiveness of Klevenâ€™s paper lends it credibility to me.
For his part, Kleven credits some of the paperâ€™s power to its simplicity. â€œEverythingâ€™s told through very simple graphs,â€ Kleven told me. â€œWhen you look at the data, and you just plot the raw data and graphs, itâ€™s just not clear that anything is happening or anything sharp is happening around [non-1993] reforms.â€
What does this mean for policy?
As Kleven is quick to state, his paper being correct neednâ€™t damn the EITC. â€œIf the EITC doesnâ€™t have labor supply impacts, that could imply its an even better policy,â€ he says. â€œItâ€™s a pure money dump on the working poor that doesnâ€™t come with any labor supply distortions.â€
But that raises an obvious question: Why should the working poor be the only ones to get the money dump? This is the argument that EITC critics from the left like the Peopleâ€™s Policy Projectâ€™s Matt Bruenig have raised. If the EITC doesnâ€™t actually encourage work, thereâ€™s no real rationale for the â€œphase-inâ€ side of the policy. We should just give, say, mothers with two kids $6,500 cash no matter what she earns at first, and then tax it away as she earns more. It should be more like food stamps, not a subsidy to work.
Some politicians are on board with this approach too. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) has introduced the LIFT+ Act, a variation on Kamala Harrisâ€™s LIFT Act plan to expand the EITC. Tlaibâ€™s variant drops the phase-in and just offers $3,000 per adult, phasing out with income but with no work requirement.
But thereâ€™s also material for conservative welfare reform defenders, like the Joint Economic Committeeâ€™s Scott Winship, who have been insistent that the 1996 federal law and contemporaneous state experiments spurred additional employment. They typically havenâ€™t dismissed the possibility that the EITC did as much or more â€” but if Kleven is right, then the conservative case for welfare reform on the grounds that it promoted work in a population that was overly dependent on government aid gets stronger. This doesnâ€™t bear directly on whether welfare reform reduced poverty, as Winship and others argue, but itâ€™s an important part of the conservative argument.
The current major conservative push on welfare issues is to adopt tougher work requirements for food stamps, which some conservative states have already done. You could imagine the Kleven paper bolstering the argument for these, on the grounds that if work requirements effectively increased employment when applied to cash welfare, they should do the same if applied to food stamps. The Heritage Foundationâ€™s Robert Rector (one of the most vociferous and dogged opponents of all welfare programs in all of Washington) and Jennifer Marshall called work requirements for food stamps and public housing the â€œunfinished work of welfare reformâ€ in a 2013 essay.
There are many reasons to be wary of such a policy: even if food stamps deter work somewhat (and they probably do), one of the reasons Bill Clinton signed the welfare reform bill was that he thought through Medicaid and food stamps, the poorest of the poor would be guaranteed food and health care, even if they didnâ€™t work. This, he reasoned, was a basic humanitarian floor, even if giving cash was too much. But the logic of welfare reform, bolstered by the Kleven paper, does push in the direction of applying work requirements to an ever-increasing set of programs.

"The scandal around Trump, Ukraine, and the whistleblower has reached a point where a single day can bring multiple significant developments, each on somewhat separate topics.
Just on Wednesday, the State Departmentâ€™s inspector general headed to Congress for a mysterious briefing, we learned that Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) had early word of the whistleblowerâ€™s concerns, new details emerged about Vice President Mike Penceâ€™s role in Trumpâ€™s effort to pressure Ukraine, and a Washington Post story raised new questions about the supposed transcript of Trumpâ€™s call with the Ukrainian president.
And then there was also the, uh, Nickelback video Trump tweeted.
The news continued into Thursday morning as well, when Trump decided to openly declare that Ukraineâ€™s president should investigate the Bidens â€” apparently deciding to do the scandalous thing in public, perhaps to make it seem like thereâ€™s nothing scandalous about it at all.
Trump openly urged Ukraine (and also China) to investigate the Bidens
During a Wednesday press conference, Trump was posed a simple question by Jeff Mason of Reuters: What did he hope to achieve when he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens? But Trump rambled and dodged in his lengthy response, and grew irate when Mason tried to follow up.
Speaking to reporters again Thursday morning before leaving the White House to travel to Florida, Trump got a do-over. And it appears he has now decided on a clearer message: Heâ€™d just do the scandalous thing in public and assert thereâ€™s nothing wrong with it.
â€œWell I would think that if they were honest about it theyâ€™d start a major investigation into the Bidens. Itâ€™s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Bidens,â€ Trump said.
He added: â€œI would say that President Zelensky â€” if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.â€
Trump continued, â€œBecause nobody has any doubt that they werenâ€™t crooked. That was a crooked deal 100 percent. He had no knowledge of energy, didnâ€™t know the first thing about it, all of a sudden heâ€™s getting $50,000 a month plus a lot of other things. Nobody has any doubt. And they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor, they got rid of him.â€
It is indeed true that, in 2014, Hunter Biden had no apparent qualifications to be handsomely paid to sit on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. But Trump is lying when he talks about the â€œtough prosecutorâ€ â€” Viktor Shokin was pushed out due to wide agreement among Western officials that he wasnâ€™t doing enough to fight corruption. Thereâ€™s zero evidence that Vice President Biden tried to push him out to somehow help his son.
Overall, when assessing the genuineness of Trumpâ€™s professed outrage about the Bidens, itâ€™s helpful to keep in mind that Trump himself is also regularly accepting payments from foreign sources to his company, while president, and so are the Trump children.
But the bigger news is that Trump has decided that his best political defense is to be out in the open about demands for foreign investigations of his political opponents.
He even said that Chinese president Xi Jinping should investigate the Bidens as well (Hunter had business ties in China too). â€œChina should start an investigation into the Bidens,â€ Trump said, seconds after discussing the trade war and saying that if China doesnâ€™t do â€œwhat we want, we have tremendous power.â€
We learned the whistleblower went to a House Intelligence Committee staffer
Many political observers have noticed that, as the whistleblower scandal unfolded, House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff appeared to be quite informed about what was going on.
For instance, Schiff was calling attention to the possibility that Trump was withholding military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden back in late August â€” more than two weeks before the public had any idea about the whistleblower complaintâ€™s existence.
On Wednesday, the New York Timesâ€™ Julian Barnes, Michael Schmidt, and Matthew Rosenberg revealed that Schiff indeed did have a heads up.
Per the Timesâ€™ account, the whistleblower (reportedly a CIA officer) first registered his concerns through an internal CIA process but became disturbed by how the administration was handling it. So he then went to a House Intelligence Committee staffer to ask what to do. The whistleblower gave the House staffer some idea of the complaintâ€™s nature, though the account was â€œvague.â€ The House staffer advised him to find a lawyer and file a complaint with an inspector general, which the whistleblower did.
Schiff himself did not meet with the whistleblower, but the Intelligence Committee staffer did tell him some information about the complaint.
Trump and his allies have seized on this to argue that there was some impropriety here â€” that the whistleblower was in cahoots with Schiff and House Democrats, making this whole thing part of a partisan plot to bring Trump down.
In fact, this is how the whistleblower process is supposed to function. An executive branch employee with concerns reached out to the appropriate committee in Congress and got the standard and appropriate advice (find a lawyer, tell the inspector general). And of course, the substance of the complaint was eventually confirmed by the call summary document the White House itself released.
Schiff had, however, previously denied that his team had contact with the whistleblower. After the Times report revealing that wasnâ€™t true, Schiff told the Daily Beast he meant to say the person hadnâ€™t yet come in to testify, and said, â€œI regret that I wasnâ€™t much more clear.â€
The State Department inspector general headed to Capitol Hill
Earlier this week, Steve Linick, the inspector general for the State Department, told Congress he had an â€œurgentâ€ briefing for them â€” a briefing that took place Wednesday behind closed doors.
What ensued was, apparently, confusing. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the only lawmaker present, emerged to say that far from being urgent, the briefing was an â€œirrelevant distraction.â€
The briefing focused on a 40-page â€œpacketâ€ of information related to Ukraine that had been given to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo several months ago. It included conspiratorial allegations about Joe and Hunter Bidenâ€™s Ukraine work, as well as former US Ambassador to the Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. The envelope, in odd writing, was said to be be from â€œThe White House.â€
It appears that at least some of the packet originated with ... Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. According to CNN, Giuliani gave the documents to the White House, which passed them on to Pompeo. They eventually made their way to the State Departmentâ€™s top lawyer and then the inspector general and, reportedly, the FBI as well.
The details here are still murky, but the gist appears to be that Giuliani or his Ukrainian contacts put together a shady set of allegations, smearing both the Bidens and Ambassador Yovanovitch, that then made their way to the top levels of the US government. So it may have been an inappropriate effort to influence US policy or personnel with disinformation that was taken seriously by top Trump figures like Pompeo (Yovanovitch was recalled from her post in May).
Still, the nature of the IGâ€™s investigation isnâ€™t entirely clear: Is he investigating the packet as a problematic influence effort from Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer or is he taking the underlying allegations about the Bidens and Yovanovitch seriously?
A Washington Post story raised questions about the â€œtranscriptâ€ of Trumpâ€™s call with the Ukrainian president
Last week, the Trump Administration released what appeared to be a â€œtranscriptâ€ of the now-infamous July phone call in which Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Except there was a note on the bottom of the first page making clear this was â€œnot a verbatim transcript.â€ And the document also included some ellipses in curious places â€” raising questions about whether the document was altered to hide damaging information.
On Wednesday night, the Washington Postâ€™s Carol Leonnig, Craig Timberg, and Drew Harwell published a story that added to those questions. They write:
Current and former U.S. officials studying the document pointed to several elements that, they say, indicate that the document may have been handled in an unusual way.
Those include the use of ellipses â€” punctuation indicating that information has been deleted for clarity or other reasons â€” that traditionally have not appeared in summaries of presidential calls with foreign leaders, according to the current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the elaborate, non-public process.
The Post team also points out that the transcript seemed rather brief for a call that supposedly lasted 30 minutes and that â€œthe document additionally carries classification markings that Situation Room staffers do not normally add when they create a word-for-word transcript.â€ Their story concludes with this eyebrow-raising kicker:
â€œThe one that was released is not the one the Situation Room created,â€ said one person familiar with the creation of records of calls with foreign leaders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the secretive process. â€œThatâ€™s just not possible.â€
Part of the whistleblower complaint was specifically about improper White House handling of the records of this call. â€œI learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to â€˜lock downâ€™ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced â€” as is customary â€” by the White House Situation Room,â€ the complaint reads.
This new Washington Post story does not directly allege or prove any impropriety related to the call summary document. But these reportersâ€™ sources do appear to think thereâ€™s something not quite right here, so stay tuned.
People close to Mike Pence claim Mike Pence did nothing wrong
Meanwhile, a separate Washington Post story by Greg Miller, Greg Jaffe, and Ashley Parker zeroed in on the role of Vice President Mike Pence in this whole saga.
The whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump ordered Pence to cancel a planned trip to Ukraine for President Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration in May â€” and the Post story confirms thatâ€™s true.
Pence was not himself on Trumpâ€™s phone call with Zelensky on July 25 but his top national security adviser, Keith Kellogg, was, meaning a description of the call would likely have shown up in Penceâ€™s briefing book, per the Post.
Then, on September 2, Vice President Mike Pence met President Zelensky in Warsaw. At the meeting, Pence reportedly told Zelensky that hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid would be withheld unless Ukraine did a better job combating â€œcorruption.â€

At a press conference afterward, the Associated Pressâ€™s Jill Colvin asked: â€œCan you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family?â€ Pence conspicuously did not make that assurance, instead saying, â€œas President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.â€
So what did Pence know, exactly, about Trumpâ€™s efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Biden â€” and was he an active player in the effort?
â€œOfficials close to Penceâ€ insist for this Post story, though, that Pence had no idea what was going on â€” though to do so they have to concede that he either didnâ€™t do the required reading or didnâ€™t understand it. The Post team writes:
Officials close to Pence contend that he traveled to Warsaw for a meeting with Zelensky on Sept. 1 probably without having read â€” or at least fully registered â€” the transcript of Trumpâ€™s July 25 call with the leader of Ukraine.
There appear to be only two possibilities here: that Pence is remarkably clueless or that he was an active participant.
Trump tweeted a clip of a Nickelback music video altered to include Biden that Twitter then took down due to a copyright complaint
@RealDonaldTrump
Yes ... this is a real thing that happened. Itâ€™s silly.
But if you really want to know, the video was a reference to a long-running internet meme involving a clip from the 2005 music video for Nickelbackâ€™s â€œPhotograph,â€ in which singer Chad Kroeger holds up a photograph, and sings â€œLook at this photograph!â€ The meme involves altering the photograph (originally of Kroeger and his producer) for humorous ends.
So whoever made the clip Trump tweeted imposed, as the photograph, an image of Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and Hunterâ€™s business associate Devon Archer, golfing together. The intended â€œgotchaâ€ was that Biden had said he was unaware of his sonâ€™s overseas business dealings, but here he is golfing with Archer, who the video called a Ukrainian oil executive.
Devon Archer is actually American, so no, this is not an instance of Biden golfing with a Ukrainian oligarch. But Archer was Hunterâ€™s business partner for his overseas work and helped made the connection that got him and later Hunter on the board of the Ukrainian gas company, Burisma. (Archer is also a former Abercrombie and Fitch model who went to Yale and worked at Citibank, per the New Yorkerâ€™s Adam Entous.)
However, Twitter soon took down the video after a request from the copyright owner of the video, leaving this curious incident for future historians to puzzle over.

"Sen. Elizabeth Warren just released her labor platform for her presidential campaign. Itâ€™s an eye-popping 14 pages long.
Warren makes a long list of promises to close every loophole and fix every broken policy that has kept working families from getting ahead in the post-recession economy. Oh, and she wants to give workers new rights too, such as the right for gig workers to unionize.
â€œWe cannot have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people,â€ she writes in her plan. â€œWe cannot have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement.â€
The timing is key. Warren is releasing her proposal the day before a big presidential forum hosted by the Service Employees International Union. SEIU represents about 2 million janitors, home care workers, security guards, and childcare workers â€” and candidates have been jockeying for the unionâ€™s prized endorsement.
Theyâ€™ve also been trying to outdo each other to win over working-class Americans. Most Democratic frontrunners have released detailed policy platforms that promise workers everything theyâ€™ve ever wanted: paid parental leave, a $15 minimum wage, and paid sick days are just the beginning.
In many ways, Warrenâ€™s ideas mirror some of Sen. Bernie Sandersâ€™s proposals, like making it easier for workers to go on strike and letting unions bargain on behalf of an entire industry. But Warren also focuses on the minutiae â€” the little tweaks and changes that could make a real difference for working Americans.
There are three recurring themes to Warrenâ€™s plan: She wants to give workers more power, protect vulnerable workers, and crack down on companies that break US labor laws. Here are some highlights:
Warren is adamant about empowering workers
The word â€œpowerâ€ is repeated more than a dozen times in Warrenâ€™s proposal. Itâ€™s even part of her planâ€™s name: Empowering American Workers and Raising Wages. A lot of Warrenâ€™s agenda focuses on strengthening unions, which would, in turn, give workers more leverage on the job. One of the big ideas sheâ€™s endorsing is the concept of sectoral bargaining, in which unions bargain not at the company level but at the sector level â€” negotiating for all workers in an entire industry rather than just one company or workplace.
This is an idea endorsed by SEIU. And while sectoral bargaining is common in Europe, itâ€™s never been tried on a large scale in the US. The point is to remove the incentive for employers to stop their employees from unionizing, based on the fear that non-union competitors will have a cost advantage. Instead, all workers in the same industry would simply have the same minimum standard of pay and benefits.
Sectoral bargaining is the future of unions, according to Voxâ€™s Dylan Matthews, and the concept also has support from Bernie Sanders, Beto Oâ€™Rourke, and Pete Buttigieg, among others.
Warren is also championing one of her signature congressional plans, the Accountable Capitalism Act. It would require billion-dollar corporations to reserve 40 percent of their board seats for employees. Like this, she argues, CEOs would be more likely to make decisions that benefit workers, not just shareholders or the bottom line.
â€œOne of the companies that would be covered by this requirement is General Motors, where 46,000 workers represented by [United Automobile Workers] went on strike because of the companyâ€™s refusal to let workers get a fair share of the billions of dollars in profits the company has made,â€ she stated in her proposal. â€œLetting GM workers elect 40 percent of the companyâ€™s board would help ensure that workers get the wages and benefits they deserve.â€
She also wants to extend the right to unionize to more types of workers, such as government employees and low-level company supervisors.
One of laborâ€™s biggest priorities, passing the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, is also on Warrenâ€™s to-do list. The bill would ban â€œright to workâ€ laws that allow employees to opt-out of paying union fees in unionized workplaces, even though they get the benefits of collective bargaining. Doing this would boost union finances.
Warren is also tackling the trifecta of terrible corporate policies that have eroded workersâ€™ rights: non-compete clauses, no-poach agreements, and mandatory arbitration. She promises to work with Congress to ban non-compete clauses, which make it super-hard for workers to find another job in the same industry. She would also outlaw so-called â€œno poachingâ€ agreements for major franchisors like McDonaldâ€™s and Burger King, which prohibit franchisees from hiring workers from another franchise in the same chain.
â€œThese clauses depress wages and deny workers opportunities to find a better job,â€ she wrote.
And she promised to get rid of annoying arbitration agreements, which about 60 percent of non-union workers in the private sector have signed. These clauses force workers to take legal disputes to private arbitration, a quasi-legal forum with no judge, no jury, and practically no government oversight.
Clearly, Warren would need to get Congress to enact most of her ambitious proposals. But not everything on the list requires a legislative solution. For example, she said she would require all federal contractors to pay workers at least $15 an hour and would favor bids from companies with unionized workforces.
She would also rewrite labor department rules to expand overtime pay to millions more workers and to let graduate students unionize.
Ending exploitation of vulnerable workers
Perhaps more so than any other candidate, Warren has zeroed in on all the loopholes in US labor laws that deny basic protections to millions of workers. That includes Uber drivers, farmworkers, and home health aides.
She was the first presidential candidate to voice support for Californiaâ€™s AB 5 bill, which makes it harder for companies to misclassify employees as independent contractors. That simple misclassification is how construction firms, strip clubs, nail salons, and gig economy companies have managed to skirt US labor laws. Many of these employers havenâ€™t had to pay independent contractors a minimum wage, overtime, health care benefits, and unemployment insurance until the law passed month.
Not only would Warren push for a national version of AB 5, she says she would also make misclassification a labor violation, instead of a just a tax issue.
She would also amend US labor laws that explicitly exclude farmworkers and domestic workers. And she wants to give undocumented immigrants the same federal rights as any other worker, to make sure they are not exploited and used to keep wages low.
In a surprising move, Warrenâ€™s plan also acknowledges an under-the-radar effort to outlaw discrimination against black natural hairstyles. This summer, California became the first state to prohibit employers and public schools from banning braids, cornrows, dreadlocks, and other black natural hairstyles. Warren wants to develop a rule that would interpret the Civil Rights Act the same way.
Penalizing employers who do bad things
None of Warrenâ€™s policy ideas will change much if employers arenâ€™t penalized for breaking the law.
One key part of Warrenâ€™s plan involves boosting funding for agencies that enforce worker safety laws and other labor laws. That includes the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Department of Labor Civil Rights Center. â€œEach of these agencies plays a crucial role in enforcing worker protections and each is badly underfunded,â€ Warren writes.
She points out that in 1978, each OSHA inspector was responsible for safety inspections at work sites with an average of 60,000 workers. Now they inspect work sites that employ more than twice as many people.
Warren also wants to increase penalties for violations of wage-and-hour laws (i.e., overtime pay and minimum wage violations), worker safety laws, and anti-discrimination laws. Right now, the maximum penalties for companies are so low that they hardly stop companies from repeating their bad behavior. For example, according to the Department of Labor, the maximum penalty for willful or repeated violations of minimum wage and overtime laws is just $1,000, and the maximum for willful or repeated violations of child labor laws is just $10,000.
Warren said she will push to increase the maximum penalties, though she doesnâ€™t say by how much. She also plans to refer more egregious cases for criminal prosecution.
Warren claims that her new plan is the â€œmost progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal.â€ If she could wave a magic wand and make it all happen, sure, it probably would be. But thatâ€™s Warrenâ€™s biggest challenge: persuading a potentially divided Congress to pursue her ambitious ideas. Not everyone will be onboard."
"In early September, Stranger Thingsâ€™ breakout teen star Millie Bobby Brown posted a video to Instagram in which she demonstrates how to use products from her new beauty brand, Florence by Mills. Except she didnâ€™t really use the products. Instead, she performed a facsimile of scrubbing and rinsing her face, minus the suds, water, and visible results.
She was called out for the stunt across social media, and outlets like Fox News and Page Six reported on the incident. She published an apology on Instagram a few days later, writing: â€œIâ€™m still learning the best way to share my routines as I get to know this space better â€” Iâ€™m not an expert. I thought doing a quick video replicating my personal process for that night was okay, but thatâ€™s not what was conveyed. I understand, I appreciate all of your feedback on this journey, please keep sharing your thoughts and I will too!â€ Comments were disabled on the post.

Brown is just the latest in a growing cohort of A-list celebrities to launch a beauty line. Lady Gagaâ€™s Haus Laboratories makeup brand went live in mid-September, after a pre-sale on Amazon Prime Day in July. Tracee Ellis Ross recently revealed a hair care line called Pattern for curly hair. Michelle Pfeiffer has a â€œcleanâ€ fragrance brand called Henry Rose.
Victoria Beckham, a.k.a. Posh Spice-turned-high-end-fashion designer, just dropped a makeup brand in mid-September. (Her husband has a line of menâ€™s grooming products called House 99.) Gwen Stefani, Hailey Bieber, Serena Williams, and Cardi B are rumored to have lines in the works. They all join Rihanna, who arguably has one of the most successful celebrity makeup brands ever. Her Fenty Beauty brand (launched in 2017) sold almost $600 million worth of products in its first 15 months and profoundly changed the conversation about inclusivity in makeup shade ranges.
But the Brown incident is a good encapsulation of whatâ€™s going on in the beauty industry lately. (It also raises questions about whether the actress, who is only 15 years old, is maybe not being well-served by her team, who are presumably adults and could have helped prevent this gaffe. But thatâ€™s another story.) As tons of celebrities launch makeup and skin care brands, authenticity is just as important as the products theyâ€™re selling. In fact, itâ€™s a big part of the value proposition of celebrity beauty lines.
â€œAuthenticity in marketing is really key, because itâ€™s a precursor of trust. And trust is what gets people to buy into the story and itâ€™s the only thing that influences our purchase behaviors,â€ says Pamela Rutledge, a psychologist who studies media issues.
People are looking to celebrities more than ever for foundation and lotions. Now that so many celebrities make themselves available on social media, fans have fewer barriers to them. They can literally buy into the look of the celebrities they most relate to.
â€œConsumers are tired of being marketed to. They donâ€™t trust the big companies. Thatâ€™s a total shift thatâ€™s happening,â€ says Michael Yanover, the head of business development at CAA, the powerhouse LA talent and branding agency. CAA is an investor in Haus Laboratories and â€œarchitectedâ€ the idea with Gaga. Her â€œLittle Monsters,â€ as her fandom calls itself, are a built-in customer base that trusts her. She has over 37 million followers on Instagram. â€œItâ€™s easier for Gaga or Gwyneth to come along and say, â€˜Hey, you know me. Iâ€™m not going to do anything to screw you,â€ he says.

â€œA lot of our clients want to have other avenues of revenue and other opportunities. The ones with big social media realize that theyâ€™re a brand and they can create their own opportunities. They donâ€™t need to wait for the record company to call them,â€ says Yanover.
And theyâ€™re now selling at Ulta and Sephora and Amazon, thanks to this changing power dynamic in the industry. There is now an entire ecosystem to support these upstart brands that sprung up outside the traditional beauty companies like EstÃ©e Lauder and Lâ€™Oreal. While celebrities are still being paid to shill other companiesâ€™ brands, there are now more lucrative and personal avenues available to them to speak to â€” and sell to â€” fans directly.
Kylie Jenner, who is a celebrity whether you like it or not, proved that she can sell boatloads of lip kits using the power of social media alone. But these celebs are not standing around in their kitchens mixing products up, despite what cute Instagrams of them wearing hair nets and white lab coats would have you believe.
How involved are celebrities in their brands, really?
Celebs have been intimately associated with the beauty industry for a long time, and legacy brands from Chanel to Covergirl still pay big bucks for celebrity spokespeople. Elizabeth Taylor kicked off the lucrative celebrity fragrance industry in the 1980s with White Diamonds; J.Lo and her Glow franchise picked up her mantle in the early 2000s â€” and sheâ€™s still at it, just launching her 25th fragrance, called Promise. Several models, like Iman, Cindy Crawford, and Miranda Kerr, have had beauty brands for years. And who can forget Jessica Simpsonâ€™s edible beauty line? But there are many more full brands now, and theyâ€™re structured differently.
There is a continuum of ownership and involvement that celebrities have in their brands. At one end of the spectrum, celebrities are merely paid to promote a brand, which is the traditional model, with very little creative input into products and campaigns.
Viola Davis was just named as a new face of Lâ€™Oreal Paris and Margot Robbie fronts for Chanel. Theyâ€™ll show up in ads and talk about the products in magazine interviews and on the red carpet. Sometimes they get collections within a larger brand, like Victoria Beckham had at EstÃ©e Lauder last year. At the other end of the spectrum are brands that are independent entities that have their own teams and funding sources. Lady Gagaâ€™s Haus Labs, Gwyneth Paltrowâ€™s Goop empire, and Jessica Albaâ€™s Honest Company fall into this category. Most other deals fall right in the gray area middle and often the business model is very opaque.
There are traditional licensing deals, which is how many fragrances work. For example, cosmetic company Revlon owns the licenses for several celebritiesâ€™ fragrances, including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Elizabeth Taylor, and Jennifer Aniston. Celebrities are contracted to do a certain amount of promotion for these products. Sometimes theyâ€™re involved creatively and sometimes theyâ€™re not.
Kardashian Beauty, first known as Khroma and launched in 2012, is a disastrous example of licensing gone bad. There were multiple lawsuits in which other companies sued Khroma for copyright infringement and then the new owner of the brand accused the three eldest sisters of not promoting the products. It went out of business ignominiously. Before that, they had a licensed self tanning brand called Kardashian Glow, produced by New Sunshine, the same company that made Melania Trumpâ€™s now defunct skin care line.

Then there are situations in which a celebrity is a part or majority owner in a beauty business, but itâ€™s not necessarily marketed as theirs. Jennifer Aniston had a stake in Living Proof, Katie Holmes had one in Alterna hair care, and Olivia Wilde currently is part-owner of natural skin care range True Botanicals.
Now, though, there are an increasing number of beauty brand incubators pumping out lines for famous people like Drew Barrymore and influencers like Kardashian hair dresser Jen Atkin, which I reported on recently for Business of Fashion. Until all the new rumored celebrity brands launch, we wonâ€™t know how theyâ€™ll be run, but theyâ€™ll probably fall into this category.
Itâ€™s sometimes very murky how a celebrityâ€™s ownership of a brand is structured, but itâ€™s often in the form of some sort of equity, and the celeb may be involved more authentically than they are with a spokesperson or licensing gig. They probably arenâ€™t sitting up late poring over spreadsheets or product formulations, but they have a lot of creative input and promote the brand extensively. But the parent company worries about finding ingredient suppliers and manufacturers and figures out how where theyâ€™re going to sell the brand.
For example, Kendo is the incubator behind Rihannaâ€™s Fenty Beauty. Itâ€™s owned by luxury conglomerate LVMH, which also owns brands like Christian Dior and Sephora, where Fenty is sold exclusively, except in countries where there are no Sephora stores. Itâ€™s never been revealed what stake Rihanna holds in the brand, but itâ€™s likely that LVMH owns more. LVMH also just gave Rihanna her own high end fashion line, where a jacket goes for $1,200. Her Savage x Fenty lingerie line is owned by a different company altogether. Rihanna is very good at selling things.
There is also a network of smaller behind-the-scenes companies producing brands for famous people and stores. Maesa developed Flower, which Drew Barrymore launched at Walmart in 2013, as well as Eva Mendesâ€™s short-lived Circa beauty, sold at Walgreens. Salma Hayek had a brand at CVS called Nuance, which was discontinued in 2017; a branding company called Hatchbeauty developed it. Florence by Mills and Tracee Ellis Rossâ€™ Pattern were both developed by Beach House Group, which did not respond to requests for an interview. Beach House also makes Kendall Jennerâ€™s oral care line Moon. (Yes, Kendall Jenner has an oral care line.)
Since the Khroma mess, Kylie and Kim have launched their own beauty businesses. Theyâ€™re produced by the same company, Seed Beauty, that manufactures the popular Colourpop makeup line. According to a 2017 report in trade paper WWD, Seed does not own any equity in Kylieâ€™s business. There were rumors at one point that Coty, a large conglomerate, had its eye on buying Kylie Cosmetics.

The model that requires the most work and financial risk for a celebrity is the one that Jessica Alba and Lady Gaga took on. They hired a management team, have boards, and sought out funding, just like any number of beauty brand founders who have not been on magazine covers. In fact, one venture capital firm, Lightspeed Ventures, seems to believe in the celebrity founder model. It has invested in Haus, Goop, and the Honest Company. Alba has likely learned a ton about the pitfalls of the beauty and personal care business. The company has had its share of problems, including product recalls and losing a potentially lucrative sale to Unilever.
Itâ€™s too early to say whether or not Lady Gagaâ€™s brand will stand the test of time. But according to her team, at least, sheâ€™s personally all-in. â€œShe is involved every day in the formulation, in the packaging, in the marketing. She has boards up on easels all around her kitchen,â€ says Yanover. â€œSheâ€™s contributed more in this one year than Iâ€™ve seen people contribute in 5 years at startups.â€
Who will succeed and who will fail?
The downward trajectory of celebrity fragrances shows us what happens when shoppers get sick of a category. The once-hot celebrity fragrance category started tanking around the 2008 recession, according to a 2017 BBC report. Yes, a new generation of artists like Ariana Grande are still pumping them out, but theyâ€™re not the go-tos they once were. Only three celebrities currently appear on market research company Euromonitorâ€™s ranking of global fragrance sales: Britney Spears (102), Liz Taylor (92), and surprise winner Antonio Banderas (54).
â€œThe catalyst for [celebrity fragranceâ€™s decline] was social media. As it proliferated, there was less need for this entrance to the celebrity world, which is what celebrity fragrance used to be,â€ says Hannah Symons, the head of beauty and personal care at Euromonitor. â€œThe idea that a fragrance would let you live like them, be like them, was less necessary.â€
Youâ€™ll maybe recall that Rihanna and Lady Gaga once had fragrances, too. Symons explains that fragrances werenâ€™t necessarily representative of a celebrityâ€™s lifestyle, whereas a full beauty line, if done correctly, can be. Rihanna championing people of all skin tones is in line with her personal ethos. Lady Gaga wearing elaborate curlicue face stickers is also highly on-brand. Tracee Ellis Ross selling hair care for curly hair makes a lot of sense.
But as Salma Hayek and Eva Mendes demonstrated, success is not guaranteed. Perhaps they were before their time, or maybe people didnâ€™t buy their drugstore positioning. Tyra Banks also had a makeup brand called Tyra Beauty, sold via multi-level marketing, which shuttered in 2017 after less than 3 years, as MLMs have become more scrutinized and criticized. Gabrielle Union had a hair care brand called Flawless that seems to be in limbo.

It ultimately comes down to whether or not customers buy the message, both literally and figuratively. Will they believe that Michelle Pfeiffer has always cared deeply about fragrances without potentially toxic chemicals in them? (The actress wasnâ€™t on Instagram until right before her fragrance range debuted.) Will they see Kendall Jenner as an icon of white teeth? (It didnâ€™t work when she tried to shill Proactiv.) Is Millie Bobby Brown qualified to demonstrate face washing? (She probably is just learning herself.)
Rutledge, the media psychologist, thinks Brown should have gone the traditional route and fronted a brand like Clinique for a while to establish her skin care credibility before launching her own line.
â€œThis pretend face washing was a huge mistake. People put up with a lot with celebs that they love, but no one likes to be manipulated. That triggers an innate defensive action,â€ she says. So far Brown seems to have enough fan goodwill, though it is too early to tell how long the line, which is sold at Gen Z favorite Ulta, will last.
Symons thinks the Kardashian-Jenner empire will topple. â€œThey are just very good at jumping on all trends. I donâ€™t see that any of them will have any longevity, to be honest. Weâ€™ve already seen results of Kylieâ€™s empire slow,â€ she says.
Meanwhile, CAAâ€™s Yanover expects to see more entrants, along with more flubs. â€œI see more of it happening, but a lot of people are going to do it without knowing what theyâ€™re doing and theyâ€™re going to mess it up.â€

"The Democratic Party has moved to the left on issues such as health care, college, and taxes on the wealthy. Now some Democratic candidates are trying to get the party to do the same on guns.
But divisions on just how far the party should go were on display when nine leading Democratic presidential candidates talked about containing gun violence at an MSNBC forum on Wednesday.
The candidates still agreed on a lot. They talked up universal background checks, repeating the words â€œcommon senseâ€ again and again. An assault weapons ban got wide support, with candidates decrying â€œweapons of war in the streets.â€ So did more research into gun violence, closing loopholes in existing firearm laws, and better enforcement of those laws.
When Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) was asked about gun licensing, though, he launched into an impassioned case for Democrats going further on this issue than they have in the past. And he criticized candidates who didnâ€™t support a federal licensing system â€” a shot, seemingly, at former Vice President Joe Biden.
â€œYou should not be a nominee from our party that can seriously stand in front of urban places and say, â€˜I will protect you,â€™ if you donâ€™t believe in gun licensing,â€ Booker said, pointing to polls showing that more than 70 percent of Americans support licensing.
Booker also took aim at former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke (D-TX), who initially said Bookerâ€™s plan to enact a federal licensing system â€œmay be too farâ€ and didnâ€™t explicitly support licensing â€” until a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, led him to get much more aggressive on guns.
â€œBeto Oâ€™Rourke was not for gun licensing, criticized me when I came out for it,â€ Booker said. â€œHe saw the horrors visiting his community. Are we going to have to wait until Hellâ€™s lottery comes to your community?â€
Oâ€™Rourke later commended Booker for his leadership and rebuffed the criticism, saying, â€œthis is not a moment to seek division.â€
Gun violence is a problem of growing importance for Democrats. Before the debates, Democratic survey respondents said gun violence is a top issue they want to hear about. There were nearly 40,000 gun deaths in America in 2017 â€” a 50-year high. The US suffers nearly four times the rate of gun deaths as that of Switzerland, five times that of Canada, 35 times that of the United Kingdom, and 53 times that of Japan.
Thereâ€™s wide agreement on policies like universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, but thereâ€™s much less agreement on proposals like a federal licensing system and a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons â€” in part because some candidates donâ€™t believe that these programs could be enacted or could work.
Democrats agree on universal background checks and an assault weapons ban
Every candidate on the stage Wednesday agreed on two policies: universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.
This reflects a status quo going back more than two decades. In the 1990s, a Democratic-controlled Congress passed federal background checks and a 10-year assault weapons ban. Since then, Democratic efforts on guns have focused on building on the background check system â€” to make it apply to more gun sales, such as private transfers â€” and renewing the assault weapons ban.
Both ideas are fairly popular. According to Pew Research Center surveys, a majority of both Democrats and Republicans support universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. It was not uncommon for Democratic candidates to note on Wednesday that universal background checks have support from 90-plus percent of Americans.
Several other issues received wide support: â€œred flagâ€ laws that would let courts take guns away from people deemed dangerous, urban violence prevention programs, more federally funded research into gun violence, closing some of the loopholes in existing gun laws, and better enforcement of those laws.
There is significant disagreement on whether these policies are sufficient. In response to questions about whether their plans go far enough, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pointed to the politics: If Congress has not been able to pass even universal background checks, is it really realistic to promise more â€” and should other measures that can already pass be held up until more can be done?
â€œI donâ€™t want to hold things up and get caught up in false fights,â€ Biden said. â€œI want to get things done in the meantime.â€
Booker, pointing to the polling on bolder policies like gun licensing, said that Americans are already there. As he and other candidates pointed out, the hurdle isnâ€™t public support but getting Congress to stop fearing the sway of the National Rifle Association and single-issue gun rights voters.
â€œDo not let the fearmongers dictate our policy,â€ Booker said.
Underpinning this debate is some of the more current evidence on gun policies. Some of the recent research on universal background checks has been mixed, and studies on the last assault weapons ban found it ineffective for reducing overall levels of gun violence, in part because the great majority of gun deaths involve handguns, not assault weapons. That suggests that to truly get levels of gun violence down, the next Congress and president will have to go further.
Thereâ€™s more division on gun licensing
Some candidates argue that the next step is to require a license to own and buy a firearm. Booker has made the case repeatedly: â€œIf you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to own a gun.â€
Booker cited studies showing that licensing systems reduce gun violence. In Connecticut, Missouri, and urban counties, a licensing system was associated with fewer gun deaths â€” both homicides and suicides. The licensing system in Massachusetts is cited by experts as one of the primary reasons the state has the lowest gun death rate in the US.
The candidates generally seem favorable to licensing. Where thereâ€™s division â€” and where Booker seemingly called Biden out â€” is whether the system should be federal or state by state. Booker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, among others, include in their plans a federal system that would require a license to buy and own a gun. But Bidenâ€™s plan doesnâ€™t; it would financially incentivize states to adopt their own licensing systems, meaning states could choose not to do so.
In defending his proposal, Biden flipped the rhetoric often used by Booker to argue for licensing, pointing out that driverâ€™s licenses are implemented at the state level. â€œTheyâ€™re state licenses,â€ Biden said. â€œYou donâ€™t need a federal license to drive a car.â€
Booker argued that this would fail to solve the full problem. He pointed out that in states with stronger gun laws, most of the firearms used in crimes come from states with much weaker laws. In 2017, half of guns traced by police in Boston had out-of-state origins and less than a quarter came from within the state (the rest had unconfirmed origins). The same trend â€” or worse â€” has been found elsewhere, from Chicago to New York to Mexico.
â€œIf you do not have a federal licensing program, this is what youâ€™re creating,â€ Booker said. â€œWeâ€™ve created a system where youâ€™re only as safe as the state near you with the least restrictive gun laws.â€
Biden, however, seems skeptical of licensing. When Booker first released his plan, Biden said that â€œgun licensing will not change whether or not people buy what weapons â€” what kinds of weapons they can buy, where they can use them, how they can store them.â€ Thatâ€™s contradicted by the research on licensing, but it helps explain why Biden isnâ€™t willing to go much further.
Democrats sharply disagree on a mandatory buyback for assault weapons
The biggest divide at the forum came when Democrats discussed mandatory buyback programs. Out of the nine candidates who attended, only three â€” Booker, Oâ€™Rourke, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) â€” vowed support for a mandatory buyback program.
The idea: An assault weapons ban leaves millions of these weapons out there, so the US government needs to do something on top of the ban to get the weapons out of circulation.
As the first to speak at the event, Buttigieg warned Democrats about chasing the â€œshiny objectâ€ â€” of a mandatory buyback program â€” when they have a chance to do something about guns right now. It was a political case for avoiding a very controversial topic in gun policy: outright confiscation.
Other candidates have proposed a middle option. Bidenâ€™s plan, for instance, would institute a voluntary buyback program, but if gun owners donâ€™t give up their assault weapons, theyâ€™ll have to go through a background check and register the weapons â€” just like theyâ€™re already forced to do so with machine guns today.
Later on, Oâ€™Rourke criticized â€œthose who are worried about the polls and want to triangulate or talk to the consultants or listen to the focus groupsâ€ â€” calling out Buttigieg in particular. He pointed to a poll that found a majority of voters back a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons. â€œThe polls, if you need them, support this,â€ Oâ€™Rourke argued.
Buttigieg had previously argued that the evidence for buyback programs in the US has been mixed, often producing guns that were already defective. But American buyback programs have also been voluntary.
Mandatory buybacks â€” which are effectively confiscation schemes â€” have been tried with more success in other countries. A mandatory buyback program in Australia, paired with a ban on automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, was linked to drops in homicides and suicides.
But even if a mandatory buyback for assault weapons were implemented in the US, itâ€™s not clear that it would do much to reduce gun violence. Shootings with rifles, including assault rifles, make up less than 3 percent of gun homicides in the US. More than 70 percent of gun homicides are instead carried out with handguns â€” which would be largely neglected by a plan to ban and confiscate only assault weapons.
Still, there is some evidence that restricting access to assault weapons might reduce the lethality of mass shootings.
For now, though, Democrats are deeply divided on the issue."
"President Donald Trump defended himself against allegations that he made an improper request of a foreign leader at the White House Wednesday by continuing to attack the whistleblower who made them.
â€œThis country has to find out who this person was, because that personâ€™s a spy, in my opinion,â€ the president said during an Oval Office press conference with the president of Finland, arguing only â€œlegitimateâ€ whistleblowers ought to be protected by whistleblower laws.
Many of the presidentâ€™s latest attacks have taken this form, marking an evolution from his early attempts to discredit the whistleblowerâ€™s allegations to more pointed and personal attacks on the whistleblower himself and his anonymity.
In the course of his attacks, the president has also attempted to cast doubt on the impeachment inquiry the allegations have led to in the House of Representatives. Now his critics argue his threats could have a chilling effect â€” as well as potentially endangering the whistleblower.
Trumpâ€™s claims about the whistleblowerâ€™s illegitimacy have no provable connection to reality. But experts say there are real fears his actions will keep federal employees from speaking out about future acts of concern, in large part because while there are measures in federal law meant to negate retaliation against whistleblowers, they do not apply to the president.
Trump has worked to seed doubt about the whistleblowerâ€™s accuracy â€” and the whistleblowing process
Following the first news reports about the whistleblowerâ€™s complaint in early September, Trump referred to the official as â€œhighly partisanâ€ and a â€œso-called whistleblowerâ€ on Twitter. But after the complaint was made public, the president began a more nuanced attack: casting doubt on the whistleblowerâ€™s accuracy.
The whistleblowerâ€™s complaint states he sourced his allegations from a number of federal officials with firsthand knowledge of a conversation Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he admits he was not himself on the call. The inspector general took this into account and conducted his own investigation into the allegations, deemed the complaint credible, of great import, and eventually told Congress members it â€œrelates to one of the most significant and important of the [director of national intelligenceâ€™s] responsibilities to the American people.â€
Trumpâ€™s own administration has complicated the presidentâ€™s argument by releasing a memo summarizing his call with Zelensky that confirms the central allegation contained in the complaint.
But Trump, nevertheless, has attempted to frame the allegations as little more than gossip, saying they are â€œall second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate.â€
Heâ€™s also impugned not just the whistleblowerâ€™s information, but the entire whistleblower process.
Following the publication of an article by conservative outlet that incorrectly claimed intelligence officials had changed whistleblowing regulations shortly before the Ukraine whistleblower filed his complaint, Trump tweeted Monday, â€œWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES ... ?â€
This rule change did not happen, as national security lawyer and whistleblower expert Brad Moss explained to Vox: â€œThe law doesnâ€™t prohibit [secondhand information] â€” in fact the laws have never prohibited that, when it comes to the initial whistleblower.â€
The presidentâ€™s tweet, and the article, led the intelligence community inspector general to release a statement Monday afternoon that reaffirmed the inspector general did not, and cannot change the law, and that read in part, â€œIn fact, by law the Complainant ... need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern.â€
Nevertheless, the president and his allies have seized upon the rule change conspiracy theory to make the whistleblowing process seem rigged against him. And by impugning the process, they work to cheapen it â€” to say that if the rules governing it are mutable, then perhaps the facts presented in a complaint are less than solid as well.
All of this has prefaced the presidentâ€™s latest attacks against the whistleblower, and the ones his critics see as most dangerous: An assault not just against the whistleblowerâ€™s information or the process, but against the man personally.
Critics fear Trump will have a chilling effect on whistleblowing
Trump has made it clear he wants to know the whistleblowerâ€™s identity and Wednesday branded him â€œa spy.â€ He had previously told US staffers at the UN that whoever gave the whistleblower the information he used to compile his complaint was â€œalmost a spy.â€ And the president suggested that the US ought to think about reviving its old practice of executing spies.
This sort of rhetoric has Democrats and experts concerned Trumpâ€™s demands could endanger the whistleblower are doing real damage to the whistleblower system as a whole.
On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff â€” one of the leaders of the investigation into the whistleblowerâ€™s allegations â€” told reporters at a press conference that suggestions the whistleblower and his sources are â€œsomehow treasonous and should be treated as traitors and spiesâ€ were â€œa blatant effort to intimidate witnesses.â€ He also called such comments â€œan incitement to violence.â€
It is clear those who have alleged wrongdoing on the part of the president have faced physical violence in the past. Democrat and frequent Trump foil Rep. Ilhan Omar has spoken of a number of deaths threats she has received, for instance, and Cesar Sayoc was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing pipe bombs to some of Trumpâ€™s critics. Should the whistleblowerâ€™s name become public, he could face similar threats.
Previously, Schiff has argued dangers go beyond one individual, arguing the president is working towards the â€œcomplete breakdown of the whistleblower system and it intimidates other whistleblowers from coming forward.â€
In response to Trumpâ€™s words, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have put forward a resolution demanding Trump and his allies â€œimmediately must cease their public efforts to discredit the Whistleblower, as well as others who may have knowledge with respect to the allegations contained in the Complaint.â€
Experts have raised similar concerns. â€œAny federal employee who hears the reaction from the White House will think, â€˜If I blow the whistle, I will likely be subject to a personal attack,â€™â€ whistleblower lawyer and former Obama administration official Jason Zuckerman told the Washington Post.
Even Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who has pushed the presidentâ€™s talking points previously, called for levelheadedness on Tuesday, â€œThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowersâ€™ requests for confidentiality.â€
Trump is unlikely to be bothered by this subtle rebuke from Grassley. In fact, disregarding presidential norms by requesting Ukraine investigate Biden got the president into this mess. What worries some observers is that the president is completely within his powers to demand the identity of the whistleblower, and to call for retribution against him.

Whistleblower law is designed to protect people who make complaints â€” but not from the president
On Tuesday, Trump asked on Twitter, â€œWhy arenâ€™t we entitled to interview & learn everything about the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.â€
In general, the reason why is the law.
The Intelligence Authorization Act states:
No action constituting a reprisal, or threat of reprisal, for making such complaint or disclosing such information to the Inspector General may be taken by any employee in a position to take such actions, unless the complaint was made or the information was disclosed with the knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity.
Other regulations expand on these protections, like Presidential Policy Directive 19, which (among other things) states a whistleblower with access to classified information cannot have that access revoked in retribution for making a complaint. And the Inspector General Act of 1978 explains a whistleblowerâ€™s identity must be protected should they choose to stay anonymous (unless the inspector generalâ€™s investigation into the complaint requires it be revealed).
All of these protections are granted to a whistleblower, national security lawyer Brad Moss told Vox, as long as they â€œadhere to the strict parameters of what the law permits you to do, and not go beyond it.â€
The Ukraine whistleblower did all of these things, following the guidelines laid out in the law. Should he have done otherwise â€” say, by leaking his complaint to the press â€” Moss said, â€œthe law cannot protect you.â€
There is one issue with the law, however: It doesnâ€™t seem to apply to the president.
â€œThere really isnâ€™t much to stop Donald Trump from ordering the disclosure of the identity of the whistleblower,â€ Moss said. â€œHe himself is arguably beyond the scope of the legal restrictions. ... Any of those normal provisions donâ€™t really apply to the president because the president is the head of the executive branch ... so itâ€™s unlikely thereâ€™s any viable legal recourse that could be taken in that situation. The only recourse that is envisioned is political, and itâ€™s namely impeachment.â€
This places the Ukraine whistleblower â€” and any whistleblower â€” at risk. If Trump ordered his intelligence community inspector general to tell him the identity of the whistleblower, the inspector general would have to do so. And Trump could then tweet the whistleblowerâ€™s name, opening him up to all manner of harassment, and perhaps even physical danger.
It is unclear whether Trump is seriously considering ordering those in his administration aware of the whistleblowerâ€™s identity to reveal it. The whistleblower would likely hope the president respects his legal protections, although Trump is under no requirement to do so.
Ordinarily, a president might be expected to do everything in their power to protect a whistleblower, but Trump has never been one for presidential norms â€” in fact, disregarding them on his call with Zelensky is part of how he arrived at this political moment.

"Several American cities are rallying around a new response to the opioid epidemic: safe spaces for using heroin.
The concept has gained traction in New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and other cities across the US. The thinking is to allow supervised drug consumption sites where people can use drugs with sterile injection equipment and the supervision of trained staff, who are ready with the opioid overdose antidote naloxone if anything goes wrong. The sites may also link people to addiction treatment on request.
The idea: While in an ideal world, no one would use dangerous and potentially deadly drugs, many people do. So itâ€™s better to give these people a space where they can use drugs with some sort of supervision. Itâ€™s a harm reduction approach.
The US Department of Justice, under President Donald Trump, has become a vocal opponent of supervised consumption sites (also known as safe injection sites, medically supervised consumption sites, and many other names). This year, the Justice Department sued Safehouse, the nonprofit spearheading a safe injection site in Philadelphia, to stop it.
The Rehab Racket is Voxâ€™s investigation into Americaâ€™s notoriously opaque addiction treatment industry. Weâ€™re crowdsourcing patients and familiesâ€™ rehab stories, with an emphasis on the cost of treatment and quality of care. If youâ€™d like help our reporting by sharing your story, please fill out this survey.
On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that Philadelphiaâ€™s safe injection site did not violate federal law. The federal government argued that the site would violate the federal law by promoting illegal activity, citing the federal â€œcrackhouse statuteâ€ that targets properties where drugs are used. Safehouse argued its goal is, in fact, to help people who use drugs and over time get them to reduce risky behaviors and perhaps get into addiction treatment.
US District Judge Gerald McHugh agreed with Safehouse. â€œThe ultimate goal of Safehouseâ€™s proposed operation is to reduce drug use, not facilitate it,â€ he wrote in his opinion.
The move means Safehouse can, barring appeals, move forward with its plan. It also signals to other cities that their proposals for safe injection sites may be on sturdy legal ground too.
Advocates of safe injection sites argue they have the evidence on their side, citing some studies from sites in Canada, Australia, and Europe that found the sites can lead to major public health benefits.
Thereâ€™s a cultural battle, too. After decades of the war on drugs, much of Americaâ€™s drug policy is colored by a criminalized, stigmatized approach to addiction â€” one that demands shunning and shutting down all drug use, and trying to make sure that nothing is perceived as even remotely enabling or allowing drug use. Under this view, the idea of giving people a safe space to use drugs seems downright counterintuitive.
Now advocates are challenging the criminalized framing, arguing that if the goal is to save lives from addiction and overdose, a more compassionate approach is necessary.
In the middle of an opioid crisis, some cities are coming around to the new perspective. Drug overdose deaths in 2017 reached a record 70,000, around two-thirds of which were linked to opioids, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With the death toll mounting, policymakers are desperate for anything that may help.
Citiesâ€™ embrace of safe injection sites is triggering a broader culture war
Several cities have released plans to open a supervised consumption site, including New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle. Others, such as Denver and Ithaca, New York, are considering the sites. Itâ€™s not clear when any of these will open.
Itâ€™s worth noting, however, that none of these cities would be the first in the US to open a supervised drug consumption facility should they move forward with their plans, because unsanctioned facilities have been operating in the country for years. Some of the sites are makeshift, set up where people commonly use drugs. At least one, though, is secretly run by a harm reduction group that provides other kinds of services to people who use drugs â€” as has been documented by some studies.
One reason these older sites have never been officially sanctioned is public opposition. Thereâ€™s a widespread not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) sentiment with these kinds of services; essentially, people are worried that if a supervised consumption site opened in their area, it would attract people who use drugs to their neighborhood, and that could cause a rise in general crime and social disorder.
Critics also worry that supervised consumption sites would lead to more drug use, because they would remove a barrier â€” and perhaps some of the stigma â€” to drug use.
The Justice Department made this exact argument about Vermont: â€œSuch facilities would also threaten to undercut existing and future prevention initiatives by sending exactly the wrong message to children in Vermont: the government will help you use heroin. Indeed, by encouraging and normalizing heroin injection, [supervised consumption sites] may even encourage individuals to use opiates for the first time, or to switch their method of ingestion from snorting to injection, the latter carrying greatly increased risk of fatality and overdose.â€
Itâ€™s no coincidence that the Justice Department is making this argument. Law enforcement officials are some of the biggest opponents of supervised consumption facilities â€” and these officials can be particularly persuasive for politicians at the local and state level, where police hold a lot of sway over any policy related to public safety. In Philadelphia, for one, a key turning point seemed to be Police Commissioner Richard Ross going from being, as the Associated Press put it, â€œdead-setâ€ against supervised consumption sites to â€œkeeping an open mind if they can truly save lives.â€
Itâ€™s that reformed perspective â€” one focused on saving lives â€” that advocates of harm reduction and supervised consumption sites focus on. Itâ€™s not that the public and society should embrace or enable drug use or addiction, but that strategies should instead take people who use drugs seriously, listen to why theyâ€™re doing what theyâ€™re doing, and try to minimize the harms of what theyâ€™re doing as much as possible.
The argument: While ideally, people would not use drugs and those with addiction would get into treatment, the reality is that many people arenâ€™t ready to stop using. By meeting people where they are, governments and providers can mitigate some of the harms until someone is ready to stop using â€” and potentially save lives in the process.
So if people are at risk of transmitting HIV or hepatitis C through reused syringes, maybe a program can give them a supply of sterile needles so that they donâ€™t need to reuse syringes. If people are at risk of overdose, maybe a program can provide them with naloxone â€” or create a space where they can be supervised in case they overdose and need medical aid. In concert with these services, providers can also lay the groundwork for treatment in case people decide theyâ€™re ready for it.
Itâ€™s similar to the thinking around teen pregnancy: Perhaps parents would prefer that their teens donâ€™t have sex at a young age, but, acknowledging the reality that teens might, itâ€™s better to provide them condoms and other forms of birth control.
As Jonathan Giftos, an advocate and doctor focused on addiction, said on Twitter, â€œNo one is arguing that [supervised consumption sites] are THE answer to our overdose crisis, but they would fill an enormous gap in current care model â€” engaging a highly marginalized group of patients â€” and ultimately save many lives.â€
Accepting this view, however, requires rethinking how America approaches drugs. As Sarah Wakeman, an addiction medicine doctor and medical director at the Massachusetts General Hospital Substance Use Disorder Initiative, has told me, â€œFor 100-plus years as a society, weâ€™ve punished and criminalized people who use drugs.â€ The harm reduction view asks that America move away from that criminalized approach.
The evidence for safe injection sites is promising, but critics want more
Researchers have been looking into supervised consumption sites for decades (since the first one opened in Switzerland in 1986), with many positive findings so far. But critics arenâ€™t convinced that the evidence is very strong.
Drawing on more than a decade of studies, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in 2018 concluded that safe injection sites led to â€œsafer use for clientsâ€ and â€œwider health and public order benefits.â€ Among those benefits: reductions in risky behavior that can lead to HIV or hepatitis C transmission, drops in drug-related deaths and emergency service calls related to overdoses, and greater uptake in drug addiction treatment, including highly effective medications for opioid addiction.
Despite concerns that the facilities would draw more people who use drugs to an area and cause disorder, the research suggests, according to the EMCDDA, that these facilities lead to less public injecting and fewer syringes discarded in the area â€” both of which can benefit local communities. The facilities also werenâ€™t linked to higher crime in Sydney, Australia, or Vancouver, Canada â€” and, in fact, were linked to reduced street disorder and encounters with police.
â€œThese services facilitate rather than delay treatment entry and do not result in higher rates of local drug-related crime,â€ EMCDDA concluded.
A recent review of the evidence from the RAND Corporation was more cautious. RAND found that there arenâ€™t many well-conducted studies on safe injection sites, and the studies that do exist are too few and far between and have too many methodological constraints and weaknesses to reach hard conclusions about the sitesâ€™ overall effectiveness. â€œItâ€™s not that you canâ€™t learn anything from those studies,â€ Beau Kilmer, the lead author of RANDâ€™s report, told me. â€œBut you have to be really careful.â€
Still, even the RAND review found no evidence that supervised consumption sites lead to more crime and drug use, despite criticsâ€™ claims.
One problem with supervised consumption sites may come down to scale. The sites have limits in where and when theyâ€™re open, how many people they can serve at once, and whom they serve. For a city dealing with potentially thousands of people using drugs â€” many of whom use drugs multiple times a day â€” the sites donâ€™t have enough reach to help a lot of the population. Thatâ€™s particularly true for rural areas, where many people simply wonâ€™t be able to make an hours-long trip every time they want to use drugs.
So even though some studies have been done, critics and skeptics want more.
The US has a lot of room for improvement in its response to the opioid crisis
Beyond supervised consumption sites, thereâ€™s a lot the US could do to combat the opioid crisis.
At the top of those other things is treatment â€” specifically, medications like methadone and buprenorphine. There are decades of evidence behind these medications, showing that they reduce the mortality rate among opioid addiction patients by half or more and keep people in treatment better than other approaches. When France relaxed restrictions on doctors prescribing buprenorphine in response to its own opioid crisis in 1995, the number of people in treatment rose and overdose deaths fell by 79 percent over the following four years.
But these medications, and addiction treatment in general, remain largely inaccessible in the US. A 2016 surgeon general report concluded that only 10 percent of people with a substance use disorder get specialty treatment, in large part due to a lack of affordable and accessible treatment options. And even when treatment is available, other federal data suggests that fewer than half of treatment facilities offer opioid addiction medications.
The US could also do a lot more on the harm reduction front. Consider needle exchanges, where people can pick up sterile syringes and trade in used needles. The decades of research show needle exchanges combat the spread of bloodborne diseases like hepatitis C and HIV, cut down on the number of needles thrown out in public spaces and link more people to treatment â€” all without enabling more drug use.
Yet needle exchanges remain scarce in the US, as Josh Katz reported for the New York Times: â€œAccording to the North American Syringe Exchange Network, 333 such programs operate across the country, up from 204 in 2013. In Australia, a country with less than a tenth as many people, there are more than 3,000.â€
Then thereâ€™s a more controversial idea: prescription heroin sites.
The idea behind these: Some people struggling with addiction are going to use heroin no matter what. For whatever reason, traditional therapies just arenâ€™t going to work for them â€” just like some treatments for, say, heart disease or cancer donâ€™t work for some patients. So if that happens, itâ€™s better to give them a safe source of the drug theyâ€™re seeking and a safe place to inject it, rather than letting them pick it up on the street â€” laced with who knows what â€” and possibly overdose without medical supervision.
Researchers credit the European prescription heroin programs with better health outcomes, reductions in drug-related crimes, and improvements in social functioning, such as stabilized housing and employment. Canadian studies also deemed prescription heroin effective for treating heavy heroin use. A review of the research â€” which included randomized controlled trials from Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Canada, and the UK â€” reached similar conclusions, noting sharp drops in street heroin use among people in the treatment.
The RAND review of the evidence also found solid support for prescription heroin sites, which actually had a much stronger evidence base than supervised consumption sites.
There is no prescription heroin program in the US.
Advocates of supervised consumption sites, though, argue that safe injection facilities provide a unique opportunity that other policy interventions do not.
For example, someone who uses heroin may have had bad experiences with the criminal justice system or health care system in the past. That may make him skeptical of going to these institutions â€” or any other official institutions â€” for help. A supervised consumption site, though, can be different, since itâ€™s an environment in which people are less judgmental about drug use. If the people running supervised consumption sites take advantage of this, they could use their better stature with people who use drugs to guide them to treatment and recovery.
Thereâ€™s some research, as the EMCDDA found, that supervised consumption sites can do this. But more evidence is needed, skeptics and critics argue.
But as tens of thousands die of drug overdoses a year, some local policymakers are desperate to find solutions. So despite the federal opposition, theyâ€™re moving ahead with supervised consumption sites."
"On Tuesday, Federal District Court Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that Harvardâ€™s race-conscious admissions process is fair, and that it doesnâ€™t discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
On the surface, the ruling is a huge win for affirmative action, as it upholds the universityâ€™s practice of considering a personâ€™s race in the application process to create a more diverse student body. But the plaintiffs â€” an anonymous group of Asian Americans who were rejected from Harvard â€” have argued that Harvard caps the number of spots available to Asian students like them. Interestingly, the organization representing them is led by a white man. So yeah, itâ€™s complicated.
The plaintiffs are planning to appeal the case, and if it ends up in front of the US Supreme Court, conservative justices like Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh might end up outlawing affirmative action altogether.
Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard largely focused on whether Harvard violated the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against Asian Americans. This question was not directly connected to affirmative action, which was established as a way to weigh the applications of marginalized groups (such as women or people of color) in school admissions, job applications, and other areas where they have been historically shut out. But with the case almost guaranteed to be appealed to the Supreme Court, the questions that it deals with could have a huge impact on school programs meant to increase racial diversity, and could even make them illegal.
During the trial, which began last October, the plaintiffs argued that the only way to truly ensure that Asian Americans stand an equal chance in admissions is if race is completely removed from the process. The university disagreed, saying that there is no cap on Asian students and that its â€œholisticâ€ admissions process is necessary to ensure a diverse student body and does not discriminate against Asian American students.
Judge Burroughs sided with the university.
â€œAt least for now, ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race conscious admissions,â€ Burroughs wrote in her decision.
The trial raised complicated questions about the meaning of academic merit, and what that should mean when we think about race in college admissions. For Asian Americans, the case has also revealed significant divisions in support for affirmative action, making it clear that the demographic can hardly be treated as a monolith.
â€œThe courtâ€™s ruling today confirmed what the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld: affirmative action policies expand equal educational opportunity for all people of color, including Asian Americans, and are legal,â€ said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
Plaintiffs said Harvard limited the number of Asian Americans on campus
In November 2014, Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) filed its lawsuit, alleging that Harvard is â€œemploying racially and ethnically discriminatory policies and procedures in administering the undergraduate admissions programâ€ that are biased against Asian American applicants.
The plaintiffs said internal data shows Asian American applicants are rated lower on personal metrics, despite outperforming white applicants in other areas. SFFA argued that Harvard effectively uses a quota to cap the percentage of Asian American admissions, and that the school engages in â€œracial balancingâ€ to maintain a certain racial breakdown on campus.
To fix this, SFFA argued that Harvard, and ultimately all colleges, should no longer consider race in its admissions process, and that Supreme Court rulings in support of affirmative action have â€œbeen built on mistakes of fact and law.â€
Harvard has defended its â€œholistic reviewâ€ process that individually assesses each applicant and considers a number of factors, including academics, extracurriculars, and personal factors, with the goal of making each class diverse. The university says that while race is one of the many factors considered for assembling a class, it is never used against an applicant, nor is it a deciding factor for any applicant.
A white man created the group that sued
Identifying the plaintiffs in this trial is a bit complicated. SFFA represents a group of anonymous Asian American plaintiffs rejected from Harvard. The individual plaintiffs said they are remaining anonymous to avoid harassment for their part in the lawsuit.
Because of this, the public face of the trial was Edward Blum, a white, 66-year-old legal strategist. Blum leads the Project on Fair Representation, a group founded in 2005 to â€œsupport litigation that challenges racial and ethnic classifications and preferences in state and federal courts.â€ Blum also created SFFA to â€œrestore the original principles of our nationâ€™s civil rights movementâ€ by completely eliminating the use of race in college admissions. In addition to Harvard, the group is suing the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill on similar grounds.

Blum is known in legal circles for his efforts to get cases before the Supreme Court, all of them involving race in one way or another. In 1995, he was part of a group that brought Bush v. Vera before the court, successfully convincing the court to redraw several majority-minority electoral districts in Texas. He was also instrumental in Shelby County v. Holder, the case that gutted a key portion of the Voting Rights Act in 2013.
But Blum is perhaps best known for his work with Abigail Fisher, a white woman who argued in a pair of Supreme Court Cases in 2013 and 2016 that she was denied a spot at the University of Texas Austin due to her race.
Hereâ€™s how Blum described his work to Mother Jones in 2016:
Blum insists he is fighting for civil rights, and he is adamant that heâ€™s not just seeking white plaintiffs with racial axes to grind. â€œGroups like mine are not looking for Donald Trump-type supporters. We are looking for people who have honest, levelheaded opinions about equal representation. We reject people who are anti-immigrant. We reject people who are anti-Muslim. We reject people who have an antithetical view of American civil rights laws.â€ He says his efforts to find plaintiffs are no different from what civil rights groups and â€œthe marriage equality peopleâ€ do.
Blumâ€™s open desire to end any consideration of race in college admissions, coupled with his action on other race-related court cases, has led his critics to argue that he is using Asian Americans as a prop to strike down affirmative action.
The case stirred racial resentment
Up until now, most cases about race in college admissions have been brought by white plaintiffs like Fisher, who argue that they are harmed by â€œreverse discriminationâ€ and therefore pushed out of colleges by less-qualified applicants of color. Those cases have led to restrictions in how affirmative action can be used, but no case has actually ended the practice in its entirety.
If the Harvard case goes to the Supreme Court, it could change this. Rather than a white plaintiff, this case relies on a group of high-achieving Asian Americans arguing that a policy meant to help students of color is actually hurting them. Unlike Fisher, whose GPA and SAT scores were not as strong as her peers, the plaintiffs in this case have academic records that are much harder to criticize.
An appeal could have a drastic effect on how elite schools use race in admissions â€” especially since last summer, the Trump administration rescinded Obama-era guidance on race in admissions, urging schools to adopt a race-neutral approach. The Department of Justice also filed a statement of interest siding with the plaintiffs in this case, arguing that Harvard â€œfailed to show that it does not unlawfully discriminate against Asian Americans.â€
The Trump administrationâ€™s involvement has made it clear that it sees discrimination against Asian Americans as something to solve by eliminating any consideration of race at all. With a solid conservative majority now in place following Brett Kavanaughâ€™s confirmation to the Supreme Court, there is concern that if this case makes it to the court, it will end affirmative action entirely.
Other colleges have been accused of the same thing
The Harvard case is not the first time that a college was accused of discriminating against Asian American students. In the 1980s, student activists noticed that Asian American college admission rates remained stagnant despite a rapid increase in the number of college-aged Asian Americans. They argued that the stagnation was largely due to biased admissions practices that kept the number of admitted Asian Americans relatively low, while favoring white applicants.
The complaints led to internal investigations of admissions practices at schools including Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, and the University of California Berkeley. While some schools, like Berkeley, maintained that they did nothing wrong and that Asian American students were overrepresented relative to their share of the general US population, Stanford acknowledged that unconscious bias may have played a role in its process.
When the Reagan administration addressed the allegations of discrimination against Asian Americans in the late 1980s, it ignored that much of the claimed discrimination may have benefitted white students, instead arguing that the biggest hurdle affecting Asian American applicants was the affirmative action programs aimed at helping racial minorities. As Voxâ€™s Alvin Chang notes, Asian American students accused the Reagan administration of â€œracial mascoting.â€ Affirmative action is now often framed as hurting Asian-American college applicants.
Civil rights groups like the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund say this framing pits Asian Americans against other minorities and also ignores how affirmative action benefits those from less-represented Asian American and Pacific Islander subgroups. Research from academics Karthick Ramakrishnan and Janelle Wong has shown that most Asian Americans support affirmative action, although support has dropped off considerably among Chinese Americans.
Data shows that Asian American students are overrepresented at many of Americaâ€™s most selective schools. At Harvard, for example, Asian American students were roughly 22 percent of those admitted in 2017 but Asian Americans were just 5 percent of the population.
Some observers, such as Yale Lawâ€™s Amy Chua, say that the success of Asian American students is largely due to cultural reasons, an argument that has often been used to frame Asian Americans as a â€œmodel minority.â€ But in 2014, a pair of California researchers found that Asian American studentsâ€™ high level of achievement was more likely due to students having better access to resources and living and studying in close proximity to other high achievers due to a concerted effort by their families.
This isnâ€™t to say that Asian Americans face zero bias in college admissions. Under the Obama administration, a Department of Education investigation into allegations of racial bias at Princeton, for example, revealed that admissions officers referred to Asian American applicants as â€œstandard premedsâ€ and â€œfamiliar profiles.â€
The Education Department ultimately conceded that the admissions officers made comments â€œassociated with Asian stereotypes,â€ but noted that similarly stereotypical comments were made about black and white applicants as well. The agency ultimately determined that the school did not discriminate against Asian American applicants and that race was not a deciding factor in the admissions process.

SFFA said it has found evidence that proves Harvard is deliberately (and illegally) limiting the number of Asian Americans accepted, pointing to a part of Harvardâ€™s holistic review process known as the â€œpersonal rating.â€ This part of the application process considers things like teacher recommendations, alumni interviews, and personal statements.
The plaintiffs say internal reports from Harvardâ€™s Office of Institutional Research suggest the university regularly underscored Asian-American applicants on this portion of the review. They say Harvard regularly rated Asian Americans as less â€œcourageousâ€ or â€œless â€œlikableâ€ than white students, and admitted more whites than Asian Americans, despite Asian Americans besting whites on the other metrics.
Harvard countered that the reports were incomplete and did not fully capture the nuance of the schoolâ€™s admissions process, and has said that weaker teacher recommendations are behind Asian American studentsâ€™ lower personal ratings. Both sides presented dueling expert analyses over the data.
In the end, the judge ruled that Harvardâ€™s actions were not discriminatory.
The controversy over affirmative action, explained
President John F. Kennedy established affirmative action programs for government contractors by executive order in 1961 to advance the goals of â€œnondiscriminationâ€ within society at large. As the New Yorkerâ€™s Hua Hsu writes, the government did not create detailed guidelines on where or how affirmative action should be used. But as legal cases challenging affirmative action in college admissions increased in the 1970s, that became the main way the issue was discussed.
In some ways, framing affirmative action as problematic in college admissions isnâ€™t entirely fair, and the conversation largely revolves around a small number of the most selective schools in America. At elite schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, admissions officers argue that given the limited number of black and Hispanic applicants to elite colleges, being able to consider race is the only way that these schools can maintain a racially diverse student body.
The schools also argue that basing decisions solely on grades and test scores would be impossible. In a legal filing submitted before the trial, Harvard officials said the school received more than 37,000 applications for roughly 2,000 spots in the class of 2019.
The university said more than 8,000 of those applicants had perfect grades, and more than 5,000 had a perfect math or verbal SAT score. Considering things like a studentâ€™s extracurriculars, volunteer work, and race in addition to their grades, the school argued, is necessary to achieve a more diverse class than it could get through test scores alone.
The plaintiffs said this argument â€” plus internal Harvard reports that suggest the numbers of black and Hispanic students admitted to the school would drop significantly if the university were forced to change its admissions system â€” is proof that less-qualified students are getting in due to their race.
That counterargument gets at an issue that has long animated debates over affirmative action. Some say acknowledging an applicantâ€™s race automatically means penalizing another more qualified applicant for being of a different race. Critics of Harvardâ€™s policies argue that affirmative action programs create an unfair system of rewards and penalties in which black and Hispanic applicants win, and white and Asian American applicants lose.

But for Harvard and the civil rights groups defending its admissions policy, being able to consider race â€” even if it is just limited to Justice Kennedyâ€™s â€œfactor of a factor of a factorâ€ framing â€” is necessary to ensure that students of color continue to make it to Harvard and similar schools.
Their claims are supported by data: A 2017 New York Times analysis found that even with race-conscious admissions policies in place, black and Hispanic students are actually less represented at Americaâ€™s top colleges now than they were 35 years ago. The analysis notes that Asian American students have been the demographic with the most growth at many of these top universities.
It is that last point that so strongly triggers the emotional response to this case. Harvard and other elite schools are considered the best in America, where connections and a diploma can open up doors that can drastically change oneâ€™s future. The debate over who gets into Harvard is about more than the importance of test scores â€” it is about who has access to Americaâ€™s elite institutions in an age when power is increasingly held by a select few."
"MSNBC, along with advocacy groups March for Our Lives and Giffords, will host a six-hour gun violence forum with nine of the 10 leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday, starting at 10 am Pacific time.
You can live stream the forum at NBC News Now or MSNBC.com, which wonâ€™t require a cable login. Parts of it will also air on MSNBC.
Hereâ€™s the currently planned schedule for each candidate:
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10 am PT
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro at 10:30 am PT
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey at 11 am PT
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 11:30 am PT
Break at noon PT
Former Vice President Joe Biden at 1 pm PT
Former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke of Texas at 1:30 pm PT
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at 2 pm PT
Businessperson Andrew Yang at 3:15 pm PT
Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 3:45 pm PT
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was originally scheduled for 2:45 pm PT, but he canceled all campaign events until further notice after he was hospitalized. A Giffords spokesperson said it might move one of the candidates scheduled later in the event to fill Sandersâ€™s slot and end the forum earlier than expected.
The audience will be made up of 300 people who obtained tickets. MSNBC Live anchor Craig Melvin will field most of the questions, but some will also come from Giffords and March for Our Lives, asked by gun violence survivors and policy advocates.
As mass shootings like El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have received more attention, gun violence and policy have become more central to the 2020 campaigns. Before the debates, Democratic survey respondents put gun violence as one of the top issues they want to hear about. There were nearly 40,000 gun deaths in the US in 2017.
For much of the past 25 years, Democrats have typically responded to these issues with calls for universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and better enforcement of existing gun laws.
But thereâ€™s a growing push for Democrats to go further. March for Our Lives released a â€œPeace Planâ€ that backs, on top of the Democratic mainstays, a requirement to obtain a license to buy and own a firearm as well as a mandatory buyback program â€” effectively, confiscation â€” for assault weapons. And a growing body of research suggests universal background checks and an assault weapons ban by themselves wouldnâ€™t do much to reduce gun violence, while licensing would make a more serious impact on gun deaths.
Some Democrats have answered the demands with more aggressive gun policy platforms. Booker led the charge with a plan that includes licensing. Warren released a plan including licensing that promises to revisit the issue of guns annually, with an explicit goal of getting gun deaths down 80 percent. Buttigieg, Yang, and others have released similar proposals.
Meanwhile, Oâ€™Rourke drew days of national media attention when, at the last debate, he said he wanted to not just ban assault weapons but also confiscate the firearms from gun owners: â€œHell yes, weâ€™re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.â€ He wasnâ€™t the first to call for this â€” Rep. Eric Swalwell of California did when he was in the race, and Booker supports the idea â€” but he was perhaps the loudest to do so.
Not everyone has joined the call for bolder action. Biden, for one, has generally stuck to supporting universal background checks and an assault weapons ban â€” the same kinds of policy proposals he has been making on guns for 25 years, since as senator he helped pass federal background checks and a 10-year assault weapons ban in the 1990s. His plan only encourages states to adopt licensing, falling short of a federal system and letting states decline. Heâ€™s also criticized licensing, saying it â€œwill not change whether or not people buy what weapons â€” what kinds of weapons they can buy, where they can use them, how they can store them.â€
Given that the forum will follow a one-by-one interview format with the candidates, instead of a debate-style matchup, the candidates themselves wonâ€™t be able to confront each other on their differing views on licensing, confiscation, and so on. But perhaps Melvin and other questioners will; March for Our Lives in particular has been trying to get the 2020 candidates to back its â€œPeace Plan,â€ which would require a commitment to supporting gun licensing and a mandatory buyback for assault weapons.
Alternatively, the candidates could face questions about what else, besides gun control, theyâ€™re willing to do about gun violence. Some activist groups, including Giffords, have become more involved in urban violence reduction strategies in recent years.
But if nothing else, Wednesdayâ€™s forum will give the public a chance to see just how far the Democratic candidates are willing to go on guns.
For more on the 2020 candidatesâ€™ positions on guns, read Voxâ€™s explainer."
"Former Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled his gun violence plan, just hours before a forum in which he and nine other Democratic presidential candidates will discuss what they plan to do about the issue.
Bidenâ€™s plan is not as ambitious as that of other candidates in the race, but it would still amount to the largest changes to Americaâ€™s gun laws in more than two decades. It includes universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, more resources toward the enforcement of existing laws, a public push for the development of â€œsmart guns,â€ and incentives for states to adopt â€œred flagâ€ laws, which allow courts to confiscate guns from people deemed a risk to themselves or others and develop gun-licensing systems.
As part of the plan, Biden boasts that he has â€œtaken on the National Rifle Association (NRA) on the national stage and won â€” twice.â€ As a senator in 1993, Biden helped pass the federal background checks law that still stands today. The year after, the now-controversial crime bill Biden helped write included a 10-year assault weapons ban.
â€œItâ€™s within our grasp to end our gun violence epidemic and respect the Second Amendment, which is limited,â€ Bidenâ€™s campaign said. â€œAs president, Biden will pursue constitutional, common-sense gun safety policies.â€
As mass shootings like El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, have received more attention, gun violence and policy have become more central to the 2020 campaigns. Before the debates, Democratic survey respondents said gun violence is a top issue they want to hear about. There were nearly 40,000 gun deaths in the US in 2017 â€” a 50-year high.
Bidenâ€™s plan, however, doesnâ€™t go as far as other campaignsâ€™ proposals. Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, for example, have proposed a federal licensing system â€” one that would require everyone in the US to obtain a license to buy and own firearms. But Bidenâ€™s proposal only includes financial incentives for states to adopt licensing, which they could decline to do.
In the past, Biden has criticized the concept of licensing, saying it â€œwill not change whether or not people buy what weapons â€” what kinds of weapons they can buy, where they can use them, how they can store them.â€ The research has found licensing is among the more effective proposals for reducing gun deaths, more so than universal background checks or an assault weapons ban.
Bidenâ€™s plan also doesnâ€™t include, as Booker and Beto Oâ€™Rourke have called for, a mandatory buyback program â€” essentially, a confiscation scheme â€” for assault weapons. Instead, his plan has a voluntary buyback program through which gun owners can sell assault weapons. But if gun owners donâ€™t sell their assault weapons, theyâ€™ll have to go through a background check and register the weapons, just like theyâ€™re already forced to do so with machine guns today.
The proposal includes other ideas. It would close several loopholes in existing law. It would repeal a law that made it harder to sue gun manufacturers and sellers when they make or sell guns they should have known would be diverted to criminal uses. It would limit the number of guns an individual can purchase to one per month. It would require safe storage. It would finance strategies to combat urban violence in particular. It would fund more research into preventing gun violence. (For more specifics, read Bidenâ€™s full plan.)
Tougher gun laws are backed by the research. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence â€” a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.
The question, even for Bidenâ€™s plan, is how likely any of this is to pass. Even though many of the proposals are popular among both Democrats and Republicans, the reality is Congress hasnâ€™t moved even on universal background checks â€” an idea that, based on the polls, 80-plus percent of Americans support. In fact, Congress hasnâ€™t passed a major gun control law since the measures in 1993 and 1994 that Biden boasted about in his plan.
Perhaps thatâ€™s why Biden is taking the more moderate route, declining to support a federal licensing system or a mandatory buyback program. But itâ€™s unclear if even a moderate plan would pass â€” and research indicates it might not do much to actually reduce gun violence, anyway.
Bidenâ€™s plan shows a little movement on the issue of guns, but not much
In 1993 and 1994, a Democratic-controlled Congress passed federal background checks and a 10-year assault weapons ban. In the 25 years since, the debate has largely been relegated to â€¦ more background checks and an assault weapons ban. As the party has moved left on everything from single-payer health care to the Green New Deal to taxes on the wealthy, it hasnâ€™t really moved on guns.
Bidenâ€™s proposal includes a little movement â€” calling, in particular, for states to adopt â€œred flagâ€ laws and licensing systems. But the main pieces of his plan, especially since he stops short of calling for a federal licensing system, are still universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.
The research suggests that this isnâ€™t enough. Some of the recent research on universal background checks has been mixed, and studies on the last assault weapons ban found it ineffective for reducing overall levels of gun violence, in part because the great majority of gun deaths involve handguns not assault weapons. But studies on licensing have been very consistent in significantly reducing gun deaths â€” in urban counties, Connecticut, and Missouri, including for suicides.
A federal licensing system, then, would likely have a bigger impact than the Democratic gun control mainstays.
Even then, a licensing system alone wouldnâ€™t get the US down to the levels of gun violence seen in other developed nations. America leads the developed world in gun violence, with gun death rates nearly four times that of Switzerland, five times that of Canada, 35 times that of the United Kingdom, and 53 times that of Japan.
Thatâ€™s because Americaâ€™s problem is that it simply has too many guns. The US has far more guns than any other country in the world â€” more guns than people, according to the Small Arms Survey. That makes it easy to get a firearm, legally or not, leading to more gun deaths.
Research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Healthâ€™s Injury Control Research Center backs this up: After controlling for variables, such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths â€” not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings.
Another way to look at this: Everywhere in the world, people get into arguments. Every country has residents who are dangerous to themselves or others because of mental illness. Every country has bigots and extremists. But in America, itâ€™s uniquely easy for a person to obtain a gun, letting otherwise tense but nonlethal conflicts escalate into deadly violence.
Even the boldest Democratic proposals wonâ€™t do much to significantly reduce the number of guns in the US, at least in the short or medium term. (Any restrictions could, of course, reduce the number of gun owners over the long term.) Quicker action would likely require wider bans on firearms â€” potentially all semiautomatic weapons or all handguns â€” and coupling that with an Australian-style mandatory buyback program, which studies support.
But no Democrat is going that far. That reflects the political reality, given that Congress so far hasnâ€™t taken up even the milder gun control proposals. And Democrats worry courts would just strike down tougher laws or that stronger measures could lead to a backlash that gets Democrats kicked out of office, like the 1994 assault weapons ban is blamed for.
Yet as long as all of that remains true, there will be little voice on the presidential stage to the kinds of policies that could get American gun violence down to the levels of the USâ€™s developed peers.
For more on the Democratic presidential candidatesâ€™ gun proposals, read Voxâ€™s explainer."
"The Democratic debates have crystallized how far Democrats have moved to the left on all sorts of issues over the past few years. Candidates for the presidency advocated for single-payer health care, a Green New Deal, free college, 70 percent taxes on the ultrawealthy, decriminalizing crossing the border without papers, and upholding â€œreproductive justice.â€
But thereâ€™s one issue, even as itâ€™s gotten more attention, where major Democratic politicians havenâ€™t moved much: guns. At the debates, most candidates raised the same ideas theyâ€™ve had for decades: universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and keeping guns away from dangerous people. Only a few were active in calls to push further, such as Cory Bookerâ€™s support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun â€” which some candidates have joined in â€” and Beto Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s promise that â€œhell yes, weâ€™re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.â€
If you want to make a serious dent in gun violence in the US, this should worry you. Just imagine a world where Democrats get everything leading candidates typically say they want on guns. Congress passes and President Elizabeth Warren signs a comprehensive bill that includes universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and a red-flag law that lets law enforcement take away guns from dangerous people.
It would be, to be sure, a massive political and policy victory â€” the culmination of decades of work by gun control advocates. The media would characterize it as a sea change in gun politics. The National Rifle Association and its Republican allies would be livid.
Yet it almost certainly would not be enough. We would still likely see mass shootings, like the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, on a regular basis, in addition to the incidents of suicides, urban violence, and domestic abuse that are tragically even more common.
Thatâ€™s because America would still have the weakest gun laws among developed nations, and it would still have the most firearms out of any country in the world â€” and the research has consistently found that places with more guns have more gun deaths.
The problem is dire: The US, with its enormous civilian-owned arsenal of guns, leads the developed world in gun violence. A 2018 study in JAMA found that the USâ€™s civilian gun death rate is nearly four times that of Switzerland, five times that of Canada, 35 times that of the United Kingdom, and 53 times that of Japan. There are, on average, more than 100 gun deaths in the US per day.
The typical proposals on guns pick at this problem but come nowhere close to solving it. Background checks can screen out some people from getting a gun, but recent studies suggest even universal background checks, on their own, donâ€™t have a big impact on gun deaths. An assault weapons ban could make some mass shootings less deadly but wouldnâ€™t address the 70-plus percent of firearm homicides that involve a handgun. A red flag law could help law enforcement take guns away from dangerous people but, by definition, these laws only work after red flags arise, which is often too late.
Gun control policies that donâ€™t confront the core issue â€” that America simply has too many guns â€” are doomed to merely nibble around the edges. Everywhere in the world, people get into arguments. Every country has residents who are dangerous to themselves or others because of mental illness. Every country has bigots and extremists. But here, itâ€™s uniquely easy for a person to obtain a gun, letting otherwise tense but nonlethal conflicts escalate into deadly violence.
To change the status quo, Democrats should go big. They need to focus on the abundance of guns in the US and develop a suite of policies that directly tackle that issue, from licensing to confiscation to more aggressive bans of certain kinds of firearms (including, perhaps, all semiautomatic weapons or at least some types of handguns).
I am not naive. I donâ€™t think that this would lead to sweeping Australian- or UK-style gun control legislation passing in 2021. But this broader conversation has to start somewhere.
The time is now. The NRA is in chaos, as its leadership is caught in a civil war. The Parkland, Florida, activists have forced guns into the spotlight. Recent polls found Democratic voters put gun violence and policy at the top or near the top of issues they want to hear about in the debates.
Just like Bernie Sanders helped launch discussions about single-payer health care and free college in 2016, a push in 2020 could help get the party to where it needs to be on this issue if it really wants to address Americaâ€™s gun problem.
Democrats have played it safe on guns for decades
The gun problem in the United States is twofold.
First, the US makes it incredibly easy for people to get guns. Other developed nations at least require one or more background checks but usually much more rigorous hurdles. In the US, even a background check isnâ€™t an absolute requirement; the current federal law is riddled with loopholes and kneecapped by poor enforcement.
Second, America has far more guns than any other country. The number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was estimated for 2017 at 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, ranked second, with 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey.
Congress has tried to address the first problem. In 1993, it enacted federal background checks. A year later, it passed a 10-year assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.
In the quarter-century since, elected Democrats have continued advocating for expanded background checks and a renewed assault weapons ban. But a growing body of research has shown that these measures might not be enough â€” that the guns are the problem.
A breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeleyâ€™s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found the US doesnâ€™t actually have more crime than other developed nations, but instead has more lethal crime â€” and access to guns is one reason why. â€œA preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery,â€ they wrote, â€œmake similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.â€
Research compiled by the Harvard School of Public Healthâ€™s Injury Control Research Center backs this up: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths â€” not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings.
Stronger gun laws can help. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence â€” a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.
But the types of gun control laws matter. To that end, several studies from researchers at UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and Johns Hopkins have called into question whether universal background checks, compared to non-universal background checks, reduce gun deaths at all. Studies suggest the original assault weapons ban also had limited to no impact, in large part because the great majority of gun violence is carried out with handguns.
The problem is these approaches are just too narrow, failing to seriously address the core problem that the US simply has too many guns. Universal background checks only target a small number of people who have clear, bad histories, and an assault weapons ban targets a kind of weapon used in a small minority of shootings. To the extent that either approach works to reduce the number of gun owners and firearms, it would take generations to see results.
A better, more immediate goal, then, is to make it harder for literally anyone to buy a firearm and reduce the number of guns not just over time but right now. Thatâ€™s the only reliable way to reduce incidents of gun violence through gun control quickly.
But gun policy has been an outlier in Democratic politiciansâ€™ shift leftward. There has been some movement at the margins â€” demonstrated by some candidatesâ€™ support for licensing and even fewerâ€™s call for confiscating assault weapons, as well as centrist Democrats and those representing rural areas, including Bernie Sanders, shifting somewhat on this issue. But by and large, the party has remained in the same place it was in 25 years ago, focused on background checks and, to a lesser extent, an assault weapons ban.
There are some good reasons for that. Democratic perennials like universal background checks, targeting firearm prohibitions at people deemed dangerous, and even an assault weapons ban all poll fairly well, including among Republicans, based on Pew surveys.
Elected Democrats also a fear a political backlash if they push for more stringent measures. After the 1994 midterm elections, many Democrats blamed historic losses in the House and Senate on their approval of stricter gun laws.
Then thereâ€™s what experts call the â€œintensity gap.â€ In short, defenders of gun rights are, in general, more motivated than proponents of gun control. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, this helps explain why popular support for stricter gun laws doesnâ€™t lead to action in Congress: â€œThe question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their â€˜controlâ€™ position?â€ Probably not, he suggested, â€œbut for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.â€
All of this plays into the broader questions about whether certain gun policies could get through Congress or the Supreme Court. Until the public buys into these policies, chances are other institutions wonâ€™t either. So Democrats have by and large played it safe.
With Democratic voters now more liberal in general and paying more attention to gun violence as mass shootings regularly make the news and student activists march and protest for action, thereâ€™s less need to play it safe. Democrats, both elites and supporters, have a clear opportunity here to show that there are bolder, evidence-based policy ideas to seriously tackle the USâ€™s gun problem. They can start that push with 2020.
Democrats need to shift the conversation
Igor Volsky, the executive director of the advocacy group Guns Down America, pointed to the fight for marriage equality in his recent book, Guns Down: How to Defeat the NRA and Build a Safer Future With Fewer Guns, as one example of how this fight could go.
According to Volsky, the marriage equality movement didnâ€™t ever give up on incremental gains, but it was always focused on its ultimate goal. So it was okay when some Democrats, for example, accepted â€œcivil unionsâ€ over marriage as a step forward in the early 2000s, but the movement continued to push for marriage equality at the same time. By focusing on this goal and deploying different strategies fixated on the one acceptable outcome for the movement, it slowly built a shift in public opinion, even if the gains seemed small here and there.
By focusing on a goal of fewer guns, Volsky wrote, activists could push the country to the left on guns. That would involve accepting the incremental wins â€” including universal background checks and an assault weapons ban â€” but also staying focused on the goal of reducing the number of guns in the US overall.
And the 2020 campaign, he argued, is a good time to start that push.
â€œYou have progressives who are running for president talking about single-payer, talking about the Green New Deal, talking about breaking up large tech companies, talking about a super surcharge on multi-multimillionaires,â€ Volsky told me. â€œOn an issue that is so important to so many Americans â€” the issue of guns â€” itâ€™s unconscionable to me that the solutions weâ€™re hearing from the folks running for president are focused on incremental reforms that theyâ€™ve been selling for the last 20 years.â€
Another potential parallel comes through what Matt Yglesias has described for Vox as the â€œGreat Awokening.â€ Since 2014, he wrote, â€œwhite liberals have moved so far to the left on questions of race and racism that they are now, on these issues, to the left of even the typical black voter.â€ That happened in part because of the Black Lives Matter movement that took off after the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri, protests, but also because â€œDemocratic elites were beginning to signal to the rank and file that they should take systemic racism concerns more seriouslyâ€ â€” such as when President Barack Obama remarked that â€œif I had a son, heâ€™d look like Trayvon [Martin].â€
Similarly, American progressives are increasingly fed up with mass shooting after mass shooting â€” hence the rise of the March for Our Lives movement last year. If Democratic elites tap into that anger and signal that bolder gun policies are necessary, much of the public could follow along.
History shows that on gun policy, itâ€™s possible to move positions that once seemed radical into the mainstream. Consider just how much the National Rifle Association has changed the conversation about guns in just a few decades: After the NRA went through an internal revolt in the late 1970s, the group began to push against all restrictions on firearms â€” under the logic that giving even a little on this issue could eventually lead to a sweeping confiscation of everyoneâ€™s guns. The organization hammered that message to the public, politicians, legal scholars, and everyone else it could reach.
One clear effect the NRA had was changing the way some politicians and legal experts looked at the Second Amendment. For most of US history, the amendment was viewed by courts and legal experts as only protecting a collective right to own guns, insofar as able-bodied men needed the weapons to help defend their state and country through, for example, a militia. Then the NRA began pushing a different interpretation that the Second Amendment actually protected an individual right â€” even getting scholars to publish work in law journals making the case.
Carl T. Bogus, a researcher at the Roger Williams University School of Law, noted in a 2000 law review article that the number of law review articles endorsing an individual rights view was for most of US history dwarfed by the number backing a collective rights framework â€” until the 1990s, when the great majority (58 of 87 relevant articles) supported an individual rights interpretation.
Republican elites, too, got in on the action. In 1982, the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, led by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), issued a report, â€œThe Right to Keep and Bear Arms.â€ The report from the Republican-majority subcommittee argued, â€œWhat the Subcommittee on the Constitution uncovered was clear â€” and long lost â€” proof that the second amendment to our Constitution was intended as an individual right of the American citizen to keep and carry arms in a peaceful manner, for protection of himself, his family, and his freedoms.â€
The results can be seen in the Supreme Court. In 1939â€™s United States v. Miller, Justice James McReynolds ruled that Congress can ban sawed-off shotguns because that weapon has no â€œreasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.â€ In 2008â€™s District of Columbia v. Heller, Justice Antonin Scalia ruled, to the contrary, that â€œthe Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.â€
There was also an accompanying shift in public opinion. In 1959, when Gallup asked if the law should ban handguns except for the police and other authorized persons, 60 percent of Americans said yes. By 1980, that dropped to 38 percent. As of the latest survey, in 2018, it was 28 percent.
The NRA and Republicans helped shift public opinion and even the Supreme Court over decades. A similar political movement could reverse that.
Like the NRAâ€™s efforts, a new movement could require a generations-long project. That should only make the issue more urgent, though â€” because the longer America waits, the longer it will be before real measures are in to properly reduce gun violence.
What a bold gun policy would actually look like
Itâ€™s not that thereâ€™s a lack of ideas to confront gun violence. With the right goal â€” reducing the number of guns in the US â€” and a serious commitment to it, there are plenty of evidence-based policies, tried in cities, states, and other countries, that could work.
One way to start addressing the issue would be requiring a license to buy and own a gun. On its face, this might seem like an extension of the background check model, since the idea is still to filter between qualified and unqualified people.
But a licensing process can go way further: While a background check is more often than not quick and hassle-free, gun licensing in, for example, Massachusetts is a weeks- or months-long process that requires submitting a photograph and fingerprints, passing a training course, and going through one or more interviews, all involving law enforcement. That adds significant barriers for even a would-be gun owner who has no ill intent or bad history.
â€œThe end impact is you decrease gun ownership overall,â€ Cassandra Crifasi, a researcher (and gun owner) at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, previously told me, discussing Massachusettsâ€™s laws. â€œLots of folks think, â€˜Well, itâ€™s probably not worth going through all these hoops to buy firearms, so Iâ€™m not going to buy one.â€™ And then you have fewer firearms around, and less exposure.â€
Licensing works. Itâ€™s one reason, experts say, Massachusetts has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the US. A Johns Hopkins study on several gun control approaches, including universal background checks, found that licensing systems were the one policy associated with fewer firearm homicides. Other studies have linked licensing to significantly fewer gun homicides and suicides in Connecticut and Missouri.
This, however, could only be a start â€” the kind of thing that ensures fewer people get guns now and in the future. But in a country that already has so many firearms, something also needs to be done to take out a lot of guns more quickly.
That could require rethinking the Second Amendment, whether by appointing judges who interpret it differently in a reverse version of the NRAâ€™s campaign to portray gun ownership as an individual right. It might even mean beginning an effort to repeal it â€” a project that could admittedly take decades but has gotten less serious consideration and support than packing the Supreme Court or even abolishing the Senate.
Significant change could involve imposing bigger hurdles to owning a gun: requiring that people provide a stronger justification, besides self-defense or recreation, to get a license.
It could mean banning more types of guns â€” perhaps all semiautomatic weapons or all handguns â€” and coupling that with an Australian-style mandatory buyback program, which the research supports. If the key difference between America and other countries is how many more guns the US has, then something has to be done to quickly reduce the number of firearms here.
Here, an assault weapons ban is simply far too little. Shootings with rifles, including assault rifles, make up less than 3 percent of gun homicides in the US. More than 70 percent of gun homicides are instead carried out with handguns, which would be largely neglected by a plan to ban and confiscate only assault weapons. So perhaps bans on other guns, besides assault weapons, should be considered.
There has been some movement in the Democratic field. Booker was early in his call for a gun licensing requirement, and heâ€™s since been joined by candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. A few candidates have called for the confiscation of assault weapons as well.
But the field has shied away from significantly stronger proposals, and the candidates have strayed from saying that the ultimate goal should be to reduce the number of guns in the US. To the contrary, Eric Swalwell, while still a candidate for president, said on CNN in April, as he called for a mandatory buyback for assault weapons: â€œKeep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns. I want the most dangerous weapons â€” these weapons of war â€” out of the hands of the most dangerous people.â€
So the majority of the Democratic conversation remains focused on universal background checks and an assault weapons ban. Based on the research, this milquetoast approach just wonâ€™t be enough. If nothing else, the 2020 primary should force Democrats to explain why they should merely continue as they have for decades with little to show for it.

Voxâ€™s German Lopez explains why Democrats need a bold new plan for gun control:

"To secure a stable climate for future generations, humanity will need to permanently bury gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2). There is already too much in the atmosphere â€” 415 parts per million, when scientists say 350 ppm is the upper bound of safety â€” and we emit more and more each year.
Building a carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry of sufficient size would mean starting immediately, but at least for now, there is little financial incentive to do so. Companies canâ€™t make money burying carbon, so they mostly donâ€™t.
One way to scale up the carbon-capture side of the industry would be to boost demand for captured CO2, which can be used as an input or feedstock in various other industrial processes. Capturing CO2 (either from industrial waste streams or from the ambient air) and using it in industry is known as carbon capture and utilization (CCU).
The idea is that CCU can be used as an â€œon-rampâ€ for eventual CCS, pushing down the costs of carbon capture and laying down some of the foundational infrastructure, like pipelines, needed for eventual CCS at scale.
This is the second in what will be a four-part series of posts on CCU. The first is a brief introduction to the need for CCS and the various types of CCU that might help get it going. It will give you a lay of the land. In the third post, I will cover some of the more intriguing and promising uses of CO2, such as in concrete, fuels, and plastics.
In this post, however, I want to focus on what is currently the largest industrial use of CO2: enhanced oil recovery (EOR), whereby pressurized CO2 is injected into existing oil and gas reservoirs to squeeze more hydrocarbons out. Today, EOR is the only industrial use of CO2 that has reached appreciable scale.
As this graphic from market research firm IHS Markit shows, 88 percent of global CO2 use is â€œgaseous,â€ meaning direct use of CO2 to boost fossil fuel recovery (in the US, itâ€™s about 75 percent):
IHS Markit
And EOR holds another distinction: It is also the only current carbon sequestration industry of any scale. It uses a lot of CO2 and leaves a lot of it permanently buried. If thereâ€™s any on-ramp for CCS around, this is it.
EOR is an easy call for the oil and gas industry. More oil, more revenue; itâ€™s all upside. But for those of us interested in slowing and reversing the growth of global carbon emissions as quickly as possible, it is much more complicated. Vexing, even.
There is a strong argument for EOR as a way to reduce the carbon intensity of oil and sequester substantial amounts of carbon. But there is also a compelling case against it, namely that there should be less oil and gas production, not more.
Almost everyone Iâ€™ve spoken to about EOR feels at least a little conflicted about it. Is subsidizing oil production really the only way to get large-scale carbon sequestration started? Are we really going to let oil and gas companies influence the scale and speed of climate policy?
Letâ€™s try to suss this out. First, weâ€™ll review the case for, then the case against.
The climate case for EOR
New industry groups like the Energy Advance Center (BP, Chevron, Southern Company) and coalitions like the Carbon Capture Coalition (trade groups, oil and gas companies, and a few nonprofits) are springing up, making the argument that digging more oil and gas out of the ground can help fight climate change. It might seem counterintuitive, but in theory, at least, it is possible.
Letâ€™s review the basics of EOR. When oil companies dig wells, there are three phases of production. During primary production, the natural pressure built up within underground reservoirs pushes oil to the surface; about 10 percent of the oil in the reservoir is recovered this way. During secondary production, a fluid, usually water or gas, is pumped through the reservoir to flush loose more oil; that can recover anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of the oil.
Tertiary production is anything done after that, including injecting any fluid not originally found in the reservoir. The most common form of tertiary production is EOR, whereby high-pressure CO2, sometimes alternated with pulses of water, is injected into wells to bond with the oil and carry more of it to the surface. EOR can recover up to 60 percent of the oil in a reservoir.
NETL
(Technically, EOR can involve injecting a variety of substances, but for the purposes of this post, Iâ€™m going to use it to mean EOR using CO2.)
EOR has been around in the US since the early 1970s. The worldâ€™s most active EOR region is the Permian Basin, in western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. Of the 450,000 barrels per day produced by EOR in the US, 350,000 come from the Permian. Thousands of miles of pipeline and infrastructure have been built for the purpose.
A note here: EOR is different from hydraulic fracturing, or â€œfracking,â€ the much-better-known practice of pumping high-pressure fluids underground to release more oil and gas. In a nutshell, fracking forces open new fissures in the rock, while EOR â€œscrubsâ€ existing channels.
(For the best technical rundown of EOR and its CO2 mitigating potential, see this new paper in Frontiers in Climate, by Vanessa NÃºÃ±ez-LÃ³pez and Emily Moskal of the Jackson School of Geosciences and the University of Texas at Austin respectively, henceforth â€œthe Frontiers paper.â€ For a shorter and more accessible treatment, see this brief by researcher Deepika Nagabhushan for the Clean Air Task Force.)
Most of the CO2 used in EOR stays underground
When CO2 is injected underground for EOR, most of it, around 90 to 95 percent, stays there, trapped in the geologic formation where the oil was once trapped. If the CO2 comes from the right source and enough is buried, it could amount to substantial carbon sequestration. But those are important caveats.
First, less than 15 percent of the CO2 used in todayâ€™s US EOR operations (as of 2010) is pulled from â€œanthropogenicâ€ sources like natural gas processing and hydrocarbon conversions. Over 85 percent comes from â€œterrestrialâ€ sources, a few big natural CO2 reservoirs under the Earthâ€™s surface. It was already sequestered; it has to be dug up. The best EOR can hope to do is re-bury it, a decidedly carbon-intensive practice over the full lifecycle.
(No appreciable amount of EOR CO2 yet comes from direct air capture, though thereâ€™s a big DAC demonstration plant running in the Permian.)
Second, absent government policy, EOR operators view CO2 entirely as a cost. They want to minimize how much they buy, how much they use, and how much remains sequestered.
EOR advocates in the climate community say that both these conditions can be changed through smart regulations and incentives. They say EOR companies can be guided by policy to a) prefer captured CO2 over terrestrial CO2, and b) use and bury as much CO2 as possible.
In an ideal world, all EOR operations would draw exclusively on anthropogenic CO2, and they would all sequester the maximum amount possible. That might make them carbon negative on a lifecycle basis. Even short of that, they could lower the lifecycle emissions of the oil and gas produced.
As long as oil and gas are being used, advocates say, itâ€™s better to have lower-carbon versions. In other words, counter-intuitively, digging up more oil and gas could help make progress on climate change. This vision has a number of things to recommend it.
CATF
EOR is an attractive on-ramp for CCS
First, the big problem with CCS is that, in the absence of a fairly stiff price on carbon, thereâ€™s no incentive to do it, which means itâ€™s hard to get private capital to invest in it. EOR is the only form of large-scale, permanent carbon sequestration that currently makes a profit. Under the right policy regime, the profit-making motive could be harnessed in service of burying carbon. In the process, EOR could help scale up CCS and drive costs down.
Second, while most of the saline aquifers (porous, brine-filled rocks deep underground) that are being discussed for large-scale CCS have not yet been explored in any detail, the reservoirs from which EOR draws are much better understood. There are more historical records, they have been subject to more testing and monitoring, and their ability to securely store their contents over long periods of time has been demonstrated by the fact that they trapped hydrocarbons for millions of years. They are promising locations with which to get started on CCS in the near term.
Third, oil companies have the equipment, experience, and capital to manage a huge industry like CCS. They know exactly the price point at which burying CO2 would become more profitable than digging up oil and will switch from the one to the other when that price point is reached. They already have much of the infrastructure in place. Itâ€™s just up to policymakers to help make capture CO2 cheap.
Ultimately, the ability to effectively use EOR to reduce carbon depends on a standardized method of measuring the full lifecycle emissions of the EOR process. Such a standard is now sorely lacking. There are basic disagreements over how and what to measure. Thereâ€™s no way to fairly credit EORâ€™s carbon reductions until they can be quantified.
Whether EOR actually is, or can be, carbon-negative is the subject of much dispute
As the Frontiers paper shows, many different lifecycle analyses (LCAs) have been done on EOR, but they tend to draw the boundaries of the analysis in different places, which makes them difficult to compare. Some conclude EOR operations are a net CO2 contributor; some that they are net carbon negative. It is confusing.
Frontiers in Climate
One of the authors of the Frontiers paper, NuÃ±ez-LÃ³pez, has done a dynamic LCA on EOR projects, which measures the CO2 released over time as oil production diminishes. It found that EOR projects are net carbon-negative early on â€” anywhere from six to 18 years â€” and then go carbon positive as oil production declines.
Regulators could use that information to encourage maximizing mitigation potential; Operator decisions can make a big difference in how much CO2 is ultimately captured. Industry analysts think that, with advanced EOR techniques and boosted storage, the amount of CO2 injected per barrel of oil could rise from 0.40 to 0.60 tons.
Here, the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) draws on an International Energy Agency (IEA) lifecycle analysis showing that, taking into account the effect of additional oil supply on the global market, a barrel of EOR oil represents 37 percent less CO2 than conventional oil. (The CO2 in the modeling is captured at coal and natural gas plants.)
CATF
Keep in mind, though, that this kind of analysis depends on quantifying exactly how much new EOR oil will displace other, dirtier forms of oil â€” versus simply adding to the amount of oil consumed. Those kinds of predictions are notoriously dodgy; no one truly knows how much boosted oil supply from EOR might simply increase the worldâ€™s oil addiction.
Until LCA becomes more standardized and reliable, policy crediting EOR for CO2 reductions involves a fair amount of hope and faith.
In the US, the main policy support for EOR is the 45Q tax credit
As the Frontiers paper shows, the legal and regulatory regime governing EOR is kind of a mess, mostly adapted from an oil and gas regulatory regime designed to drive more domestic production.
In the US, the primary policy support for CCS is the 45Q federal tax credit, which was expanded and reformed in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. (Tax incentives for the oil and gas industry are what pass for bipartisan climate policy in the US Congress.)
45Q now offers:
$35/ton for CO2 sequestered by EOR
$35/ton for other beneficial uses of CO2 (e.g., synthetic fuels or plastics â€” my next article will be on this)
$50/ton for CO2 sequestered outside of EOR.
(All these credits phase in over a 10-year period from 2017 to 2026.)
As this modeling from CATF shows, 45Q â€œleads to significant deployment of CCS, capturing and storing approximately 49 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually in 2030,â€ without displacing any renewable energy. That would get the US about two-thirds of the way to the reductions needed by 2030 in the electricity sector.
Even the amount of CCS expected to be induced by 45Q is nowhere close to what IEA says will be required in a 2-degree scenario. However, EOR advocates say, itâ€™s a start.
EOR is potentially big enough in scale to absorb most of the carbon captured at industrial facilities for the next several decades. And with the political and policy landscape so uncertain, the Frontiers paper concludes, â€œCO2-EOR is the main conduit through which companies planning to or already employing CCS find value in the face of political uncertainty.â€
That, in brief, is the climate case for EOR.
The climate case against EOR
The case against EOR is more piecemeal. Many environmental groups oppose it because of its potential effects on groundwater. Many environmental justice groups oppose it because they believe, with good reason, that the polluting facilities kept alive by carbon capture will be located in their communities.
But the core of the climate case against EOR is simple: Climate change is an emergency. We need to bury lots of carbon, but it is crazy to let the oil and gas industry set the pace and the terms. EOR under certain rarified circumstances may be carbon negative, but you know whatâ€™s always carbon negative? Burying CO2 without digging up a bunch of oil to burn.
Sooner or later, weâ€™re going to have more carbon to bury than EOR can handle anyway. Weâ€™re going to have to figure out how to bury it in saline aquifers. From a climate perspective, it makes sense to figure that out, and start doing it, as soon as possible.
Rather than slowly luring private capital into the enterprise by subsidizing oil and gas production â€” putting one foot on the accelerator and one on the brake â€” we should just cough up the public money necessary to do CCS at scale, just like we did with public sewer systems to dispose of a different kind of waste.
After all, empowering oil and gas companies with new sources of oil and revenue is not without cost, in political economy terms.

Fossil fuel money crushed clean energy ballot initiatives across the country
Oil and gas companies are, after all, bad actors. For decades upon decades, theyâ€™ve been lying about climate change, fighting furiously against any regulation that would force them to internalize the costs of their pollution, and lobbying against clean energy policies at the federal and state level, especially through their trade associations and dark money groups. They are still doing all of those things today.
Yes, they sell a product we need, for which there is demand. But thatâ€™s just the point: They are corporations driven by the profit motive to sell as much of their product as possible. Humanityâ€™s long-term interests dictate using as little of their product as possible. The struggle against climate change is, in part, going to be a struggle against oil and gas companies. Sure, in theory, over time, they could evolve into pure carbon sequestration companies or renewable energy companies or pipeline services companies. But in this reality, now, they are multi-billion-dollar hydrocarbon companies.
Anyone who ignores that basic political economy, who believes oil and gas companies will be good-faith partners in a climate-emergency effort, is indulging in a kind of willful naivete that is entirely too common in the carbon wonk community.
EOR represents an enormous new source of production and revenue for oil companies
Today, EOR using CO2 is only responsible for about 5 percent of US crude oil production, but it is key to the industryâ€™s plans for expansion (note: expansion, not phase out).
There is an enormous pot of gold at the end of the EOR rainbow. Market consultants Advanced Resources International estimates the total amount of additional oil accessible by EOR in the US is 284 billion barrels. (As of 2018, the US consumes about 7.5 billion barrels a year.) It says that 80 billion barrels of that are recoverable with â€œnext generation EORâ€ technologies already in use.
ARI
One of the primary US EOR companies, Denbury Resources has told investors that CO2-EOR can unlock between 10 and 23 billion barrels of oil in Texas alone.
Newer research on â€œresidual oil zonesâ€ has shown enough promise that researchers claim it could unlock 800 billion, even a trillion new barrels to recovery, just in the Permian Basin.
And thatâ€™s just in conventional oil wells. Though it doesnâ€™t come up much in EOR discussions, the â€œnext frontierâ€ for the oil industry is to use CO2 to boost unconventional shale oil and gas. (The Department of Energyâ€™s $40 million investment in EOR included one unconventional oil project in the Bakken.)
â€œIf the industry can perfect CO2 injection into shale formations and tight oil,â€ John NoÃ«l, a researcher at Greenpeace, told me, â€œit could unlock an almost endless amount of oil under the right conditions.â€
That is an enormous incentive to pursue EOR. But hereâ€™s the thing: The single biggest expense in EOR operations is CO2. At times in recent history, EORâ€™s expansion was constrained by the supply of CO2. Thereâ€™s reason to believe that CO2 from natural reservoirs canâ€™t possibly keep up with EOR demand in coming years.
The oil and gas industry badly needs more and cheaper CO2 in order to expand EOR operations.
Now, it has realized that it can reframe its use of CO2 in EOR as an effort to fight climate change. Itâ€™s is a win-win for oil and gas companies: They get to pose as climate champions, harvesting the good PR, while taxpayers subsidize a key industrial input thatâ€™s driving their expansion. Meanwhile, they are forming groups like Advance Energy Center to lobby for the weakest possible rules and oversight.
Most EOR operations are dirty and oil and gas groups are lobbying against regulation
Letâ€™s remember that today, the vast majority of EOR operations are not using anthropogenic CO2. They are using terrestrial CO2. That kind of EOR is, from a climate perspective, garbage â€” if anything, worse than conventional oil production.
And oil and gas companies are already using their influence to game the rules that exist. Currently, the IRS is updating its guidance on how to implement 45Q requirements. Oil and gas companies, under cover of Energy Advance Center, submitted comments to the IRS arguing that the agency should get rid of the strict verification rules for EOR sequestration (Subpart RR under the EPAâ€™s GHG Reporting Rule, for fans) that were implemented with the expanded 45Q credits. That would mean EOR projects could claim credits based on the amount of CO2 received on site, with no obligation to demonstrate or verify actual storage.
On a political level, this is what it means to let oil and gas companies into the climate effort. â€œItâ€™s in their DNA to cut corners, deregulate, gaslight, and streamline,â€ NoÃ«l told me. â€œI am confident there are a dozen other areas where the industry is taking advantage of access to regulators and their well resourced expertise in order normalize O&G development in ways the progressive community doesnâ€™t even see yet.â€

The climate case for EOR is ultimately an argument that a path forward amenable to oil and gas companies is the only path possible. Give them regulatory certainty and enough subsidies, and they will eventually build the CCS needed while unlocking billions of barrels of oil along the way.
The climate case against EOR would urge us to think bigger.
Thinking bigger about EOR and CCS
If climate change is an emergency, policymakers ought to treat it that way. It cannot be enough to slowly induce oil and gas companies to shift to more carbon-friendly practices, taking care not to unduly startle them. They must be jolted.
At the very least, 45Q should be strengthened, the monitoring and verification standards protected, and the subsidy for geologic storage increased. But here are a few policy ideas, listed in order of increasing ambition, that might get the decarbonization job done faster.
Rather than simply subsidizing the EOR operations that choose to switch to captured CO2, all EOR operations could be required to do so. And they could be required to maximize (and verify) permanent geologic sequestration. Those requirements could be accompanied, in the beginning, by a subsidy, to avoid any alarming jumps in oil or gasoline prices, but over time, subsidies could fade out and they could simply become regulatory requirements. The social license of EOR operations should be contingent on their burying captured carbon, and they should shoulder those costs.
A national low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS), like the one in California, could be put in place and steadily ratcheted down, requiring all oil and gas companies, not just those doing EOR, to offset more and more of the carbon content of their products, until eventually they were burying (or funding the burial of) an amount of carbon equal to the amount their fuels produced. (The LCFS would also apply to imported oil.) This would also amount to a fundamental change in the social license of oil and gas operations. You want to dig up oil and gas; you have to pay to bury carbon.
Oil and gas companies could be nationalized and set, by policy, on a path that would steadily phase out production of hydrocarbons and steadily scale up carbon sequestration. Eventually, they would become large, publicly owned sequestration companies. Thereâ€™s simply no reason to have private, profit-making entities standing as middlemen between the public and the solution to an existential crisis, slowing things down and skimming off the rewards.
I donâ€™t know that I necessarily endorse any of these ideas unreservedly â€” Iâ€™d need to do a lot more thinking and talking to people to wrap my head around them â€” but I list them to make a point: The EOR conversation among wonks and policymakers is woefully narrow. It is built around the presumption that oil and gas companies must be kept happy and that political disturbance must be minimized.
Treating climate change as an emergency means embracing the fact that political disturbance is inevitable and so is a struggle with the political power of the oil and gas industry. It may be that EOR can play a constructive role in a comprehensive decarbonization plan, helping to reduce the carbon content of the oil we canâ€™t avoid using. But its use and limitations should be shaped by the public interest, not by the interests of oil and gas investors."
"Elizabeth Warren wants to tax the corporate lobbying she says is breaking the American political system.
Warren, whose presidential campaign has been incrementally releasing a package of anti-corruption proposals, has unveiled a plan to tax corporations and trade organizations that spend a lot of money lobbying Congress and federal agencies.
The proposal would tax groups and companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying at a 35 percent rate, increasing the rate for bigger lobbying budgets. Corporations and trade groups that spend more than $1 million per year on lobbying would get hit with a 60 percent tax rate, and those spending more than $5 million would see a 75 percent tax rate.
These brackets would hit the pocketbooks of big pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, the real estate industry, fossil fuel companies, Wall Street firms, and electric utilities the hardest. They do not apply to charitable or social welfare organizations that also lobby the government, such as 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 nonprofit groups, but do apply to trade and professional associations, 501(c)6 groups.
For example, the US Chamber of Commerce, which successfully advocated for lower corporate tax rates, spent more than $1 billion on lobbying between 2009 and 2018. Under this plan, it would have had to pay roughly $770.8 million in taxes during that time period. Likewise, private insurance company Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which spent about $233.5 million in government lobbying between 2009 and 2018, would have paid nearly $163.4 million in taxes.
This proposal is in line with many ideas that have been floated in good-government circles â€” ideas like creating tax incentives for companies that donâ€™t spend money on lobbying or creating a separate tax bracket all together for companies that do, according to Lisa Gilbert, with progressive consumer protection think tank Public Citizen.
â€œTaxing corporate special interest lobbying as a means to push back on the influence machine is both innovative and important,â€ Gilbert said.
With organizations like PhRMA â€” which represents the pharmaceutical industry and spent more than $217 million in lobbying over the last decade â€” the tax would hit the trade group, not the member companies. This could allow the trade group to share the cost of the tax with member groups, mitigating budgetary pain.
But the Warren campaign doesnâ€™t see that as a problem. The point is twofold: Either the tax is enough to discourage massive corporate lobbying efforts, or it leads to some federal revenue. They also recognize the tax could bring in less revenue over time if the tax effectively disincentives high-dollar lobbying efforts.
The proposal estimates the tax would have raised $10 billion in revenue over the last 10 years, based on the last decade of lobbying expenditures. Thatâ€™s a notably smaller haul than some of her other tax proposals (her wealth tax raises $2.75 trillion). Her team says the money from the lobbyist tax would go toward more anti-corruption measures â€” like boosting funding for in-house policy resources â€” to keep lawmakers and federal agencies independent from influence.
Warren has identified lobbying as core to Washingtonâ€™s inability to take meaningful action on everything from gun control, the environment, and health care. On the campaign trail, she lists passing a sweeping anti-corruption package as one of her first priorities if she is elected president.
Warren has put an anti-lobbying message at the center of her presidential campaign
Warrenâ€™s presidential campaign has been defined by its relentless focus on rooting out corruption in Washington DC.
The senator from Massachusetts first released a wide-ranging anti-corruption bill back in August 2018, well before she announced her campaign for president. And sheâ€™s been adding to it ever since. Warren has been clear she thinks thereâ€™s no way meaningful legislation can be passed without dealing with federal and congressional lobbyists first.
â€œThe rich and the powerful have been calling the shots in Washington forever and ever and ever it feels like,â€ Warren told Voxâ€™s Ezra Klein in June. â€œTheyâ€™re not going to just say, â€˜Oh, well, okay. Now you need a wealth tax. Now you want to make these other investments.â€™ ... I think going straight up the middle on the corruption plan is the first one. Knock them back, and while theyâ€™re all scrambling, then start passing the rest of it.â€
While anti-corruption policies are overwhelmingly popular with the American public, regardless of political affiliation, it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress, where Republicans have been reluctant to take up legislation around transparency and lobbying.
Warrenâ€™s larger anti-corruption plan is far-reaching; it would already instate a lifetime lobbying ban for presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, federal judges, and Cabinet secretaries, and multi-year lobbying bans for federal employees (both congressional staffers and employees of federal agencies), among other things.
Last week, Warren also proposed a plan to revitalize one current and one former agency that Congress relied on for policy information and the cost of bills. Warrenâ€™s plan would increase federal funding for the current Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes how a bill will impact the federal budget. It would also bring back the now-defunct Office of Technology Assessment, which gave lawmakers and their staff objective analysis and research on scientific and technology policy until former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich shuttered the agency in 1995.
Warren argues the closure of OTA has created a vacuum now occupied by corporate lobbyists, oftentimes peddling research funded by companies that have a distinct agenda. In addition to bringing it back, she also wants to create a new Office of the Public Advocate, which would act as a voice for the public during the federal rulemaking process.
This new tax is a funding stream for Warrenâ€™s larger plan to strengthen these congressional support industries. It also sends a signal to corporations that sheâ€™s serious about curbing their influence."
"News reports this week have clarified that Attorney General William Barrâ€™s promised investigation into the origins of the FBI investigation of links between Russia and the Trump campaign is very real, and has involved high-level talks and meetings with the governments of four countries â€” Ukraine, Italy, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
Thatâ€™s a motley assortment of nations whose links and relevance may not be obvious to someone who gets their news from mainstream sources.
The four countries link together as part of a counternarrative popular on the right that holds that the real scandal of the Trump-Russia affair is not anything Trump (or the Russians) did but a â€œdeep stateâ€ plot by intelligence agencies to swing the election against Hillary Clinton.
This theory makes no sense on its face â€” the investigation into Trump was kept secret from the public at the time it could have swayed the election, while the FBI leaked repeatedly in ways that were damaging to Hillary Clinton â€” but itâ€™s grown increasingly influential in conservative politics over the years and is now apparently driving American foreign policy. As is often the case with this kind of conspiracy theory, the counternarrative is not exactly coherent, but the geography of Barrâ€™s investigations does help explain its scope and rough contours.
Italy and the search for Joseph Mifsud
Affording to the official narrative of events, the FBIâ€™s Trump-Russia inquiry began when an intoxicated George Papadopoulos told Australiaâ€™s ambassador to the UK that heâ€™d been approached by a mysterious professor who claimed to be acting on behalf of the Russian government and would be able to provide the Trump campaign with â€œdirtâ€ on Hillary Clinton.
That professor turns out to be Joseph Mifsud.
The Mueller report describes Mifsud as â€œa London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to Moscow in April 2016â€ and recounts that â€œimmediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told Papadopoulos that the Russian government had â€˜dirtâ€™ on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.â€
The report further states that Papadopoulosâ€™s various false statements about these meetings made it difficult for the FBI to adequately interrogate Mifsud, thus letting him get away with lying to them about various matters, and leading them to fail to apprehend a Russian intelligence asset when they had the chance:
Papadopoulosâ€™s false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBIâ€™s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, those statements hindered investigatorsâ€™ ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby of a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. See Govâ€™t Sent. Mem. at 6, United States v. George Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44. During that interview, Mifsud admitted to knowing Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and Timofeev. But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of emails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed cybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their conversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meeting at which Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even though emails, text messages, and other information show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasionsâ€”April 12 and April 26, 2016. In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up message that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that, as reflected in the language of that email chain (â€œBaby, thank you!â€), Mifsud may have been involved in a personal relationship with Polonskaya at the time. The false information and omissions in Papadopoulosâ€™s January 2017 interview undermined investigatorsâ€™ ability to challenge Mifsud when he made these inaccurate statements.
Papadopoulosâ€™s story about all this is different.
In his telling, rather than being a liar whose dishonesty impeded a legitimate counterintelligence investigation, heâ€™s a patsy. Mifsud was never a Russian agent at all, but rather an Italian asset sent to entrap Papadopoulos as a favor to Obama-era CIA Director John Brennan. Papadopoulos made this most explicit when the government of Italy shook up its intelligence services. He described it at the time as a â€œflip,â€ and suggested the Russia-friendly right-wing populist government of Italy would shortly reveal the truth.
In the Italian press, this shake-up was debated in terms of fairly conventional partisan politics. The Italian intelligence services were rocked by a series of scandals in the mid-aughts, which led to a major reorganization led by then-Prime Minister Romano Prodiâ€™s center-left government. The conventional Italian interpretation of the shakeup this spring was either that the new right-wing government was backsliding on important reforms or else correcting the errors of the Prodi era.
But on the transatlantic conservative web, this was a key development that was supposedly about to lift the veil on the scandal known as â€œspygateâ€ on English-language sites and â€œItalygateâ€ on Italian-language ones.
Since all this was months ago back in May and the grand reveal never happened, lesser minds might conclude that the scandal is fake. But Barr, operating on the theory that maybe the Italian government just forgot to follow through or something, traveled to Italy this fall to sniff around. Mifsud himself, after all, has been missing from public view for months but did perhaps surface briefly in Rome.
Alexander Downer down under
Alexander Downer became executive director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce way back in 1983, a member of parliament for the Australian Liberal Party (which is the countryâ€™s main conservative party) in 1984, served briefly as leader of the Liberal Party in opposition in the mid-1990s, became foreign minister in John Howardâ€™s long-tenured right-wing coalition government from 1996-2007, left politics after Howardâ€™s electoral defeat, but returned to government as high commissioner to the United Kingdom under Tony Abbottâ€™s government in 2014. He is, in other words, a distinguished albeit somewhat-past-his-prime member of the right side of the Australian political establishment.
He met Papadapoulos in London, heard about the meetings with Mifsud, and with the approval of the Australian government, passed the tip on to the FBI.
Or if you believe Papadopoulos, he is part of the vast transcontinental left-wing conspiracy to bring him down. Papadopoulos vowed back in July that Downer would be â€œnextâ€ to be exposed after Mifsud.
Mifsud, of course, had not yet been exposed (perhaps because thereâ€™s nothing to expose) but that did not stop Papadopoulos from confidently reiterating on Monday that Barrâ€™s talks with the Australian government would shortly reveal that Downer is a â€œClinton errand boy who is about to get exposed on the world stage.â€
Meanwhile, back in Australia the subject of debate is about whether current Prime Minister Scott Morrison, another Liberal, struck an inappropriate Ukraine-style deal with Trump in order to advance the conspiracy. Opposition Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese has argued that â€œthe prime minister needs to explain to the Australian people exactly what happened here,â€ while Bill Shorten, a former Labor leader and cabinet minister, is asking questions about Morrisonâ€™s recent trip to Washington suggesting â€œperhaps the special reception was in exchange for special services done.â€
Not only does it make very little sense to suggest that a veteran conservative politician from Australia would be acting as Clintonâ€™s catspaw in this venture, itâ€™s not even clear what role Downer would have played in the posited conspiracy. After all, if Mifsud was working to entrap Papadopoulos on behalf of John Brennan the whole time, then Mifsud himself could have just reported the successful sting back to the FBI without the need for an Australian cut-out.
Although of course perhaps that simply goes to show how clever the plan is.
Stefan Halper in the UK
Stefan Halper is an old-school American right-winger who worked for Alexander Haig, Donald Rumsfeld, and Dick Cheney during the Nixon and Ford administrations before working on George H.W. Bushâ€™s 1980 primary campaign and then eventually for the Reagan-Bush campaign effort. He served in a senior role in the Reagan State Department and there are some suggestions that via his role as a founder of the Palmer National Bank he played a role in the Iran-Contra scandal.
Halper drifted out of government and in 2001 became director of American Studies at the University of Cambridge in England. While there, he continued to be involved with American think tanks and as a foreign policy pundit.
In 2007, he coauthored The Silence of the Rational Center: Why American Foreign Policy is Failing with Jonathan Clarke. The book is essentially a critique of Bush-era â€œneoconservativeâ€ grandiosity written from the perspective of realpolitik and conservative nationalism. Broadly speaking, the same kind of criticisms that Trump leveled against Bush-era foreign policy and that have been the subject of some tensions between him and his own national security team. White House trade director recommended Halper for an ambassadorship early in the Trump administration.
Seemingly as part of the FBIâ€™s investigation into Papadopoulosâ€™s claims to be working with the Russian government, Halper reached out to Papadopoulos in England and also to Carter Page who had made some similar claims. Trump and his allies in the media turned this around into the idea that the FBI had just gone and embedded a spy in Trumpâ€™s campaign â€” the original meaning of â€œspygateâ€ before the conspiracy metastasized.
Former House Oversight Chair Trey Gowdy, former Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Intelligence Chair Richard Burr have all confirmed that there was nothing improper about the FBIâ€™s handling of the situation, seeing the outreach through Halper as a light-touch means of looking into curious claims by Trump staffers without spying on the campaign. But former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes has been insistent that these events constituted malfeasance, and Papadopoulos linked them up with his larger Mifsud/Downer conspiracy theory.
This is what he cites as evidence: A conservative foreign policy expert living in Britain once attended some kind of event that Australiaâ€™s conservative foreign minister also was at.
One possible explanation is that members of the right-of-center Anglophone foreign policy community have personal and professionals links to one another due to their shared interests. The other is that the two men were covertly part of a vast left-wing conspiracy to bring down the Trump administration â€” a conspiracy that for some reason forgot to reveal any of its evidence to the public before Election Day.
Compared to this convoluted web of nonsense, the Ukrainian leg of the expedition is almost remarkably clear-cut.
The three Ukrainian angles
While the â€œspygateâ€ conspiracy theory ropes in several different countries in a confusing way, Ukraine is just one country that is at the center of numerous Trump efforts.
First, as is now well-understood he wants the Ukrainian government to say that Joe Biden pressured an earlier Ukrainian president to fire the countryâ€™s chief prosecutor in order to protect his son Hunterâ€™s financial interests. This is not true. Bidenâ€™s effort to get the prosecutor fired were broadly supported by European governments, no Republicans disagreed with the push at the time, and thereâ€™s no reason to believe Hunterâ€™s financial interests were advanced by this move in any way.
Second, Trump appears to believe that an American company called Crowdstrike is actually Ukrainian (one of its founders was born in Russia but moved to Tennessee when he was 14) and in scattered tweets and statements hangs two different conspiracy theories on this â€œfactâ€:
One is the idea that Crowdstrike, acting on behalf of the Ukrainian government, misattributed the hack of the DNC email servers to the Russian government.
The other is the idea that Hillary Clinton deleted damning emails off her personal server but that these emails may be recoverable in Ukraine somewhere.
In addition to reflecting confusion about Crowdstrikeâ€™s relationship to Ukraine, this discourse appears to involve mixing up the DNC email server (which the Russian government hacked) and the Clinton email server (which they did not). Trump of course responded to the original DNC server hack with his infamous â€œRussia, if youâ€™re listeningâ€ comment in which he publicly asked Russian hackers to recover and release the missing Clinton emails.
The fact that Trump publicly invited Russian computer criminals to assist his campaign might partially explain why it was widely believed that Trump was working in cahoots with Russian computer criminals (though of course Trump now believes it was a plot to frame him involving Italian intelligence and the former prime minister of Australia).
Itâ€™s also worth emphasizing that Clinton says the reason she deleted those emails is they were personal in nature rather than relating to her work in the State Department. If Clinton did send and receive work-related emails that she then deleted, then the people to whom she sent the emails (or those who sent the emails to her) would have their own copies of the emails on State Department servers. The FBI investigated Clintonâ€™s emails extensively and did not find any examples of such wrongdoing.
According to Trumpâ€™s former Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert, the president has been repeatedly advised that this conspiracy theory about Crowdstrike is wrong but Trump keeps pressing ahead with it.
Trump has found his Roy Cohn
To be clear, during the 2016 campaign:
The FBI kept its open counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaignâ€™s links with Russia secret and hidden from the public.
The FBI repeatedly violated Justice Department guidelines to castigate Clintonâ€™s email related behavior, leaked about the investigation, and publicly reopened the investigation at an inopportune time without even checking if any actual new evidence has unearthed (there was no new evidence).
Under the circumstances, it is extremely difficult to see how anything that happened could possibly have been part of an FBI plot to take Trump down.
What happened is that after Trump won the election, this investigation became a problem for him. It led to the conviction of his campaign manager on a number of serious financial crimes, and Trump fired the FBI director in a failed effort to block an inquiry into the activities of his national security adviser who likewise turned out to be guilty of a number of serious crimes.
At that time it became convenient for Trump to start professing to believe that he had been the victim of an FBI frame-up. And since Papadopoulos also got caught breaking the law, it became convenient for him to start positioning himself as the victim of a broad international conspiracy.
From Watergate through to Jeff Sessionsâ€™s term as attorney general, there was a consensus in the United States that Justice Department work should be depoliticized rather than conducted as an extension of politics out of the West Wing of the White House. Trump never liked this arrangement, famously asking, â€œWhereâ€™s my Roy Cohn?â€ and castigating Sessions for refusing to act like Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer in his capacity as attorney general.
Barrâ€™s discussions about this with foreign heads of state and cabinet ministers is somewhere between silly and a waste of time. But his eagerness to personally involve himself in a politically sensitive investigation in this way represents a bigger breach of norms and principles that â€” especially in combination with things like Trumpâ€™s vocal demands to have his critics in congress arrested â€” is rather more alarming."
"A group of 14 researchers just set off a firestorm with a new series of studies that upends years of nutrition advice about meat. Their five systematic reviews, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggest thereâ€™s no health reason to eat less red meat â€” not even the bacon and salami weâ€™ve been told for years to cut back on.
Led by Dalhousie University epidemiologist Bradley Johnston, the authors, who hail from seven different countries, focused on the impact of red meat consumption on cancer, cardiovascular disease, and mortality, among other effects, as well as peopleâ€™s values and preferences regarding red meat.
Based on these studies, their conclusions â€” summarized in a new Annals clinical guideline â€” challenge the guidelines from just about every major national and international health group. Just four years ago, the World Health Organizationâ€™s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) announced that people should cut back on processed meats if they wanted to avoid certain types of cancer. The American Heart Association and the US governmentâ€™s dietary guidelines panel have also long suggested curbing our meat habit for better health.
But the authors of the new studies argue that people can â€œcontinue their current consumption of both unprocessed red meat and processed meat,â€ meaning whatever amount theyâ€™re currently eating. Thatâ€™s because the health impact of cutting back is either nonexistent or small, and the evidence of any harms is so weak, that itâ€™d be misleading to suggest people should avoid meat for health reasons.
Importantly, the studies did not investigate non-health reasons for eschewing beef and bacon â€” including animal welfare and meat productionâ€™s harmful impact on the environment â€” and the science backing the environmental case remains stronger than ever.

The way we eat could doom us as a species. Hereâ€™s a new diet designed to save us.
But whatâ€™s really interesting about this new series is the argument that previously published guidelines have been, well, bad science.
â€œThese papers provide a nice counterbalance to the current norm in nutritional epidemiology where scientists with strong advocacy tend to overstate their findings and ask for major public health overhauls even though the evidence is weak,â€ said Stanford meta-researcher John Ioannidis, a longtime critic of nutrition science who was not involved in the research.
So it comes as no surprise that already, the Annals series has prompted a fierce blowback from various groups whoâ€™ve long argued that red and processed meat consumption should be curbed. The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and a slew of other researchers objected to the series. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine â€” a group thatâ€™s long endorsed a plant-based diet â€” filed a petition with the Federal Trade Commission in response to the studies, asking the agency to â€œcorrect false statementsâ€ contained in the report, which they deemed a â€œmajor disservice to public health.â€
So how did the authors of the new studies come to a wildly different conclusion? Itâ€™s less a story about whether or not one should eat meat and more about the challenges of nutrition science and how eating recommendations should be made.
Why the study authors determined eating red meat is fine for health
In the past, many of the groups that have set guidelines for whether or not humans should cut back on meat considered a very broad range of research, from animal evidence to case-control studies, a relatively weak type of observational research. (Hereâ€™s more on different types of study designs.) As you may have guessed, there are all kinds of problems with these kinds of study designs.
Models based on animal studies donâ€™t always bear out in humans. Case-control studies are not the most reliable, either: Researchers start with an endpoint (for example, people who already have cancer). For each person with a disease (a case), they find a match (a control) â€” or someone who doesnâ€™t have the disease. They then look backward in time and try to determine if any patterns of exposure (in this case, eating meat) differed in those with cancer compared to those who donâ€™t have cancer.
But since meat eaters differ so fundamentally from those who donâ€™t eat meat, the reasons the two groups have varying health outcomes could have nothing to do with meat. Researchers try to control for these â€œconfounding factors,â€ but they canâ€™t capture all of them.
Some past reports on meat eating have also factored in the environmental and social effects of gobbling up steaks and bacon.
The five Annals papers did something different: They looked only at the health effects of processed and unprocessed red meat. Processed red meats â€” everything from hotdogs and bacon to lunch meats â€” are transformed by salting, curing, or fermentation. Unprocessed meats include beef, veal, pork, lamb, and venison. The papers were also systematic reviews and meta analyses, or syntheses of the research evidence that bring together a bunch of studies with the goal of coming to more fully supported conclusions. And the researchers used a very strict definition of what constituted reliable evidence for inclusion in their reviews.
GRADE, a tool researchers used to come up with their guidelines, explained
More specifically, they relied on a trusted research-rating system called GRADE, or the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, to decide which studies to include in their papers. GRADE was developed for creating summaries of research evidence to help guide health decision-making. Itâ€™s currently the most widely used tool for evaluating the quality of science, with more than 110 organizations endorsing the method.
The idea behind GRADE is to push reviewers to base their conclusions on only the most certain evidence available. And, according to the toolâ€™s criteria, in the case of meat consumption and health, that was large cohort studies and randomized control trials. So the researchers simply threw everything else out, including the animal studies.
The logic was simple, says study author Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University who also helped develop GRADE. â€œWhat GRADE does is say we should rely on the highest quality evidence. In this instance, we had 600 cohort studies alone.â€
Cohort studies are considered to be more trustworthy than case-control studies. Unlike case-control studies, they follow people with a known exposure (eating meat) through time, waiting to see if, when, and how many people develop a particular health outcome (such as heart disease or cancer). This means researchers are not left searching for artificial controls to match their cases. And since participants are followed forward, researchers can track in real time what theyâ€™re eating instead of relying on peopleâ€™s faulty memories of the past.
Randomized controlled trials, meanwhile, are deemed the gold standard in health research. They take two groups of people and randomly assign them to an intervention (in this case, eating meat or not). The idea is that the only difference between the two is the intervention (whether or not they ate meat) and not any of those other confounding factors, like socioeconomic status. And while theyâ€™re challenging (and rare) in nutrition research, theyâ€™re generally more reliable than, say, animal models.
So thatâ€™s why the conclusions of the series look different from other similar reports: They used a new approach to evaluating nutrition research, picking out the best available evidence, tossing the rest.
On a range of health outcomes â€” from deaths due to cancer and cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes, cancer incidence, stroke, all-cause mortality, and heart attack â€” the researchers generally found either no benefit on cutting back on meat or one so small, and based on such weak evidence, it was deemed unreliable. (You can read the papers here, here, here, and here.) For the fifth review, the researchers looked at peopleâ€™s feelings about meat consumption, again focusing only on health concerns (read: not moral, ethical, or environmental reasons for avoiding meat). And they found, essentially, that many people are attached to meat, and feel being able to eat it influences their quality of life.
Even the best evidence in nutrition is far from perfect
But the authors were clear that even the best-available evidence on meat is far from perfect. Letâ€™s parse the language in their guideline recommendation (emphasis mine):
The panel suggests that adults continue current unprocessed red meat consumption (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Similarly, the panel suggests adults continue current processed meat consumption (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).
In GRADE, there are four levels of evidence. And evidence is rated down if itâ€™s deemed problematic for any reason â€” from imprecision to risk of being biased. In the case of meat and disease, the researchers determined, even the best evidence was â€œlow certainty.â€
BMJ
So, Guyatt said, â€œWeâ€™re closer to saying: we really donâ€™t know,â€ while past guidelines have generally suggested we fully understand meatâ€™s health effects.
Now letâ€™s look at what a â€œweak recommendationâ€ means, according to GRADE. Weirdly, this isnâ€™t just about the strength of the evidence; itâ€™s also about peopleâ€™s values and preferences.
A â€œstrong recommendationâ€ comes when a guideline panel believes all fully informed people would make the same choice. A â€œweakâ€ one comes when â€œthere is likely to be important variation in the decision that informed persons are likely to make,â€ according to a BMJ explainer on GRADE. As youâ€™ll remember, one of their Annals reviews looked at peopleâ€™s values and preferences around meat consumption, and found the majority of people value meat.
â€œWhen you trade that off with uncertain â€” and if it exists at all â€” small benefit from reducing meat,â€ Guyatt added, â€œour inference is that most people would choose to continue.â€ Hence, the weak recommendation.
In the past, he added, guidelines appeared to be focused on getting people to eat less meat rather than a truly dispassionate look at the science. â€œIt doesnâ€™t serve that goal well to point out either the uncertainty or the small effect.â€
Not everyone is sold on the researchersâ€™ approach
While people like the tough-to-please meta-researcher John Ioannidis called the series â€œvery rigorous and unbiased,â€ others were not as impressed.
The Harvard School of Public Health â€” well known for trumpeting a plant-based, Mediterranean eating pattern â€” issued a response to the series, essentially discrediting it for discounting all the evidence showing meatâ€™s links with poor health.
Christopher Gardner, a Stanford nutrition researcher, called the studyâ€™s GRADE approach inappropriate for nutrition. â€œI respect they want to have a clear-cut evidence base,â€ he told Vox, â€œbut it wonâ€™t apply to lifestyle.â€
Other guidelines consider observational epidemiology in additional to animal research and randomized trials, he added. â€œIf you do that â€” and youâ€™re the WHO â€” you say â€˜based on the overall evidence from multiple disciplines, this is our best advice,â€™â€ said Gardner. â€œ[The Annals researchers] just cut that off at the knees and said weâ€™re not going to consider most of that.â€ Specifically, he was concerned that the authors threw out important and potentially relevant research, such as the PREDIMED and the Lyon Diet Heart studies. While these randomized trials didnâ€™t focus on meat consumption, they did contain data on dietary patterns involving meat that may have been relevant.
Then there was the concern over the seriesâ€™ omission: meatâ€™s impact on climate, water, land, and pollution. â€œThis is a missed opportunity,â€ the Harvard researchers wrote, â€œbecause climate change and environmental degradation have serious effects on human health, and thus is important to consider when making recommendations on diet, even if this is addressed separately from direct effects on individual health.â€
But that wasnâ€™t the purpose of the studies, said Guyatt. The point was to zero in on the fraught question of meatâ€™s direct influence on health. Plus, he added, the new series is an attempt to do something radical: to say the rules of science should apply to nutrition. â€œWhy have one set of rules for judging [nutrition] and another set of rules for some other area?â€ he asked. As he and his colleagues continue to apply their new method to other dietary questions, they may lead us to more uncomfortable conclusions.

"The average CEO of an S&P 500 company made 287 times more than their median employee last year, and Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to force them to change that â€” or pay for it.
Sandersâ€™s presidential campaign unveiled its latest proposal to curb inequality in the United States Monday: An â€œIncome Inequality Taxâ€ on companies with massive pay disparities between the executive suite and the median worker.
The plan calls for increasing the corporate tax rate by half a percent on companies that pay their chief executives 50 times more than their median employee, and progressively hike up the corporate rate the bigger the inequality. The current corporate tax rate is 21 percent â€” the result of President Donald Trumpâ€™s corporate tax cut.
Under Sandersâ€™s proposal, if a CEO makes more than 100 times the median employee, their corporate tax rate increases 1 percent, to 22 percent; more than 200 times the median employee, the company pays an additional 2 percent on the corporate tax rate, and so on, up to a 5 percent increase to the corporate tax rate for companies that pay their CEOs more than 500 times the median employee.
â€œItâ€™s a sin tax,â€ said Sarah Anderson, with the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies, who previously worked with Sandersâ€™ Senate office on similar policy. â€œYou are hoping to reduce harmful behavior. We see these gaps as harmful to society at large...but we think that itâ€™s likely that some companies are so wedded to this idea that they have to pay their CEOs 100 times more than their workers â€”then they have to pay more in taxes.â€
This idea isnâ€™t new. Portland, Oregon has implemented a similar tax on a local level which fully went into effect last year. San Francisco plans to vote on a CEO tax measure next year, and similar proposals have been considered in Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Rhode Island. Federally, Reps. Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) introduced a bill proposing national CEO-to-worker pay ratio tax on publicly held companies in 2016. It has the backing of former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, as well as several leading economists on income inequality, like Thomas Piketty.
Sandersâ€™ team, however, is expanding on the idea, lowering the ratio companies would have to meet to avoid the tax, and extending it to both public and privately held companies with an annual revenue of more than $100 million. The campaign estimates the tax would raise $150 billion in revenue over 10 years, which Sanders wants to put toward his plan to eliminate $81 billion medical debt.
â€œIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you,â€ Sanders said in a statement.
Thereâ€™s a huge pay disparity between CEOs and workers

There are striking pay disparities between those in the C-suites of the biggest companies in the United States and the average workers.
An average American CEO at a S&P 500 company earned $14.5 million in 2018, the same year an average worker made $39,888. Over the last decade, CEOsâ€™ average pay has increased by $5.2 million. In ten years, the average American workerâ€™s pay hasnâ€™t even increased by $10,000, according to the AFL-CIO labor federationâ€™s analysis of the federal data.
A new IPS study found only five S&P 500 firms had CEO-to-worker pay ratios of less than 25 to 1. More shockingly, 49 of the 500 largest publicly traded firms have a median worker pay below the U.S. poverty line for a family of four. The median 2018 CEO pay at these 49 firms is $12.3 million.
Publicly held companies are required to file their CEO-to-worker pay ratios with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
These filings showed Walmart paid its CEO 1,076 times more than the median Walmart worker last year â€” $23.6 million to $21,952. Jeff Bezos gets paid 58 times the median Amazon worker. The CEO of the Gap makes a staggering 3,566 times what the clothing retailerâ€™s median worker makes. These are the companies that would get hit by Sandersâ€™s Income Inequality Tax. His plan would direct the Treasury to collect CEO-to-worker pay ratio data from privately held companies â€” and make it public â€” and also issue regulations around tax avoidance.
Proponents of such a tax argue that either companies will pay a fairer share in corporate taxes, or be forced to address their internal pay disparities, reallocating executivesâ€™ pay toward rank-and-file workers. So far, in the one jurisdiction that has implemented such a tax â€” Portland, Oregon â€” itâ€™s not clear the policy has had much of an impact on executivesâ€™ pay. But it has raised a fair bit of revenue.
Sanders campaign estimates McDonaldâ€™s would have paid up to $110.9 million more in taxes and Walmart would have paid up to $793.8 million more in taxes under this plan.
Critics, like the typically more conservative Chamber of Commerce, have been vocal in their opposition to similar plans, arguing that they would push companies to cut lower-wage jobs, prevent them from hiring highly-paid talent, send jobs overseas, or replace workers with contractors.
â€œPutting forward proposals that create barriers for businesses to attract and keep world-class talent will only hurt growth and job creation,â€ Tom Quaadman, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement about Sandersâ€™ proposal. â€œCandidates should instead work with the business community to create policies that will grow the economy and opportunities for all Americans.â€
It should be noted that SEC rules requires companies to account for offshore employees in their calculation of median pay. As Anderson and Sam Pizzigati, also with Institute for Policy Studies, pointed out, you â€œgotta wonder whoâ€™d still be around to keep shelves stocked and tables clean, especially since most big companies have already outsourced as many jobs as makes corporate bottom-line sense,â€ if companies were to let go of lower-waged workers to avoid the tax.
This kind of tax has been implemented on a local level

This kind of tax has been implemented on the local level with success.
Portland, Oregon has become the case study for cities and states around the country looking to address pay disparities at their biggest companies. Implemented fully in 2018, companies in Portland have to pay 10 percent more toward their business license tax if their CEOs make more than 100 times the median pay of employees. Companies that pay executives 250 times more than the median worker have to pay a 25 percent additional tax.
The city expects to raise $3.5 million with this tax.
In 2016, Thomas Piketty, an economist who tracks inequality in the United States, told the New York Times that the Portland tax could have been even more aggressive.
Corporations and Americaâ€™s wealthiest have seen a massive windfall under the Trump administration, which enacted massive corporate tax cuts â€” from 35 percent to just 21 percent â€” and reduced the top marginal tax rate. Since Republicans passed their tax cuts, corporations have spent billions buying back their own stock, and giving the riches to shareholders and investors, rather than workers.
â€œThis is certainly part of the solution,â€ Piketty told the Times of Portlandâ€™s plan then, â€œbut the tax surcharge needs to be large enough; the threshold â€˜100 timesâ€™ should be substantially lowered.â€
Sanders clearly agrees â€” his proposal cuts the threshold in half.
Update: This story has been updated with a comment from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."
"Elon Muskâ€™s tweets have gotten him into trouble.
A California judge ruled Friday that the Tesla CEO and other company executives have been illegally sabotaging employee efforts to form a union.
The administrative judge, Amita Tracy, pointed to 12 company actions that violated US labor laws. That includes letting security guards harass workers who were passing out union pamphlets in the parking lot, banning employees from wearing pro-union T-shirts and buttons, repeatedly interrogating union organizers, and eventually firing one of them.
Then there is the matter of Muskâ€™s tweets. The judge said several anti-union messages he posted on Twitter in May 2018 were illegal too. Like this one:
These are known as unfair labor practices. And what is the financial penalty for this? There isnâ€™t one.
Thatâ€™s because the law that governs collective bargaining doesnâ€™t let judges fine companies that break the law. Basically, Tesla just has to stop sabotaging union efforts and hire back the fired employee, plus pay him lost wages. Musk has to also read a notice to his employees saying that they have a right to unionize and that the company will not interfere with that. (Tesla has not yet responded to Voxâ€™s request for comment.)
If Tesla doesnâ€™t comply, the National Labor Relations Board, an independent federal agency that enforces collective bargaining laws, would have to petition a federal appeals court to enforce the order.
So this is more like a slap on the wrist.
Still, itâ€™s a big victory for workers who build Teslaâ€™s luxury electric cars. Since 2016, a group of them have been trying to form a labor union at the companyâ€™s factory in Fremont, California, which employs about 12,000 people. The organizers had complained about high injury rates and low wages and wanted to join the United Auto Workers union, which represents workers at GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler. Right now, Tesla is the only large US automaker without a unionized workforce.
But the company has made it nearly impossible for workers to organize. The new ruling from the National Labor Relations Board judge means workers will have a much better chance of forming a union to negotiate better pay and safer working conditions.
Workers were worried about their safety
In the fall of 2016, Jose Moran, a Tesla factory employee, reached out to United Auto Workers to ask about about starting a union. By early 2017, a group of organizers called it the Fair Future at Tesla campaign.
In February 2017, the effort went public when Moran wrote a blog post on Medium titled, â€œTime for Tesla to Listen.â€ He said factory workers were constantly getting hurt because the company made them work long hours on machinery that wasnâ€™t ergonomically safe. He also said the company had a shortage of workers and kept pushing employees to work faster. He then pointed out that Tesla employees were paid less than other employees in the auto industry and made the case for joining a labor union.
â€œI often feel like I am working for a company of the future under working conditions of the past,â€ Moran wrote in the blog post. It quickly caught the attention of Tesla executives, according to the NLRB complaint.
Tesla tried to sabotage union efforts
Tesla tried many different tactics to stop workers from forming a labor union.
The day after Moran published the blog post, he and three colleagues began distributing union leaflets in the factory parking lot during his time off. They were harassed by three security guards, who all took pictures of their badges, according to the complaint. The guards told the employees that they didnâ€™t have permission to be there, that they should leave.
Moran and his coworkers said they have a right to distribute the leaflets in the parking lot â€” and they do, according to the judge, Amita Tracy, who oversaw the administrative trial through the NLRB. The next month, in March, a supervisor warned employees that they could be fired if they distributed pro-union stickers and pamphlets â€” that was illegal, according to the judge.
In May, an HR representative questioned two union organizers about who accessed the companyâ€™s safety logs, which were the basis of a Guardian investigation of Teslaâ€™s high employee injury rate at the time.
In June, workers delivered a petition to Elon Musk, saying that they were worried about their safety at work and that they wanted to form a labor union.
â€œWe should come to work knowing we will return home to our families without being injured at work,â€ they wrote, according to the complaint.
The next day, Musk summoned Moran into his office. The head of HR, Gaby Toledano, was there, too. The CEO asked Moran and a coworker Moran brought with him to tell him about his job at Tesla. Moran described his job and explained the safety concerns he and his coworkers had. He also complained that he had good performance reviews but never received a raise for them.
Musk tried to discourage the employees, according to the complaint: â€œAccording to Moran, [Toledano] then said, â€˜You know, the majority of workers at Tesla donâ€™t want a union and, you know, why do we want to pay forâ€”why do we want to pay union dues?â€™ Moran responded that the employees have a right to form a union to have a voice to improve working conditions.â€
That was illegal, too.
In the following days, Musk suggested hiring Moran and other union organizers to work full-time on safety issues, according to copies of emails cited in the decision. Toledano said that was a good idea, mentioning that they wouldnâ€™t be able to unionize or advocate for a union if they were salaried employees.
â€œ[H]er emails show extensive discussion and steps Toledano took to move four pro-union employees to management so they could no longer advocate for the Union,â€ the judge wrote in the decision.
That was illegal, the judge decided, and it was also illegal when the company later began enforcing its dress code, barring workers who were wearing union T-shirts and buttons.
It was also illegal when Tesla fired one of Moranâ€™s coworkers for criticizing Tesla employees who spoke out against a union-backed bill in the California legislature.
But perhaps none of that did more damage than Muskâ€™s own involvement. On May 2018, he posted multiple anti-union message on Twitter, including one that suggested employees would no longer have stock options if they formed a union.
â€œMuskâ€™s tweet can only be read by a reasonable employee to indicate that if the employees vote to unionize that they would give up stock options. Musk threatened to take away a benefit enjoyed by the employees consequently for voting to unionize,â€ wrote the judge.
Among other things, Musk was ordered to read this to his employees:
â€œFederal law gives you the right to form, join, or assist a union, choose representatives to bargain with us on your behalf, act together with other employees for your benefit and protection, choose not to engage in any of these protected activities.â€
In all, the judge cited the company for violating US labor laws 12 different ways. But there is little incentive for Tesla to change its ways since there is no financial penalty involved."
"In the course of just two weeks, a previously unknown scandal sprawled to imperil Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency.
News broke that the Trump administration was withholding a mysterious whistleblower complaint from Congress on September 13. The chaotic days afterward were filled with leaks, revelations, document releases, and a new Democratic consensus in favor of an impeachment push.
So youâ€™d be forgiven for feeling a bit of whiplash ... and for having some questions.
Where did this whole thing come from? Why does this scandal, rather than so many other Trump scandals, appear to be catching on? Could it really mean the end of Trumpâ€™s presidency? And why is so much of American politics about Ukraine these days?
The Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal â€” it doesnâ€™t really have a catchy name yet â€” is about more than one phone call. Itâ€™s about a months-long effort by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to drum up foreign investigations into Trumpâ€™s political opponents.

To some extent, it involves multiple government agencies, including William Barrâ€™s Justice Department, Mike Pompeoâ€™s State Department, and Mick Mulvaneyâ€™s Office of Management and Budget. And it was worrying enough to spur a government employee to file a complaint and set things in motion.
Thereâ€™s much we still donâ€™t know about exactly what happened. But here is our basic understanding of the facts so far.
Your guide to the Donald Trump impeachment saga
Understand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here.
1) Whatâ€™s the short explanation of what this is all about?
Earlier this year, President Donald Trump pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate the potential 2020 Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
This pressure campaign from Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, lasted several months, and included both public and private demands on the Ukrainians. Trump also may have tried to punish Ukraine for not complying, including by holding up $400 million in US military aid the country was expecting.
A whistleblower within the US government became concerned about all this, and filed a complaint in mid-August. Since then, as more and more information has come out, itâ€™s developed into a massive scandal â€” one that spurred Speaker Nancy Pelosi to declare that the House of Representatives would conduct an â€œofficial impeachment inquiry.â€ And now, Trump appears to be in the greatest impeachment danger of his presidency so far.

2) So this is another collusion scandal?
In a sense, yes â€” it was a blatant attempt by the president to get a foreign country to take action that would influence the 2020 presidential election in Trumpâ€™s favor.
This, of course, is what many suspected Trump of having done with the Russian government in the 2016 election. Yet while Trump did publicly solicit Russiaâ€™s help â€œfindingâ€ Hillary Clintonâ€™s emails, no behind-the-scenes criminal conspiracy implicating anyone on Trumpâ€™s campaign was proven.
One major difference is that this time around, Trump isnâ€™t just a businessman and candidate. Heâ€™s now the president of the United States, with the power of that office behind him, and he appears to have abused that power to try to get what he wanted. Many have likened Trumpâ€™s actions to â€œextortionâ€ of Ukraine, rather than â€œcollusionâ€ with it.
Also, the scandal isnâ€™t just about what Trump himself did â€” itâ€™s now sprawled to encompass the White House, the State Department, the Justice Department, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Theyâ€™re all involved in either trying to respond to Trump and Giulianiâ€™s actions or dealing with the whistleblower complaint.
3) How did this all get started?
Over the past year or so, Rudy Giuliani â€” who was Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer for the Mueller investigation and has continued to represent him since â€” became increasingly fixated on the idea that he could get information in Ukraine that could help Trump politically.
Overall, he was looking for three types of information. First, he sought information that could be used to argue that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort was treated unfairly. Remember: Manafort was prosecuted by special counsel Robert Mueller for financial crimes related to work he did in Ukraine and is now in prison.
Second, Giuliani wanted information he thought could be used to advance the wild conspiracy theory that it wasnâ€™t Russia but Ukraine that hacked the email servers of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. And third, he was looking for dirt on Joe Biden and his son, Hunter (more on this in a minute).
In all three cases, Giuliani appears to have cared little about whether the information heâ€™d get was genuine or dubious.

But what began as an opposition research effort morphed into something more scandalous â€” because Giuliani latched on to the idea that he, the president of the United Statesâ€™s personal lawyer, could get the Ukrainian government to launch investigations that would help Trump. (Active investigations by the FBI into Hillary Clinton had proved extremely helpful to Trumpâ€™s campaign in 2016, so why not try something similar?)
Giuliani first tried to work with the previous Ukrainian government toward this end, but once an outsider presidential candidate, actor and comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, won Ukraineâ€™s presidential election in April 2019, Giulianiâ€™s efforts shifted toward pressuring the incoming government to do his â€” meaning, Trumpâ€™s â€” bidding.
Giuliani made some of his case in public; for instance, he told the New York Times in May that he was â€œmeddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,â€ and that he was looking for â€œinformationâ€ that could be â€œvery, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.â€
But his â€œshadow Ukraine agendaâ€ roiled the Trump administration, according to the Washington Post â€” for instance, the US ambassador to Ukraine may have been removed because she was unhelpful to Giulianiâ€™s dirt-digging efforts.
Trump also seemed to be trying to send a message to the new government. He told Zelensky in an April phone call to investigate â€œcorruption.â€ According to the whistleblowerâ€™s sources, Trump had Vice President Mike Pence cancel a planned trip to Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration in May.
Then around mid-July, Trump decided to hold up nearly $400 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine, directly telling his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who also heads the Office of Management and Budget, to do so. (Trump has denied the move was connected to his effort to pressure Zelensky, but the timing certainly is curious.)
All that set the stage for the remarkable phone call Trump had with Zelensky on July 25, summarized in a document the White House released last week. On the call, Trump repeatedly tells Zelensky to talk to Giuliani as well as Attorney General William Barr about these investigations (into the Bidens, and into the DNC server).
These requests are framed as Trump asking for a â€œfavorâ€ and come shortly after Trump talks about how much aid the US is giving to Ukraine. And this call was soon at the centerpiece of a bombshell whistleblower complaint.
4) How did we get from a secret whistleblower complaint to impeachment?
As word of Trumpâ€™s call with Zelensky circulated through the government in August, a CIA officer (who remains anonymous) became appalled enough by the apparent corruption to file a whistleblower complaint.
â€œIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,â€ the whistleblower wrote (in a complaint that was private at the time, but is now public, albeit redacted in part).
The complaint describes Trumpâ€™s call with Zelensky, and puts it in context with Trump and Giulianiâ€™s months-long pressure campaign on Ukraine. The whistleblower also alleges that White House lawyers took steps to â€œlock downâ€ records of Trumpâ€™s July 25 call with Zelensky by moving it to a separate electronic system intended only for highly sensitive intelligence information â€” raising fears of a cover-up.
â€œI was not a direct witness to most of the events described,â€ the whistleblower writes, saying instead that â€œmore than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort.â€

Because of this, Trump and Republicans have accused the whistleblower of spreading â€œhearsayâ€ â€” but the complaintâ€™s account of the Trump-Zelensky call matches very closely to the White Houseâ€™s own document summarizing the call, suggesting the whistleblower has good information.
The complaint was filed with the inspector general for the intelligence community, who determined it was â€œcredibleâ€ and a matter of â€œurgent concern.â€ That in turn was supposed to require the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to turn the complaint over to key members of Congress.
But instead, Maguire asked the White House and the Justice Department what to do â€” and, relying on DOJâ€™s advice, he didnâ€™t hand over the complaint.
While all this was going on, word spread that Trump was blocking the military aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved. The Pentagon was supposed to allot $250 million for weaponry, and the State Department was supposed to give $141 million for maritime security. But Trump had decreed both should be blocked, without giving any explanation. Lawmakers and department officials were alarmed, but couldnâ€™t get clear answers from the White House about why the money was being withheld.
On September 9, however, the intelligence community inspector general did his own whistleblowing of sorts, by writing a letter to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC), the congressional intelligence committee chairs, to tell them about the complaintâ€™s existence (though not its details). Then, on September 11, the White House suddenly decided to let the military aid go through.
Two days later, Schiff decided to go public, alleging a Trump administration cover-up. Over the next week and a half, details of the whistleblower complaintâ€™s subject matter gradually leaked out, until it became a full-blown public scandal.
And though Speaker Nancy Pelosi and moderate Democrats had been unenthusiastic about the idea of impeaching Trump all year, the news that Trump had been soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 election was a bridge too far.
So last week, Pelosi made it official that the House would conduct an impeachment inquiry â€” and now, House Democrats might impeach Trump by the end of the year. If they do so, that would lead to a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate.

5) So is what Trump did illegal?
As with many legal issues involving the president, this is disputed, and there are few clear precedents about it.
University of California Irvine law professor Rick Hasen has argued that Trump may have broken campaign finance law, by soliciting a â€œthing of valueâ€ for his 2020 campaign â€” the Biden investigation â€” from a foreign source.
The intelligence community inspector general also submitted a criminal referral on that topic to the Justice Department. But in mid-September, DOJâ€™s Criminal Division decided there was no need a full criminal investigation of Trump on this topic, arguing that the value of the Biden investigation couldnâ€™t be quantified.
Other theoretical possibilities include honest services fraud and extortion, though prosecuting the US president for supposedly victimizing a foreign government in such ways would be unprecedented to say the least. Surely no such prosecution would be brought by the current Justice Department, which has the position that the president cannot be indicted while in office. And Trump himself could argue that all this was carried out in the course of his constitutional foreign policy powers.
Practically, the answer doesnâ€™t matter much for now, both because the Justice Departmentâ€™s position is that they wonâ€™t indict a sitting president no matter what, and because congressional impeachment isnâ€™t really about lawbreaking.
The Constitution says the president can be impeached for treason, bribery, or â€œother high Crimes or Misdemeanors,â€ but leaves the definition of that final category vague.
But there are no evidentiary standards or necessity for legal grounding of impeachment articles â€” theyâ€™re a political action, determined by Congress. Practically, a majority of House members can impeach the president for whatever they want (if they have the votes).
6) Okay, so whatâ€™s the deal with the Biden allegation?
Now we must discuss Joe Bidenâ€™s neâ€™er-do-well son, Hunter.
Hunterâ€™s questionable ethical choices have been the subject of media scrutiny on and off for over 20 years. At age 26, Hunter took a high-paying job at Delaware-based bank MBNA. Five years later, he became a lobbyist. And then, after his father became vice president of the United States, Hunter moved into the more opaque world of highly paid â€œconsultingâ€ for foreign clients.
While he does have a Yale law degree, Hunter didnâ€™t appear to have any particularly relevant skills or business expertise. People seemingly just tended to hand him large sums of money because his father was first a prominent senator, then vice president, and then the 2020 Democratic frontrunner. A Chinese tycoon once even sent Hunter a large diamond. (â€œI knew it wasnâ€™t a good idea to take it,â€ Hunter later told the New Yorkerâ€™s Adam Entous.)
In 2014, Hunter joined the board of a scandal-plagued Ukrainian natural gas company named Burisma. Again, he had no apparent qualifications for the job, except that his father was the vice president and involved in the Obama administrationâ€™s Ukraine policy.
But he was paid as much as $50,000 in some months, and remained on the board until 2019. Nothing about this looks good â€” though, when assessing the genuineness of Trumpâ€™s professed outrage about the vice presidentâ€™s son, keep in mind that Trump is also regularly accepting payments from foreign sources to his company, while president, and so are the Trump children.

Fast-forward to 2016: Officials throughout the Obama administration and in Western Europe had come to a consensus that Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, wasnâ€™t doing enough to crack down on corruption there.
So the US ambassador at the time hatched a plan to hold up $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine unless the government pushed out Shokin. Biden, as he later colorfully recounted, delivered the Obama administrationâ€™s message â€” and indeed, Shokin was soon sacked.
Trump has been trying to argue that these two events â€” Hunter Bidenâ€™s work on Burismaâ€™s board, and Joe Bidenâ€™s role in the effort to oust prosecutor general Shokin â€” were connected in a corrupt way: that Biden got rid of the prosecutor to protect his sonâ€™s company from being investigated.
Shokin himself has made this allegation, saying he was actually fired because he was too good at investigating Burisma and Hunter Bidenâ€™s corruption. The question of whether Shokin had a serious investigation of Burisma going on before his firing is murky and disputed. But thereâ€™s no evidence at all that Joe Bidenâ€™s actions were motivated by this concern. â€œEveryone in the Western community wanted Shokin sacked,â€ Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal.
Still, Trump and Giuliani embraced the theory, seeing a potential scandal that could dog Trumpâ€™s possible 2020 opponent. And they demanded the Ukrainian government investigate it.
7) Wait, back up. How did Ukraine end up being at the center of this whole saga?
Well, thatâ€™s a very tangled tale indeed.
To understand how we got here, you need to go back to February 2014, when Ukraineâ€™s Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, was deposed following massive protests in Kyiv.
The US interpretation was that Yanukovych was a corrupt puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin and was ousted by a legitimate popular uprising; the Russian interpretation, on the other hand, was that he was a legitimately elected leader deposed by a Western plot.

This was a reasonably big story in the US at the time, but nobody could have expected it would set off a lengthy chain reaction that has somehow, incredibly, dominated the past half-decade of American politics.
To simplify, what happened next was:
Russia invaded Ukraine and seized some of its territory, beginning a military conflict that continues to this day.
The Obama administration reacted by slapping harsh sanctions on Russia.
Russia then interfered in the 2016 US presidential election, including by hacking and leaking leading Democratsâ€™ emails.
The FBI, alarmed by the Russian interference effort and suspicious that Trump or members of his campaign could be involved, opened the probe that eventually became the Mueller investigation, and would loom over the first two years of Trumpâ€™s presidency.
Mueller zeroed in on Trumpâ€™s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, who had spent nearly a decade doing well-compensated work for that now-deposed pro-Russian Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
While Mueller did not end up charging Manafort with any crimes related to â€œcollusion,â€ he did prosecute and convict Manafort with failing to pay taxes on $30 million of laundered money from his Ukraine work.
Trumpâ€™s team, meanwhile, cast about for dirt that could be used either to discredit the Mueller investigation or to concoct competing scandals about Democrats. Eventually, they too began to fixate on Ukraine â€” both because Manafortâ€™s allies there continued to circulate various conspiracy theories, and because it turned out that 2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Bidenâ€™s son had his own curious Ukrainian business dealings.
This year, then, Trump and Giuliani tried to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden. That spurred a whistleblower inside the US government to file a complaint about this pressure campaign.
And now the House of Representatives may be barreling toward impeaching President Trump as a result.
Essentially, a butterfly flapped its wings in Kyiv five and a half years ago, and now thereâ€™s a tornado in Washington, DC.
8) Out of so many Trump scandals, why is this one catching on?
All year, many Democrats have grown hoarse from shouting that Trump should be impeached for so many reasons: the apparent obstruction of justice offenses outlined in the Mueller report, the corruption involved in Trumpâ€™s continued ownership of his business while president, his seeming violation of campaign finance law with hush money payments, his bigotry, the administrationâ€™s family separation policy, and his general erratic behavior and unfitness of character.
So it may seem surprising that this Ukraine scandal would end up being the thing that finally tipped the party toward fully embracing an impeachment inquiry. But there appear to be several reasons why this is the case.
Like the Mueller investigation, the Ukraine scandal involves secret information and shadowy conspiracies involving a foreign government, and has stoked intense media coverage (that other more banal Trump corruption unfolding in plain sight doesnâ€™t end up getting).
But unlike the Mueller probe, this scandal is about Trump trying to interfere with the next election (not a previous one) â€” which adds new outrage and also urgency among Democrats to do something to stop him, rather than stand aside and signal that this is acceptable.
The news is also unfolding in a political context in which Democrats have faced enormous pressure from their base for months to impeach Trump. Most of the partyâ€™s House caucus had already backed an impeachment inquiry before this, and Pelosi and other moderates who didnâ€™t were battling against the tide. So when presented with a new damning scandal, they decided to finally stop worrying and love impeachment.
Finally, thereâ€™s a general agreement that the particular facts here are just tougher for Trump to defend. Unlike the Russia scandal, when Trump could claim â€œno collusionâ€ and deny the underlying allegation happened, here he is in an official White House document clearly telling the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden. Heâ€™s admitted making the ask, heâ€™s just denying that there was a quid pro quo involved.
9) Is this the end of Trump?
Who knows? Not me, certainly.
It does appear to be the gravest political threat heâ€™s faced in some time. But, still ... probably not?
The road after impeachment, if it does happen, leads to the United States Senate, where it takes a two-thirds vote â€” 67 senators â€” to actually remove a president from office (and replace him with the vice president, currently Mike Pence).
Currently, there are 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the Senate. So assuming that every Democratic senator votes to remove Trump (not a sure thing, given that some come from deeply conservative states), 20 Republican votes would also be needed.
This would be an utter collapse of party support for the president unlike anything weâ€™ve seen, well, since Watergate brought down Richard Nixon. And impeachment superfans are hopeful that it will happen again, to Trump.

The problem is the continued loyalty of the Republican voter base to Trump. His approval rating among GOP voters is regularly above 80 percent. These are the voters who turn out in Republican primaries that Republican senators and members of Congress have to win to keep their jobs. â€œOur voters want two things from their congressmen: [dumping] on the media and blindly defending the president,â€ a senior Senate Republican aide recently told the Los Angeles Times.
Last week, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) called the scandal â€œdeeply troubling,â€ but the other GOP senators have been mum or outright defended Trump. Getting anywhere near 20 GOP votes to remove Trump from office would require an utter collapse of support for the president among GOP voters, or a sudden outbreak of conscience among GOP senators. Either path would require further, even more damning revelations, and even then neither is likely.
So yes, Trump is still quite likely to remain in office and be on the ballot in 2020 ... unless things change a whole lot more.

"President Trump says he wants to confront his â€œaccuser.â€
That was one of the many demands the president issued in a series of enraged tweets over the last few days. â€œLike every American,â€ Trump tweeted on Sunday, â€œI deserve to meet my accuser, especially when this accuser, the so-called â€˜whistleblower,â€™ represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way.â€
Trumpâ€™s demand to face the person accusing him struck many observers as ironic, given that at least one person accusing Trump of crimes is quite eager to face him in court.
Summer Zervos, a restaurant owner and former contestant on The Apprentice, alleges Trump sexually assaulted her in 2007. Sheâ€™s one of at least 22 women â€” including, most recently, author and advice columnist E. Jean Carroll â€” who has alleged sexual misconduct by Trump (the president has denied all allegations). Zervos sued Trump in 2017 for calling her a liar when she came forward with her allegation, and ever since, sheâ€™s been fighting to take him to court.
Although itâ€™s the whistleblower report that finally triggered an impeachment inquiry against Trump, his recent tweets are a reminder that the list of allegations against him is long â€” and includes the testimony of at least one woman who would be only too happy to meet him in a court of law, should he give her the chance.
Trumpâ€™s tweet is a reminder that he has many â€œaccusersâ€
When Trump tweeted about his desire to â€œmeet my accuser,â€ the response from critics was swift. Karine Jean-Pierre, chief public affairs officer for the liberal group MoveOn, simply tweeted a list of some of the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, including Zervos.
Many of these women came forward after the October 2016 release of the Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump was heard bragging about his ability to grab women â€œby the pussy.â€ He at first dismissed the comments as â€œlocker-room talkâ€ â€” but multiple women soon stated publicly that he had, in fact, grabbed, touched, or kissed them without their consent.
There was Jessica Leeds, who said Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt when they were seated on a flight together in the 1980s. â€œHe was like an octopus,â€ she told the New York Times. â€œHis hands were everywhere.â€
There was Natasha Stoynoff, who said that when she visited Mar-a-Lago to write a People magazine story about Trump in 2005, he pushed her up against a wall and forced his tongue down her throat. Melania Trump was pregnant at the time.
And there was Summer Zervos, who said Trump invited her to dinner with him at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2007. She went, hoping for career help. Instead, she said, Trump brought her to his private bungalow, where he touched her breast and pressed his genitals against her.
After she went public with her story in 2016, Trump said that â€œevery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign.â€ His campaign also released a statement from Zervosâ€™s cousin, arguing she was making up the allegations as a way to get famous.
Zervos sued Trump for defamation in January 2017. But his lawyers argued that, because she filed her suit in state court in New York, it should be thrown out. They claimed that although a sitting president can be sued in federal court (Paula Jonesâ€™s lawsuit against Bill Clinton established that), it is illegal to sue a president in state court. Theyâ€™ve lost at every step â€” most recently, in March, a New York appeals court ruled that Zervosâ€™s suit could go forward.

Meanwhile, the list of allegations against Trump continues to grow. Most recently, E. Jean Carroll wrote in her new book What Do We Need Men For?, excerpted in New York magazine, that Trump sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in 1995 or 1996. Trump denied the allegation and insulted Carroll, saying â€œsheâ€™s not my type.â€
Trumpâ€™s claim that he deserves to meet the whistleblower who raised the alarm about his communications with Ukraine reads as an attempt to intimidate that person, especially given Trumpâ€™s previous comments on this issue. At a private event last week, Trump described the whistleblower, whose identity is not publicly known, as â€œalmost a spy,â€ and said, â€œwe used to handle [spies and treason] a little differently than we do now.â€ Similarly, Trump has tried to intimidate the women who came forward with misconduct allegations, saying in 2016 that â€œall of these liars will be sued after the election is over.â€
The tweet is also a reminder that while the matter with Ukraine is the basis for the current impeachment inquiry, itâ€™s far from the first serious allegation lodged against the president. And of the nearly two dozen women who have accused him of assaulting or harassing them, Trump has so far faced no consequences for their allegations."
"On Sunday night and Monday morning, President Donald Trump took to Twitter and casually suggested that one of his political rivals â€” House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) â€” be investigated and then arrested for treason for comments made during a committee hearing last week.
In the hearing, Schiff paraphrased, in exaggerated fashion, the partial transcript released by the Trump White House of Trumpâ€™s call with the president of Ukraine, in which he requests that Ukraine revive an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Schiffâ€™s version went quite a bit further than the actual text of the readout, as CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale explains here; in Schiffâ€™s version, Trump asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to â€œmake up dirt on my political opponent,â€ whereas Trump only asked for further investigation and did not explicitly demand that Zelensky make up dirt.
But in Trumpâ€™s judgment, Schiff was not merely exaggerating but uttering â€œlies â€¦ made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamberâ€ (by which Trump presumably means the US Capitol Building, which is not where the Schiff hearing took place):
This hardly needs to be said, but Adam Schiff is not guilty of treason. Neither are the people who gave the whistleblower the information about Trumpâ€™s dealings with Ukraine, despite what Trump thinks. Nor is the FBI, another Trump target in the past.
And, it must be said, neither is Donald Trump, unless it comes out that he was planning a literal war against the US with some other country.
Treason is a specific charge with a specific meaning, with which a tiny handful of people have been charged, and which basically nobody apart from maybe al-Qaeda members meets in a modern context.
What the Constitution says about treason
Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution defines treason as follows:
Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.
As UC Davisâ€™ Carlton Larson, one of the few experts on treason law in academia today, explained to me back in 2013, this language provides for two types of treason prosecutions.
The first is an â€œaid and comfortâ€ prosecution, in which the defendant is accused of aiding the war effort of a country presently at war with the United States. Iva Toguri, who was convicted of treason after the government accused her of being â€œTokyo Rose,â€ an English-language Japanese propaganda broadcaster meant to lower American service membersâ€™ morale in the Pacific, faced an aid and comfort prosecution; she was later exonerated and received a presidential pardon. The American Nazi propagandist Robert Henry Best was convicted after an aid and comfort prosecution in 1948.
The second type of treason prosecution involves â€œlevying war,â€ in which the defendants themselves waged war against the United States or an individual state. Aaron Burr, Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s first vice president, was prosecuted for treason on these grounds and acquitted, after being accused of assembling forces to create an independent state in the center of North America. John Brown, the abolitionist revolutionary, was convicted of treason against the state of Virginia on levying war grounds after his raid on Harpers Ferry.
Now, Schiff is not going to face a levying war prosecution. That leaves the claim that he provided aid and comfort to our enemies by misquoting the president.
This is obviously preposterous but letâ€™s keep going with it for a second. The prosecution would have to name a specific enemy to whom Schiff is lending aid and comfort. It canâ€™t be Ukraine or Russia because neither of those countries is an enemy of the US. The aid and comfort charge is only applicable when the United States is at war, as it was against Japan and Germany in World War II. Itâ€™s not applicable at all when the US is not engaged in an active military conflict.
This remains true in situations where the country in question is a geopolitical rival of the US. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union but they were not charged with treason â€” because the US was not at war with the Soviet Union. Aldrich Ames, the CIA officer turned Soviet spy, got at least 10 people killed through his actions, and FBI Russian spy Robert Hanssen indirectly got at least three killed, but neither was charged with treason because the US was not at war with the Soviet Union/Russian Federation at the time of their actions.
Even if the US were at war with Russia, the treason allegation would be iffy. Consider the 1945 Supreme Court case of Cramer v. United States, where Anthony Cramer, an American man who met with Nazi agents in the US, saw his treason conviction overturned on the grounds that merely meeting the enemy isnâ€™t enough to count as treason.
In his opinion in that case, Justice Robert Jackson asserted that only a defendant who can be found to have â€œadhered to the enemyâ€ and â€œintended to betrayâ€ the US could be found guilty of treason â€” even if he did provide aid and comfort to the enemy.
Proving that Schiff not only provided aid and comfort but also consciously intended to betray the United States of America is basically impossible. Trump is, once again, making a baseless accusation.
Investigating Schiff could have downsides for Trump
Indeed, there is an argument to be made that a Trump decision to launch an investigation into Schiff for comments made in a House hearing would itself be an impeachable offense, as UMass Amherst political scientist Paul Musgraves has argued. The Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution (Article I, Section 6, Clause 1) states that members of Congress â€œshall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their attendance at the Session of their Respective Houses, and in going to and from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.â€
In practice, the Supreme Court has ruled that this means members of Congress have immunity from questioning and prosecution for activities they undertake in the course of legislating, such as conducting committee hearings. That immunity is not unlimited; the Supreme Court ruled that the reading of the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional record by then-Sen. Mike Gravel was not legislative activity that was protected. But the Courtâ€™s ruling in Gravel v. United States makes it clear that Schiffâ€™s conduct qualifies and would be exempt from criminal prosecution:
We recognize today â€” as the Court has recognized before, Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. at 103 U. S. 204; Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 341 U. S. 377-378 (1951) â€” that a Memberâ€™s conduct at legislative committee hearings, although subject to judicial review in various circumstances, as is legislation itself, may not be made the basis for a civil or criminal judgment against a Member because that conduct is within the â€œsphere of legitimate legislative activity.â€
The Speech and Debate clause has roots going back, as Felix Frankfurter wrote in his opinion in Tenney v. Brandhove, to at least the English Civil War, where among the parliamentariansâ€™ grievances against Charles I were his prosecutions for seditious speech in parliament. The clause is specifically there to protect members of Congress from groundless prosecution by the executive for speech that the executive does not like. In other words, it exists for exactly this situation, to protect the Adam Schiffs of the world against the Donald Trumps of the world.
If Trump were to try to prosecute Schiff for his comments anyway, he would likely be running afoul of the Speech and Debate clause, and his violation of the clause could constitute one of the articles of impeachment considered and/or approved by the House. The House passed an article of impeachment against Andrew Johnson in 1868 (article 10) that specifically cited his insults against members of Congress; this article went nowhere in the Senate and did not specifically cite the Speech and Debate clause, but provides some potential precedent for impeachment on these grounds."
"Thereâ€™s a new member of the Trump administration. His name is Eugene Scalia, and heâ€™s the now the US labor secretary. Heâ€™s also the son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, known for his hard-line views against abortion and affirmative action.
The Senate confirmed the 56-year-old lawyer Thursday for the role, which puts him in charge of enforcing workers rights and US labor laws. That includes laws meant to protect workers from unsafe workplaces, wage theft, overtime violations, and employee misclassification.
However, like many people Trump nominates to head federal departments, Scalia doesnâ€™t have a great track record of fighting for the people or institutions heâ€™s supposed to protect â€” which in this case is workers.
Democrats and labor leaders have been protesting Scaliaâ€™s nomination to the top labor role ever since former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned in July. Acosta was pressured to step down following scrutiny of how he handled a sex crimes case involving the financier Jeffrey Epstein, back when Acosta was a federal prosecutor in Florida.
Though Acosta was hardly a workersâ€™ champion, US labor leaders are worried that Scalia will work even harder to undo worker protections put in place under the Obama administration.
Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO union federation, said Thursday that Scaliaâ€™s nomination was â€œinsulting, itâ€™s dangerous, and workers are not going to forget it.â€ He also warned that the move would hurt Trump in the 2020 elections.
Scalia, for his part, promised senators during his confirmation hearing that he will look out for workers, and that his experience defending corporations has nothing to do with how he will enforce labor laws. Whether or not thatâ€™s true will be clear after he moves into his new office at the Labor Department.
In the meantime, here are five things to know about the new labor secretary.
1) Heâ€™s a corporate lawyer whoâ€™s spent his career fighting against workers
Scalia has spent the past 20 years working as a high-profile lawyer in the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher, a prominent corporate law firm. His legal record involves fighting labor laws on behalf of Americaâ€™s largest businesses, including Wall Street banks, Walmart, and SeaWorld.
Back in 2006, he helped Walmart and other corporations win a lawsuit against the state of Maryland, which would have required large companies to contribute to their employeesâ€™ health care plans or to Medicaid.
In 2011, he championed Boeingâ€™s threats to move jobs to a so-called â€œright-to-workâ€ state during contract negotiations with a labor union. Right-to-work laws weaken labor unions because they let workers at unionized workplaces opt out of paying union fees.
Scalia also defended UPS against widespread discrimination claims, killing a major class action lawsuit filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act, according to the AFL-CIO. He also represented now-disgraced casino mogul Steve Wynn when he was accused of stealing tips from his Las Vegas employees.
In one of his most notable cases, Scalia argued that SeaWorld had no responsibility for the violent death of one of its orca trainers, choosing instead to blame the victim.
2) Scalia has a gift for unraveling consumer and worker protections
Scalia has earned a reputation in legal circles as an aggressive litigator against government rules. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal described him as â€œone of the industryâ€™s go-to guys for challenging financial regulations.â€
Scalia played a central role in getting a federal judge to overturn the Obama Labor Departmentâ€™s fiduciary rule, which required financial advisers to consider only the best interests of their client when providing retirement advice, regardless of commissions or fees. His client in both the fiduciary rule fight and campaign finance reform efforts was the US Chamber of Commerce.
Scalia also sued the government repeatedly on behalf of big banks to unravel Doddâ€“Frank consumer protections after the Great Recession.
3) He famously helped overturn a labor rule to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome
Scalia is probably best known for his campaign against the Clinton-era ergonomics rule.
As a lawyer, he often dismissed the science linking repetitive motion and physical injuries suffered by workers, writing in a Cato Institute report that disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome are supposedly caused by typing but that â€œergonomists cannot establish in any given case whether an ailment was caused by work or by genetic factors or other activities, such as sports.â€
Scalia argued in a series of writings and public comments in 2001 that the rule was too vague and would result in the agency becoming overreaching and intrusive.
He had a cynical view of the role of labor unions played in crafting the ergonomics rule, writing in a 2000 Wall Street Journal op-ed â€œthat ergonomic regulation will force companies to give more rest periods, slow the pace of work and then hire more workers (read: dues-paying members) to maintain current levels of production.â€ The rule was overturned in 2001 in Congress.
4) He is a member of the right-wing legal group Federalist Society
Scalia is a member of the Federalist Society, just like his father was. The conservative legal group has amassed enormous influence within the Trump administration. The organization has recommended countless judicial appointees to the president and then played a key role in their confirmations. The group was very involved in the confirmation process of Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Many Democrats view the Federalist Society as a right-wing, corporate-friendly organization determined to undermine the federal government.
The Federalist Society â€œunderstands the fundamental power through the federal judiciary, to rig the system in favor of special interests,â€ said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) during a speech in May.
Scaliaâ€™s membership in the group suggests he would continue fighting for corporate interests as head of the Department of Labor.
5) Heâ€™s done one or two good things for workers
During his confirmation hearing this month, according to the Washington Post, Scalia argued that he also has a record of advocating for workers. He pointed out that during a brief stint as the Department of Laborâ€™s chief lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, he fought for a group of poultry workers who were not paid for the time they spent putting on their safety gear before work.
He also said during the hearing that it is â€œfundamentalâ€ for workers to have the choice to join a labor union, and said he believed that labor unions were â€œamong the most effective advocates you will see for workplace safety and health.â€
â€œIâ€™ve written that there are some workplaces where the best thing you could have for achieving the best terms and conditions of employment will be a labor union,â€ Scalia said during the hearing, according to the Post. â€œThey play an important role.â€
However, a few kind words for labor unions hardly cancel out decades spent fighting workers in court.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Sen. Sheldon Whitehouseâ€™s constituency. He represents the state of Rhode Island."
"The whistleblower complaint that suddenly placed Trump in the greatest danger of impeachment of his presidency so far has now been revealed.
The key allegation is stated up front: â€œI have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,â€ the whistleblower wrote, in a letter dated August 12, 2019. (You can read it at this link.)
The well-written, detailed, and footnoted complaint alleges a months-long effort by President Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Some parts of that pressure campaign played out in public view, and others of which happened behind closed doors.
The centerpiece of the complaint is the whistleblowerâ€™s recounting of what transpired during Trumpâ€™s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But it also describes an apparent White House cover-up to hide records of that call, and lays out other troubling events that occurred both before and after that call.

The whistleblower admitted that they were â€œnot a direct witness to most of the events described,â€ but were rather â€œinformedâ€ of these various facts by â€œmore than half a dozen U.S. officialsâ€ in the course of their work. But the whistleblowerâ€™s information appears to be quite good â€” on Wednesday, the White House released an internal document summarizing the Trump and Zelensky call that closely matches the whistleblowerâ€™s description.
The biggest new revelation is the whistleblowerâ€™s allegation that, per White House officials, White House lawyers â€œdirectedâ€ them to remove the word-for-word transcript of the Trump and Zelensky call from the usual computer system. Instead, they placed it in a separate computer system reserved for very sensitive intelligence information â€” in an apparent effort to prevent word of what actually happened on the call from getting out.
The overall takeaway is that, based on what has already emerged, many if not most of the whistleblowerâ€™s allegations were right on target. Trump did try to get a foreign leader to investigate his potential opponent in the 2020 election. The questions remaining are about how wide-ranging this effort was, and what the White House did, if anything, to cover it up. (As well as, of course, whether all this merits impeachment.)

Who is the whistleblower, and what does this complaint look like?
We donâ€™t know who this whistleblower is â€” only that he or she is a member of the US intelligence community. But, judging by the complaint, the person appears to regularly discuss policy toward Ukraine with other US government officials, and hears quite a lot about internal deliberations within the White House and State Department on this subject.
The complaint itself is nine pages long. Itâ€™s addressed to Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairs of the House and Senate intelligence committees, but was submitted to the inspector general for the intelligence community, in accordance with a law governing intelligence whistleblower complaints.
Interestingly, the whistleblower appears to have anticipated an attempt to suppress the complaint. The complaint was written so that the first seven pages would be unclassified, with classified information only included in a separate two-page â€œenclosure.â€ Early on, the whistleblower mentions the possibility that the administration could try to classify more information retroactively â€” and says in that case, it would be â€œincumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why.â€
To the best of my knowledge, the entirety of this statement is unclassified when separated from the classified enclosure. I have endeavored to apply the classification standards outlined in Executive Order (EO) 13526 and to separate out information that I know or have reason to believe is classified for national security purposes.
â€¢ If a classification marking is applied retroactively, I believe it is incumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why such a marking was applied, and to which specific information it pertains.
Indeed, the administration did end up trying to block the complaint from being given to Congress, as was seemingly required by law. But the inspector general for the intelligence community went to Congress himself, and the resulting outcry was so great that the administration agreed to release the complaint this week.
In the end, the version of the complaint declassified and publicly released Thursday was almost entirely unredacted. That includes that two-page classified enclosure â€” except for one brief section and its accompanying footnote or footnotes. Those are blacked out and marked as related to â€œclassified intelligence community reporting and analysis.â€
The centerpiece of the complaint is a description of Trumpâ€™s July call with Zelensky
After that brief introduction, the whistleblower launches into a detailed description of Trumpâ€™s now-infamous July 25 call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
The whistleblower did not hear the call or review the transcript, but he or she did â€œreceive a readoutâ€ of it and talk to numerous White House officials about it â€” and those White House officials were â€œdeeply disturbedâ€ about what happened, because they had â€œwitnessedâ€ Trump â€œabuse his office for personal gain.â€
The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call. They told me that there was already a â€œdiscussion ongoingâ€ with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officialsâ€™ retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.
Some Trump defenders have seized on the whistleblowerâ€™s lack of firsthand knowledge about the call â€” but the criticism doesnâ€™t really hold water, since the White House released their own internal document summarizing the call Wednesday, and it closely matches the whistleblowerâ€™s description.
The whistleblower alleges what we now know from that document to be true:
Trump â€œpressuredâ€ Zelensky to â€œinitiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Bidenâ€
Trump also pressured Zelensky to investigate the origins of the FBIâ€™s Russian interference investigation, including by making a bizarre claim that Ukraine has a Democratic email server
And Trump told Zelensky to meet or speak with both his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr, â€œmultiple times in tandem.â€
Again, all this is not even disputed at this point. Here, for instance, is Trump requesting Zelensky work with Barr to investigate Biden and his son, per the (non-verbatim) official summary of the call.
The other thing, thereâ€™s a lot of talk about Bidenâ€™s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.
So the whistleblower was on target here. Similarly, the (again, non-verbatim) call summary shows Trump asked Zelensky to talk to Barr or Giuliani at least five separate times regarding these investigations.
â€œI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of itâ€
â€œMr. Giuliani is a highly respected man... and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General...â€
â€œWhatever you can do with the Attorney General would be greatâ€
â€œI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr callâ€
â€œI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to callâ€
But the whistleblowerâ€™s complaint is broader than just one phone call â€” it goes on to make allegations of an apparent White House cover-up around the call, and then it tries to put Trumpâ€™s behavior toward Ukraine in broader context.

The complaint also alleges a White House cover-up
â€œIn the days following the phone call,â€ the whistleblower continues, â€œI learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to â€˜lock downâ€™ all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript.â€
Specifically, he or she says, White House officials say they were â€œdirectedâ€ by White House lawyers â€œto remove the electronic transcript from the computer system in which such transcripts are typically stored for coordination, finalization, and distribution to Cabinet-level officials.â€
Instead, the transcript was placed in a â€œseparateâ€ electronic system intended for â€œespecially sensitiveâ€ material. The goal here appears to have been to ensure that the transcript didnâ€™t circulate widely within the government. But, per the whistleblower, concerns were voiced internally that this was an â€œabuseâ€ of the system, designed to protect Trump politically. And according to White House officials, the whistleblower complains, this was â€œnot the first timeâ€ the system was used in this way to shield a politically damaging â€œPresidential transcript.â€
According to multiple White House officials I spoke with, the transcript of the Presidentâ€™s call with President Zelenskyy was placed into a computer system managed directly by the National Security Council (NSC) Directorate for Intelligence Programs. This is a standalone computer system reserved for codeword-level intelligence information, such as covert action. According to information I received from White House officials, some officials voiced concerns internally that this would be an abuse of the system and was not consistent with the responsibilities of the Directorate for Intelligence Programs. According to White House officials I spoke with, this was â€œnot the first timeâ€ under this Administration that a Presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive â€” rather than national security sensitive â€” information.
One question here is whether the â€œofficial word-for-word transcriptâ€ of the call the whistleblower is referring to is the same call summary document that was released on Wednesday by the White House. That document is written like a transcript, but it has a note stating itâ€™s not a verbatim transcript, and also contains ellipses in certain sections. (The White House has said these are meant to be conversational pauses.)
So there are two possibilities. One is that the whistleblower was being inexact in referring to a â€œword-for-wordâ€ transcript, and we already have the document in question. The other is that there is still an exact word-for-word transcript hidden away somewhere. (The released summary document was allegedly â€œdeveloped with assistance from voice recognition software,â€ so apparently there was audio used at some point.) Either is possible, and it would be good to find out which is the case.
Beyond that, there are naturally more questions to be asked about which White House officials were involved in this apparent cover-up â€” and whether there were in fact other times Trump call transcripts were hidden away for political reasons, as the complaint alleges.
The whistleblower also tries to put Trumpâ€™s actions toward Ukraine in a broader context
Finally, the complaint spends several pages laying out the context for Trumpâ€™s call with Zelensky â€” telling a damning story, based partly on public events and partly on nonpublic information, about a concerted pressure effort.
The whistleblower traces the saga back to March 2019, when Ukraineâ€™s then-prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, made a series of allegations to an American conservative journalist, John Solomon of The Hill. These allegations were about the two main topics Giuliani wanted to investigate â€” how the FBIâ€™s Russia investigation got started, and the Biden familyâ€™s Ukraine dealings.

The whistleblower suggests these allegations were garbage. â€œMr. Lutsenko has no legal training and has been widely criticized in Ukraine for politicizing criminal probes and using his tenure as Prosecutor General to protect corrupt Ukrainian officials,â€ he or she writes. The implication is that because Lutsenko was about to lose his job as prosecutor general â€” due Zelenskyâ€™s lead in the polls â€” he was making up nonsense to try and get the Trump administration to help him keep his job.
But all this was exactly what Giuliani wanted to hear. As the whistleblower chronicles, Giuliani bragged repeatedly in media appearances that these Ukrainian investigations were bombshell news. Unfortunately for him, though, Zelensky won the election â€” and he had pledged to fire Lutsenko as prosecutor general.
Thatâ€™s the background for Trump and Giulianiâ€™s effort to put the squeeze on Zelensky, and demand his administration keep pursuing the investigations that could help Trump politically. Per the whistleblower:
â€œMultiple U.S. officials told me that the Ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the President and President Zelenskyy would depend on whether Zelenskyy showed willingness to â€˜play ballâ€™ on the issues publicly aired by Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Giuliani.â€
Multiple US officials â€œwere deeply concerned by what they viewed as Mr. Giulianiâ€™s circumvention of national security decisionmaking process to engage with Ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between Kyiv and the President.â€
Around May 14, Trump instructed Pence to â€œcancel his planned travel to Ukraineâ€ to attend Zelenskyâ€™s inauguration, according to US officials.
The complaint also mentions â€” briefly â€” the questions surrounding Trumpâ€™s decision to block US military aid to Ukraine. The whistleblower didnâ€™t know many details about this, but mentions the move as potentially connected to Trumpâ€™s efforts to pressure Zelensky.
On 18 July, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official informed Departments and Agencies that the President â€œearlier that monthâ€ had issued instructions to suspend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. Neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why this instruction had been issued. During interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, OMB officials again stated explicitly that the instruction to suspend this assistance had come directly from the President, but they still were unaware of a policy rationale. As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it.
The document summarizing Trump and Zelenskyâ€™s July call revealed that the topic of US military aid for Ukraine was in fact brought up in their discussion â€” right before Trump asked Zelensky for a â€œfavor.â€
Finally, the whistleblower adds some further details on what happened after that July 25 call. Specifically, on the next day, two US State Department officials â€” Kurt Volker, the special representative for Ukraine negotiations, and Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU â€” met Zelensky and advised him how to â€œnavigateâ€ Trumpâ€™s demands. The whistleblower also says that Giuliani met a Zelensky adviser in Madrid about a week later, something that was not public at the time (but has since been confirmed).
The whistleblower also describes an August 9 public statement from Trump to reporters, in which he called Zelensky a â€œreasonable guyâ€ and suggested he would be invited to the White House soon. And that appears to have been the final straw â€” because he or she filed this complaint just three days later.

"The transcript summary of President Donald Trumpâ€™s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released on Wednesday makes one thing perfectly clear: Ukraine has replaced Russia as the foreign nation that will most be on Americansâ€™ lips in the weeks ahead.
Trump is embroiled in a crisis about whether he improperly used his position to try to coerce Zelensky into investigating Trumpâ€™s 2020 political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden â€” perhaps by withholding military aid to the Eastern European country.
That seems possible based on the call summary, which shows Zelensky asking for US-made weaponry to fend off Russia and Trump immediately responding, â€œI would like you to do us a favor thoughâ€ â€” then suggesting Attorney General William Barr get in contact with Ukrainian officials.
On the surface it may seem odd that Ukraine, one of Europeâ€™s poorest countries, has become so central to the latest Trump drama. But the truth is that the country has been involved in Trump scandals since the very beginning.
â€œUkraine has certainly been a through line in a number of Trump investigations: the Republican National Committee platform, Russian ambitions, NATO commitments, and now this,â€ says Andy Wright, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration.
And that doesnâ€™t even touch on former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafortâ€™s lobbying work on behalf of a previous pro-Russian Ukrainian president or the wild conspiracies on the right that have led some (including, apparently, Trump himself) to believe Hillary Clintonâ€™s infamous email server is currently in Ukraine.
In other words, the Ukraine-Trump connection isnâ€™t new. Itâ€™s always been there. Weâ€™ve mostly just forgotten because so much has happened that itâ€™s hard to keep track of everything. So hereâ€™s a reminder of how Ukraine has played into the various Trump scandals from the very beginning.
Trump has sold out Ukraine to cozy up to Russia
One of the earliest controversies surrounding Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign centered on a disappearing section of the Republican Partyâ€™s 2016 platform.
Initially, the document had reportedly stated that the party â€” and thereby Trump, as the partyâ€™s official nominee â€” supported sending lethal aid to Ukraine. That would be an important signal for officials in Kyiv looking for help in their fight against Russia, which invaded the countryâ€™s east and south in 2014. Russia is a far more powerful country with more troops and equipment. US assistance, then, is essential to Ukraineâ€™s effort to defend itself against Russia.
But the final version of the GOP platform only said the US would provide â€œappropriate assistance to the armed forces of Ukraineâ€ in a Trump administration â€” a major softening of the language.
So what happened? Well, Trump campaign officials quietly worked behind the scenes to change the position, even hosting multiple events during the partyâ€™s convention in Cleveland to ensure the GOP wouldnâ€™t back shipping arms that Ukrainians could use against Russians.
Many Republican Party members were concerned by the change in language. â€œThis is another example of Trump being out of step with GOP leadership and the mainstream in a way that shows he would be dangerous for America and the world,â€ Rachel Hoff, a platform committee member, told the Washington Post at the time.
After entering the White House, Trump continued his warmth toward Russia. Among other things, Trump repeatedly bought Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s denials that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election; held meetings with Putin without notetakers, and sided with the Russian president over the US intelligence community during a summit in Helsinki last year.
Oddly, Trump ended up overturning the Obama administrationâ€™s ban on selling lethal weapons to Ukraine in 2017. That move allowed the US to sell the country anti-tank missiles and other advanced weapons that would help Ukraine better fight back against Russia, and it ingratiated the Trump administration with many in Ukraine.
Zelensky, who wants to end the war in the country, surely cares deeply about keeping military aid coming from the United States â€” a fact that Trump could use as leverage if he wanted to.
Paul Manafort, Trumpâ€™s former campaign chair, was a lobbyist for Ukraineâ€™s former pro-Russian president
It seems like forever ago, but itâ€™s worth remembering that the person in charge of Trumpâ€™s campaign for a while â€” Paul Manafort â€” had important relationships in Ukraine.
Before he joined Trumpâ€™s team, Manafort was already well known for his decades of Republican campaign and lobbying work. By around 2004, Manafort sought even grander paydays abroad by advising fantastically rich oligarchs in the former Soviet Union on how to master tumultuous democratic politics. He advised a Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, but eventually his efforts focused on Ukraine â€” where he landed a hefty contract to advise the countryâ€™s pro-Russian political party.
When Manafort got the gig, the Party of Regions and its leader Viktor Yanukovych were unpopular and in the opposition. But over the next few years, Manafort would help orchestrate the partyâ€™s return to power and Yanukovychâ€™s 2010 election as president.
Once Yanukovych was in office, Manafort became an enormously influential adviser to the regime â€” the Atlanticâ€™s Franklin Foer wrote last year that Manafort had â€œwalk-inâ€ privileges, and billed â€œoutrageous amountsâ€ to the Ukrainians while advising on both domestic politics and lobbying in the US.
But it all fell apart in 2014, when Ukrainians took to the streets to force Yanukovych out of power and he fled to Russia. Manafort and Deripaska, meanwhile, had a falling out that ended in a lawsuit, with Deripaska claiming Manafort cheated him of millions. Heâ€™d lost his biggest client and had serious cash flow problems, and the FBI looked into his Ukrainian money.

Manafortâ€™s work in Ukraine became a major focus of special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into alleged Trump-Russia ties. And what Muellerâ€™s team uncovered ended up landing Manafort in prison.
First, Manafort had moved $30 million of his Ukrainian lobbying money from foreign shell companies into the US â€” but he didnâ€™t disclose this income on his tax forms, pay taxes on it, or fill out legally required disclosures of his foreign accounts. Thatâ€™s illegal.
Second, Muellerâ€™s team focused on what Manafort did once he lost his Ukrainian income after the countryâ€™s president was deposed. They found he tried to conjure up more cash via bank fraud.
Manafort eventually pleaded guilty to a broad â€œconspiracy against the United Statesâ€ â€” in which he admitted unregistered lobbying and money laundering related to the Ukraine work. He received sentences of more than seven years combined in prison.
According to the Washington Post, part of the reason why Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has become so interested in getting close to the Ukrainian government is because he wants to punish those who put Manafort behind bars. It seems Giuliani will continue to deal with Ukranians in an effort to dig up dirt on anti-Trump Democrats and others the administration accuses of being the real colluders with Ukraine.
Trump seems to believe in a wacky conspiracy theory involve Ukraine and the DNCâ€™s server
On Trumpâ€™s now-infamous phone phone call with Zelensky, Trump cryptically asked Zelensky about a computer server in Ukraine and the American cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.
â€œI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike ... I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation,â€ he said.
It appears Trump was referring to a long-debunked conspiracy theory that the firm has covered up the fact that Ukraine â€” not Russia â€” interfered in the 2016 election.
Give your head a second to stop spinning, and then read on.
CrowdStrike was hired by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 to look into who hacked into their networks during the election. The firm determined that it was two Russian groups with Kremlin ties. Case closed, right? Not exactly.
Trump seems to believe â€” and has often mentioned â€” that a DNC server with the real information on it has gone missing, and that CrowdStrike (and the FBI) is somehow involved in its disappearance. He brought the issue up during his Helsinki meeting alongside Putin.
â€œYou have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server,â€ the president said during the July 2018 press conference. â€œWhere is the server? I want to know, where is the server and what is the server saying?â€

But hereâ€™s the problem: There is actually no missing physical server associated with the DNC breach to speak of. Instead, the roughly 140 servers â€” most of them cloud-based â€” are already out of use.
Whatâ€™s more, in a 2017 interview with the Associated Press, for example, Trump said CrowdStrike was â€œUkraine-basedâ€ â€” even though its headquarters are in California. â€œI heard itâ€™s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, thatâ€™s what I heard,â€ he continued.
Thatâ€™s incorrect. The companyâ€™s cofounder, the Russian-born US citizen Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, which receives funding from Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk. But that flimsy connection is a far cry from the firm he started being secretly run by an Eastern European billionaire.
(Disclosure: Before coming to Vox I worked at the Atlantic Council and interacted with Alperovitch on a few cybersecurity-related events and projects.)
CrowdStrike denies any wrongdoing in a statement to reporters: â€œWith regards to our investigation of the DNC hack in 2016, we provided all forensic evidence and analysis to the FBI. As weâ€™ve stated before, we stand by our findings and conclusions that have been fully supported by the US Intelligence community.â€
Itâ€™s still unclear just where Trump got this idea in his head, but itâ€™s ingrained enough that he mentioned it on a call with Ukraineâ€™s president.
So if you put the three elements together â€” Trumpâ€™s pro-Russia sentiments, Manafortâ€™s past work, and the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory â€” it becomes clear that the question isnâ€™t â€œWhy is Ukraine in the news?â€ The question really is: â€œWhy wasnâ€™t Ukraine in the news sooner?â€"
"Like Michael Cohen before him, Rudy Giuliani, though described as Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œpersonal attorney,â€ does not appear to provide legal services in the conventional sense.
He is, rather, a television surrogate and all-around factotum who carries out requests on the presidentâ€™s behalf while taking advantage of attorney-client privilege to put himself beyond the reach of subpoena power. And it appears he was the bagman for the Ukrainian caper thatâ€™s put Trump closer than ever to impeachment by the House of Representatives.
According to reporting by Greg Miller, Josh Dawsey, Paul Sonne, and Ellen Nakashima for the Washington Post, it was Giuliani who ran a â€œshadow Ukraine agenda.â€ The full scope of the agenda is still a matter of investigation, but it involves sidelining then-National Security Adviser John Bolton and other key officials to pressure the Ukrainian government into fabricating corruption charges against Joe Biden and his family.
Running sensitive diplomatic missions may sound like an odd job for an attorney not formally employed by the United States government. Adding that the attorney in question used to be mayor of New York City doesnâ€™t really explain it.
But the happenstance that put Giuliani close to the scene of Ground Zero in Manhattan on 9/11 earned him a totally unwarranted reputation as an authority on national security matters. Early in the Trump era, he was actively pursuing a role as US secretary of state. The fact that he was totally unqualified seems to have hurt his cause in that regard. As did, according to reporting at the time from Dawsey and Shane Goldmacher, a desire to avoid public scrutiny of his â€œpaid work for foreign governments.â€
But Giulianiâ€™s tendency to get mixed up in shady international dealings made him a perfect choice for the bagman role. And while nothing about his tenure as mayor suggests an abiding interest in Ukrainian security issues, during that period he did pioneer a style of politics that is recognizably Trumpy: featuring an extremely high ratio of spectacle and cultural grievance to interest in policy specifics, and a strand of authoritarianism that elevates law and order over the rule of law.
Rudyâ€™s rise to power
Giuliani became famous as President Ronald Reaganâ€™s appointee to serve as US attorney for the Southern District of New York. He prosecuted mob bosses and financial industry figures from the Wolf of Wall Street era and pioneered the use of the media-friendly â€œperp walkâ€ to gain attention for his exploits.
Even at the time, careful observers questioned whether his reputation was built more on real accomplishment or flimflam. William Glaberson reported for the New York Times that â€œfive months after Mr. Giuliani left the office, some of those who are best qualified to judge him say in interviews that not all of Mr. Giulianiâ€™s accomplishments were as impressive as his press clippings suggested and that his successes stemmed partly from extensive work by others and a healthy dose of luck.â€ Many of his biggest wins largely involved taking credit for the work of others (the Securities and Exchange Commission, the State Organized Crime Task Force), and some of his biggest prosecutions fell apart.
Nonetheless, he emerged from the 1980s as a well-known New York City Republican with a law-and-order reputation.
And in 1989, he got a big chance to run for mayor; the cityâ€™s incumbent white moderate Democrat Ed Koch was defeated in a primary by David Dinkins, a more liberal African American. Dinkins narrowly defeated Giuliani, but Rudy essentially kept on running for four years straight, fomenting a radicalized backlash against the cityâ€™s first black mayor.
A signature issue during that period was the new mayorâ€™s efforts to create a civilian complaint review board that would oversee allegations of misconduct against NYPD officers. As Nat and Nick Hentoff recounted in 2016, Giuliani helped lead a police riot against the proposed reforms:
As many as 10,000 demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Manhattan on Sept. 16, 1992. Reporters and innocent bystanders were violently assaulted by the mob as thousands of dollars in private property was destroyed in multiple acts of vandalism. The protesters stormed up the steps of City Hall, occupying the building. They then streamed onto the Brooklyn Bridge, where they blocked traffic in both directions, jumping on the cars of trapped, terrified motorists. Many of the protestors were carrying guns and openly drinking alcohol.
Yet the uniformed police present did little to stop them. Why? Because the rioters were nearly all white, off-duty NYPD officers. They were participating in a Patrolmenâ€™s Benevolent Association demonstration against Mayor David Dinkinsâ€™ call for a Civilian Complaint Review Board and his creation earlier that year of the Mollen Commission, formed to investigate widespread allegations of misconduct within the NYPD.
In the center of the mayhem, standing on top of a car while cursing Mayor Dinkins through a bullhorn, was mayoral candidate Rudy Giuliani.
â€Beer cans and broken beer bottles littered the streets as Mr. Giuliani led the crowd in chants,â€ The New York Times reported.
Witnesses, including New York Daily News columnist Jimmy Breslin, reported racial invective from the crowd, which challenged Breslin with questions like, â€œNow you got a ni**er right inside City Hall. How do you like that?â€
About a year later, New York had a new mayor: Rudy Giuliani.
Governing the ungovernable city
New York City today is safe for many and difficult to afford, with a politics overwhelmingly dominated by the reality that lots of people want to live there. Strong demand for living in New York generates political conflict around gentrification, rent prices, infrastructure capacity, school zoning details, NIMBYism, developers, and resentment of the rich.
But when I was a kid in New York in the 1980s, it was a city that was widely seen â€” like essentially all other Northeastern and Midwestern cities â€” as in decline.
Population had fitfully fallen since the rise of postwar suburban development, crime was high, and while the city certainly had its expensive neighborhoods it was not by any means particularly difficult to afford a place to live that had a reasonably convenient commute to somewhere.
The city was widely regarded as â€œungovernable,â€ paralyzed between intractable interest group demands and limited fiscal capacity. And while Giulianiâ€™s demagogic approach won him the election, it was a tenuous victory. Dinkins carried Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, while Giuliani dominated heavily white areas of Queens and depended for his margin of victory on a thumping performance in Staten Island â€” a place with a very suburban vibe that voted the very same day in favor of a referendum to secede from New York.
Just four years later, Giuliani won a landslide reelection and was widely regarded as a success story. Crime was down, property values were up, and shows like Friends and Seinfeld (along with many of the less-fondly remembered sitcoms from the Must-See TV block like Caroline in the City) portrayed New York as a desirable place for young people to live.
Looking back in retrospect at the miraculous New York City turnaround, whatâ€™s striking is how little there really was to it. It was David Gunnâ€™s six-year run as the head of the New York City Transit Authority from 1984 to 1990 that cured the subway of its graffiti problem and restored reliability to service. The cityâ€™s population, similarly, had already started growing again by 1990. And crime, Giulianiâ€™s signature issue, began to fall before he took office.
RobMagin1
Whatâ€™s more, we know now that murder rates started to fall in virtually all major American cities in the 1990s. In retrospect, some analysts credit the natural waning of the 1980s crack epidemic and the delayed benefits of the switch to unleaded gasoline. A Clinton administration initiative to fund hiring of more police officers also seems to have helped.
Itâ€™s true that New Yorkâ€™s crime drop was unusually large, so thereâ€™s a decent argument that NYC-specific innovations around police tactics â€” specifically using COMPSTAT computer data to keep better track of exactly where crimes were happening â€” played a role.
But broadly speaking, itâ€™s easy to tell a story in which Dinkins narrowly wins reelection in 1993 and then presides over four years of accelerating crime decline and leaves office term-limited, beloved, and well-positioned to challenge Al Dâ€™Amato in the 1998 New York Senate race. In this alternate reality, Giuliani becomes an obscure figure, Chuck Schumer rather than Hillary Clinton likely runs for Senate in 2000, and all the rest of American history plays out differently.
Instead, Giuliani won. And he aggressively sought â€” and received â€” the credit for the crime decline through relentless PR efforts but also constant championing of the police in even their darkest hours.
Giuliani time
Like Trump, Giuliani appeared to be deliberately courting accusations of racism as a way to position himself as the true champion of the cityâ€™s white majority.
In 1994 when veteran Rep. Charlie Rangel called on the mayor to do more outreach to black elected officials, Giuliani retorted that â€œtheyâ€™re going to have to learn how to discipline themselves in the way in which they speak also.â€ That in turn prompted a scolding from Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and helped entrench perceptions in liberal intellectual circles (like my parents and most of their friends) that Giuliani was a racist, and perceptions in working-class white circles that Giuliani was the victim of political correctness.
Early in his term, officers charged aggressively into a Harlem mosque based on a fake 9-1-1 call setting off a brawl that led to the injury of eight officers. Giuliani quickly positioned himself as the anti-Dinkins, insisting their was nothing wrong with the police officersâ€™ response, even though theyâ€™d clearly failed to follow departmental guidelines about dealing with places of worship, and insisted â€œthe only real issue was the assault on police officers.â€ Days later, the unarmed 17-year-old son of a prominent Brooklyn imam was shot after an arrest on drug possession charges and Giuliani again simply backed the protesters.
Later, in 1997, Abner Louima was physically and sexually assaulted by police officers who subsequently tried to cover up the attack.
Louima initially told the press that the officers, while assaulting him, had said â€œitâ€™s Giuliani timeâ€ â€” a claim that quickly became a focal point for liberal contentions that Giulianiâ€™s pro-cop identity politics was encouraging misconduct. As the case moved to trial, however, Louima withdrew the claim, thus turning the incident into more grist for the grievance mill as Giuliani said his critics owed him an apology.
The key policy dispute, however, continued to be about civilian oversight of the police department. To critics, the Louima case showed that police misconduct is a real problem that required a systematic policy solution; to Giuliani, it showed that the system worked, the police were in no need of oversight, and his critics were hysterical.
Crucially, the very existence of constant police-related controversies served to bolster the claim that something about Giuliani and his criminal justice policy was a very big deal. In retrospect, this seems false. Crime fell under the previous mayor and fell under Giulianiâ€™s two successors, and it fell in virtually every other major city as well, making it unlikely that anything special was happening at all.
But at the time, the New York situation felt very special because Giuliani was such a touchstone in the debate over police violence. The 1999 Agnostic Front hardcore song â€œPolice Stateâ€ contains the line â€œGiuliani, Giuliani, Giuliani, fuck you die.â€
After Amadou Diallo was shot 41 times by police officers who mistakenly thought he was reaching for a gun, the officers were acquitted of criminal charges. Bruce Springsteen wrote a song about it titled â€œAmerican Skin (41 Shots).â€ That earned him condemnation from Giuliani, who complained, â€œThere are still people trying to create the impression that the police officers are guilty.â€
The ultimate case of law and order versus the rule of law, however, came after the shooting of 26-year-old Patrick Dorismond, who was shot in a scuffle with undercover police officers who appeared to be attempting to get him to sell them drugs (he was not a drug dealer). Giuliani responded to the shooting by releasing elements of Dorismondâ€™s sealed juvenile record.
This had no relevance to the incident since it had happened nearly 10 years in the past, but Giuliani explained to Fox News Sunday: â€œPeople do act in conformity very often with their prior behaviorâ€ and he â€œwould not want a picture presented of an altar boy, when in fact, maybe it isnâ€™t an altar boy, itâ€™s some other situation that may justify, more closely, what the police officer did.â€™â€™
Dorismond, it turns out, had literally been an altar boy in Catholic school.
9/11 made him Americaâ€™s mayor
Giuliani flirted heavily with running for Senate in 2000 but backed down amid some messy personal issues and the realization that he would likely lose.
With his term expiring in 2001 and an incumbent Republican governor set to run for reelection in 2002, Giuliani had no obvious path forward in national politics. Whatâ€™s more, while he wasnâ€™t exactly unpopular by the end of his term, itâ€™s fair to say that the city was experiencing a fair amount of Rudy fatigue. Mark Green, a Manhattan liberal of the sort Giuliani had long defined himself against, was ahead in the polls and seemed likely to defeat Michael Bloomberg, who himself had stayed fairly aloof from Giuliani.
Giuliani had at this time been making headlines by picking weird fights about art with the Brooklyn Museum and seemed to have largely exhausted his policy agenda. People wanted some effort at mending fences between police and the black community, but Giuliani wasnâ€™t going to touch that topic. And he seemed to have relatively little interest in education, transportation, and the other main elements of municipal government.
Then came the September 11 terrorist attacks, a confusing and frightening time for virtually everyone and a perfect backdrop for Giulianiâ€™s showmanship. Giuliani did not particularly do anything noteworthy on the day in question, and in retrospect his administrationâ€™s earlier decision to house the cityâ€™s emergency command center at 7 World Trade Center (which was destroyed in the attack) was a tragic error. But he offered a kind of commanding on-the-ground presence and his leadership was reassuring to many moderate New Yorkers whoâ€™d voted for him but never in a million years would have backed George W. Bush for president.
Frightening, traumatic events tend to boost authoritarian aspects of peopleâ€™s political psychology so the prevailing climate of that autumn gave a huge boost to Giulianiâ€™s public standing. Giuliani himself attempted to leverage that boost into getting the state legislature to cancel the upcoming election and extend his term, which they did not do. But his surging popularity and strident public endorsement did help put Bloomberg over the top, contrary to the summer polling trends.
It also earned him a slightly baffling selection as Timeâ€™s Person of the Year and launched his second act in American politics.
Rudy Giuliani, anti-terrorism superstar
As the mayor of a heavily Democratic city, Giuliani had never been much of an orthodox Republican on policy.
He branded himself as solidly pro-choice, embraced LGBT rights at a time when Republican senators were refusing to confirm an openly gay ambassador, and was a pioneer of the â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ concept fighting to defend New Yorkâ€™s undocumented residents against Clinton-era immigration crackdowns (notably at the time, New Yorkâ€™s Latinx population was predominantly non-immigrant Puerto Ricans and its undocumented population was tilted toward Eastern Europeans whites).
Whatâ€™s more, back in 1994 Giuliani had endorsed Democrat Mario Cuomoâ€™s reelection bid on the grounds that the Democratâ€™s budget ideas were better for the city than those of his GOP opponent. That could have ended up being a very savvy political move, except Cuomo lost the race and Giuliani landed awkwardly on the shit list of a new Republican governor.
But his performance on 9/11 and the weird anti-terrorism politics of the Bush years turned Giuliani briefly into a mainstream conservative icon. He delivered one of the featured speeches at the 2004 Republican National Convention and it was entirely about foreign policy and national security issues, with nothing to say about any topic a mayor would actually deal with or know anything about. He launched a consulting business with his last pick for NYPD commissioner, Bernard Kerik, and tried to push Bush to appoint Kerik as Secretary of Homeland Security, an effort that was later derailed by revelations that Kerik had broken all kinds of laws. Even so, Giuliani entered the 2008 GOP primary and jumped out to a big early lead in the polls before collapsing under scrutiny.
Much of this was policy scrutiny â€” Giuliani was unacceptable to the Religious Right â€” but it also turned out that as mayor heâ€™d billed city agencies tens of thousands of dollars to take trips to the Hamptons to carry on an affair with Judith Nathan. There were also many questions about his murky lobbying ties to foreign clients, including some deemed national security threats by the Bush administration. After the disastrous collapse of his presidential campaign, Giuliani seemed set to slip into obscurity (he was retirement age anyway) but then along came Trump.

Trumpâ€™s loyal foot soldier
Itâ€™s easy to forget now, but back in the fall of 2016 not only was Trump widely forecast to lose the election, heâ€™d been semi-disavowed by much of his party.
House Speaker Paul Ryan had formally stated that he would no longer campaign with or defend Trump, upward of a dozen GOP senators pointedly refused to endorse him against Hillary Clinton, and Ted Cruz delivered a memorable GOP convention speech in which he exhorted the crowd to â€œvote your conscience.â€
This created an extremely valuable role for Giuliani in the Trump campaign. For starters, Rudy was a well-known public figure and a real Republican Party politician who had held elective office and been a featured speaker at GOP conventions. The specific details of the cloud of corruption and scandal under which heâ€™d slinked away from public life had largely been forgotten, and while movement conservatives had been very alarmed by the idea of Giuliani as president they were happy to see him as a surrogate.
Whatâ€™s more, unlike most GOP politicians, Trump was personally comfortable with Giuliani.
A notable feature of the Trump administration has been that Trump himself sometimes seems to get along better on an interpersonal level with big-city Democrats â€” at least older white ones like Schumer and Nancy Pelosi â€” than he does with churchy rural Republicans. Giuliani, like Trump, is in the very small Venn diagram of big-city Republicans so they had a strong personal rapport.
Giuliani also more or less shares Trumpâ€™s distinctive shamelessness. He once got in a screaming fight about ferrets while hosting a call-in radio show. And Giuliani, like Trump, doesnâ€™t seem to really care about public policy as itâ€™s conventionally understood. Michael Bloomberg had a controversial education policy agenda and Bill de Blasio has a different controversial education policy agenda. Bloomberg also revamped aspects of New Yorkâ€™s transportation and de Blasio has made fitful efforts to change housing policy. It would be an overstatement to say that Giuliani didnâ€™t do anything on these subjects, but he didnâ€™t engage with them.
The only signature Giuliani policy was opposing civilian oversight of the NYPD. But even there the point was less any specific policy content than a kind of culture war about the police. He liked to fight with people who complained about police brutality more than he liked to delve into the details of crime control policy.
When it was politically important for him to be pro-choice and pro-LGBT he was; then he seemed surprised that the religious right had a problem with those positions. Now that heâ€™s on Team Trump he doesnâ€™t care about them at all â€” nor does he seem to remember that he used be a strident critic of strict immigration enforcement. During his flirtation with being a foreign policy expert, Giuliani was a pretty hard-core neoconservative hawk, something he also gave up to join the Trump Train.
Rather than having policy views in common with Trump, the two men share a common lack of real interest in policy views. They have, instead, strong views about who should be in charge (men with guns and badges acting in alliance with sympathetic businessmen) and who should shut up (everyone who has a problem with that).
And for all their law-and-order posturing, they share a distinct record of total contempt for actual laws and legal procedures. The point of law-and-order politics isnâ€™t that you donâ€™t stage a riot or leak a sealed juvenile record or make sure your police commissioner isnâ€™t corrupt â€” itâ€™s to make sure the law-and-order people stay in charge.
While Giulianiâ€™s mission to Ukraine may not have been ethical, in accordance with the law, or reflective of how American foreign policy is supposed to operate it was absolutely in pursuit of keeping the law-and-order people in charge of the government.
That, for Rudy, has always been good enough."
"Wednesday morning the White House released an edited summary of President Donald Trumpâ€™s call with Ukraineâ€™s President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25, the call that appears to have inspired the now-famous whistleblower complaint against Trump. The document, which reads like a transcript, was widely expected to cast the presidentâ€™s behavior in a more flattering light.
It did not. If anything, itâ€™s more evidence for the worst-case scenario: That President Trump was conditioning military aid to Ukraine on the countryâ€™s willingness to investigate his domestic political enemies.
The House Judiciary Committee members were given copies of the transcript of President Trumpâ€™s call with President Volodymr Zelensky on September 25, 2019. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
In the summary, Zelensky asks Trump for an increase in military aid â€” specifically, to purchase more Javelin anti-tank missiles, useful in Ukraineâ€™s ongoing conflict with Russian-backed separatists in its east.
Trump responds by saying, â€œI would like you to do us a favor though.â€
The favor turns out to be about two investigations Trump would like Ukraine to conduct: one about a bizarre and unfounded theory about Ukrainian possession of a Democratic email server, the other about the Biden familyâ€™s allegedly corrupt dealings with a Ukrainian prosecutor.
We previously knew that the president had asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens because both the president and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, admitted it. We now know that he also asked Ukraine to investigate the Democratic Party and that he connected it to the question of military aid in their conversation.

Thatâ€™s not the entirety of whatâ€™s bad for Trump in the transcript â€” thereâ€™s concerning stuff about Attorney General William Barr as well. But the top-line takeaway is that the White Houseâ€™s summary is anything but exculpatory.

The biggest takeaway from the summary: it sure looks like a quid pro quo
Itâ€™s important to note, at the outset, that this call summary is not quite a verbatim transcript of what Trump and Zelensky said. Itâ€™s written like a transcript, with direct quotations assigned to each leader, but it is not an authoritative transcription of an audio recording â€” as a note on the first page makes clear.
â€œThe text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place,â€ it explains. â€œA number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in accent and/or interpretation.â€
So there are likely some errors and omissions, and there is at least one pretty notable unclarity in the document Iâ€™ll point out later on. But itâ€™s worth treating the parts that are written down as, for now, roughly accurate quotations of both Trump and Zelensky.

The context for the call is important too. According to a Washington Post report, a week before phoning Zelensky, who had just assumed office, Trump ordered chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to suspend $400 million worth of US military aid to Ukraine (the aid was unlocked in September). So you have a new leader of a country locked in conflict with much more powerful Russia speaking to one of its principal international benefactors, which has recently suspended military aid.
After a few pleasantries early in the call, Trump brings up this military aid unprompted. He goes out of his way to compare US assistance to EU aid to Ukraine. â€œI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time,â€ he tells Zelensky. â€œMuch more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are.â€
Zelensky agrees, telling Trump â€œthe United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and Iâ€™m very grateful to you for that.â€ This is true, at least when it comes to military aid â€” which means Trump really does have leverage here.
The Ukrainian leader then makes a request for the US to increase its military assistance, specifically by selling his country more Javelin anti-tank missiles. This is the pivot point in the summary, so Iâ€™m going to quote it in context:
ZELENSKY: I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We. are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps. Specifically, we are almost. ready to buy more Javelins from the UnitedÂ· States for defense purposes.
TRUMP: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike ... I guess you have one of your weal thy people. ... The server, they say Ukraine has it.
The word â€œthoughâ€ in Trumpâ€™s line makes it clear whatâ€™s going on here, explicitly connecting the request for aid to Trumpâ€™s request for â€œa favorâ€ after Trump initiated a conversation about how important US aid is for Ukraine. And that favor is investigating â€œthe server.â€

Now, you might be tempted to think that Trump is asking about Hillary Clintonâ€™s email server. But Trump references CrowdStrike, a California-based cybersecurity firm, which suggests heâ€™s talking about something different. CrowdStrike was the company that linked Russia to the hack of the Democratic National Committee back in 2016. Trump seems to be floating a conspiracy theory, promulgated by his attorney Rudy Giuliani, that it was actually Ukraine that hacked the Democrats â€” and then tried to frame Trump and Russia for it.
This contravenes every piece of evidence we have on the DNC hack, including the unanimous assessment of US intelligence agencies that Russia was responsible for it and an indictment from Muellerâ€™s team spelling out exactly how it happened. Trump also seems fundamentally confused about how hacking works: the hackers got access to DNC emails, but did not take the server itself.
But Trump seems to be asking Zelensky to investigate the DNC emails anyway, presumably because it would make him look good politically and allow him to suggest the Democrats were part of a conspiracy thatâ€™s out to get him.
Thatâ€™s not the full extent of Trumpâ€™s â€œfavor.â€ He also asks Zelensky to look into Hunter Bidenâ€™s business dealings with a Ukrainian company, as well as totally unsubstantiated allegations that Joe Biden was corruptly working to shield his son from prosecution:
The other thing, thereâ€™s a lot of talk about Bidenâ€™s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.

The situation stems from Hunter Bidenâ€™s work with Burisma Holdings, a company owned by a controversial and possibly corrupt Ukrainian oligarch. The allegation is that Joe Biden attempted to get the Ukrainian prosecutor general fired in order to protect Burisma and his son from investigation. There is, however, no reason to believe this. Joe Biden did attempt to get the prosecutor general fired, but that was the result of the prosecutorâ€™s own involvement in corruption; there is no evidence he was investigating Burisma at the time. Hunter Bidenâ€™s dealings with Burisma were arguably unethical, but there is no reason to believe that they were illegal or that his father did anything wrong.
We already knew that Trump had requested Zelensky to investigate this phantom Biden conspiracy. But in context of the transcript, his use of the phrase â€œthe other thingâ€ makes it part of the same â€œfavorâ€ as investigating the server hack. Itâ€™s all part of the same request, the one that Trump has seemed to link to US military assistance to Ukraine â€” which he had conveniently suspended just one week prior to the call.
Taken in context, what we have here most clearly reads as a quid pro quo, with Trump offering policy favors if Zelensky helps him politically.
Leading up to the readoutâ€™s release, the situation looked bad for Trump, with the president openly admitting prior to its publication that he tried to get a foreign leader to investigate one of his leading political opponents, potentially compromising the integrity of the 2020 election. Now it seems like he wasnâ€™t just requesting Zelensky investigate Biden; it looks like he was unsubtly trying to strong-arm him into doing it by leveraging US military assistance.
Another big reason this call is a bad look â€” and how it could get worse
While the evidence of the quid pro quo is the main takeaway from the call summary, itâ€™s hardly the only troubling part of the document.
Near the end, when discussing the situation involving Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor, Trump tells Zelensky to expect calls both from Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and US Attorney General William Barr:
I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get toÂ· the bottom of it. Iâ€™m sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything.
The Giuliani part is corrupt but no surprise: Weâ€™ve known that Giuliani was running a kind of shadow Ukraine policy aimed at securing Ukrainian assistance in Trumpâ€™s reelection bid. The really eye-popping element here is the reference to Attorney General Barr.
The attorney general is supposed to be the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, accountable to the president but not his personal lawyer. They are at once a member of the administration and a check on it.

Barr has proven himself to have difficulty with this dual role â€” most notably, when he repeatedly attempted to spin the Mueller reportâ€™s findings in the presidentâ€™s favor before its release, misleading the American public about its findings. This phone call suggests that Barr may also be involved in Trumpâ€™s scheme for abusing his powers of office for political gain. If so, that would be a major new scandal in its own right.
The callâ€™s references to Barr are relatively brief; we donâ€™t actually know the extent of his involvement in this situation. But there are already calls for Barr to recuse himself from any involvement in investigating Trumpâ€™s conduct, and Democrats are all but certain to investigate the full extent of Barrâ€™s role in all of this.
This isnâ€™t the only tantalizingly unclear point in the White House summary. Remember, this is an edited account and not a verbatim transcription â€” which means itâ€™s possible the White House omitted some passages that are even more devastating to the president.
For example, look at one of the crucial lines from the section about Biden: â€œBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ... It sounds horrible to me.â€ Those ellipses are the White Houseâ€™s, not mine. Itâ€™s possible they denote a pause; itâ€™s equally possible they denote that Trump said something in between those two sentences that the White House would rather not reveal.
The point, then, is that weâ€™re only at the beginning stages of understanding what was happening here. If the evidence is already this bad, itâ€™s possible it could get worse. With Democrats pursuing an impeachment inquiry over Ukraine that spans six different House committees, each with subpoena power, more facts could well come out.
But the biggest takeaway here is that in some ways, we donâ€™t really need more facts. We already know that the presidentâ€™s behavior, in this case, is deeply inappropriate and corrupt.

We know that the president asked for investigations into his political opponents and politically helpful conspiracy theories, essentially calling for a foreign power to interfere with the conduct of the 2020 election. We know that there he at least strongly implied that he would be conditioning an important policy decision on Ukraineâ€™s compliance here, suggesting that heâ€™s willing to abuse his powers of office for political advantage.
Iâ€™ve said it before, and Iâ€™ll say it again: If this isnâ€™t impeachable, I donâ€™t know what is.

"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has officially announced that the House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, and the release of a readout of a call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asks Zelensky to revive a criminal inquiry into Joe Bidenâ€™s son Hunter, has not quelled Democratsâ€™ desire to impeach.
Itâ€™s quite difficult to impeach, convict, and remove a president from office â€” so much so thatâ€™s itâ€™s never happened in US history. (Two presidents have been impeached but acquitted; another resigned to avoid near-certain impeachment.)

But if youâ€™re interested in understanding how impeachment works â€” if, for example, you are a White House lawyer â€” thereâ€™s one important thing to know. While it looks and feels a whole lot like a legal or judicial process, in practice impeachment is dominated by politics from start to finish.
Now, if a sitting president of the United States stood in the middle of Fifth Avenue, shot a random person in broad daylight, and was caught with a smoking gun, itâ€™s probably a safe bet that Congress would vote to impeach him, convict him, and remove him from office, despite their partisanship. (Probably.)
But most political scandals are not so indisputable, damning, or well-documented as that. And on any matter where there is some sort of plausible deniability for the president, his political allies will have very strong incentive to give him the benefit of the doubt, even if it means twisting themselves into knots. So even though Democrats have retaken the House, theyâ€™d still need to come up with a case strong enough to convince two-thirds of the Senate to actually convict him â€” a tall order.
What is impeachment?
The term â€œimpeachmentâ€ itself dates back centuries in England, where it was â€œa device for prosecuting great lords and high officials who were beyond the reach of the law courts,â€ as David Stewart writes in Impeached, a book about President Andrew Johnsonâ€™s trial.
But in the US context, the framers of the Constitution set up the impeachment process to be a way Congress can remove the president from power.
First, the House of Representatives has the power to impeach the president. A simple majority is necessary for an article of impeachment to be approved (each article lays out a charge against the president).
Then the process moves to the Senate, where a trial will be held, with the chief justice of the Supreme Court presiding.
Finally, and crucially, it takes a two-thirds vote from the Senate to actually convict a president on any count. Conviction on any count would then remove the president from office and put the vice president in power.
Note that two-thirds of the Senate â€” 67 votes â€” is a very high threshold thatâ€™s almost never achieved on any matter thatâ€™s remotely partisan. The framers did not make it easy for Congress to remove a democratically elected president from power.
What can the president actually be impeached for?
The Constitution specifies two specific crimes â€” treason and bribery â€” that could merit impeachment and removal from office. In addition to that, it mentions a vaguer, broader category of â€œother high Crimes and Misdemeanors.â€
Thatâ€™s all we get, and what, exactly, that last category entails has been the subject of a great deal of debate through US history. When Gerald Ford was House minority leader, he said, â€œAn impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.â€ But he said this when he was trying to impeach a Supreme Court justice, not a president.
Now, as a practical matter, Ford is absolutely right. If a majority of the House of Representatives wants to vote to impeach the president, it doesn't seem that anyone can stop it from doing so. The Constitution says it has â€œthe sole Power of Impeachment.â€ Unlike ordinary trials, evidentiary standards and even the charges themselves donâ€™t necessary have to be grounded in law; itâ€™s all up to Congress to decide what matters.
Still, impeachment efforts that are wholly grounded in politics without even a thin pretext of an actual crime havenâ€™t gotten very far, historically. In practice, some allegation of criminal behavior from the president has been necessary for the impeachment process to get moving â€” even if the true motivation for most of the primary actors really is political.
How often has impeachment happened in history?
The only two American presidents ever to have been impeached were Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998-â€™99. Neither was actually convicted and removed from office. However, Richard Nixon was headed toward seemingly certain impeachment and likely conviction in 1974, and preemptively resigned his office. No other president has come particularly close to being impeached.
1) Andrew Johnson: Johnson had been elevated to the presidency after Abraham Lincolnâ€™s assassination, and his policy preferences about the postâ€“Civil War South proved to be dramatically at odds with those of the Republicans who controlled Congress. (Essentially, Johnson was far more sympathetic to the interests of Southern whites, and wanted to restore them to power quickly in formerly Confederate states rather than pursue more extensive reforms.)

This years-long policy and political conflict was the true motivation for Johnsonâ€™s impeachment. The House of Representatives first considered whether to impeach Johnson in 1867, but voted against it â€” there was no consensus on what particular high crimes Johnson had committed.
Soon, though, they found their pretext. That same year, Congress overrode Johnsonâ€™s veto to pass a constitutionally dubious law called the Tenure in Office Act, which declared that the president could not fire his Cabinet officials without Senate approval. This was done to try to keep Johnsonâ€™s war secretary, Edwin Stanton, a staunch Republican ally whom Lincoln had appointed, in place to carry out Reconstruction policy. Still, Johnson fired Stanton anyway. The House responded by quickly impeaching the president, but he ended up being acquitted in the Senate by a single vote.
2) Richard Nixon: More than a century passed before the impeachment of a president was next seriously considered â€” in 1973, after revelations that President Nixonâ€™s aides appeared to be complicit in the break-in at the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Hotel and the cover-up that ensued.
As Dylan Matthews wrote in his comprehensive explainer, â€œIt's not really the break-in itself that ended Nixon's presidency so much as the fact that the ensuing investigation revealed a tangled web of wrongdoing of almost unfathomable scale and complexity, implicating the highest levels of the White House, up to and including the president.â€

Revelations of break-ins, efforts to smear political opponents or critics, cover-ups, attempts to suppress investigations, and hush money payments all came to light, leading to trials and convictions of several top Nixon aides. And crucially, the president taped himself discussing or approving many of these matters, and those tapes came to light â€” providing evidence that was tremendously difficult to dispute. By summer 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon (obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress), and he resigned to preempt what seemed a near-certain impeachment.
3) Bill Clinton: Independent counsel Ken Starr had been operating a years-long investigation into various sprawling matters involving President Bill Clinton and his associates, and ended up filing a report alleging that Clinton had lied under oath and obstructed justice to prevent his affair with Monica Lewinsky from becoming known.

The House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, but the Senate acquitted him relatively easily â€” the president was popular, the impeachment effort was viewed as partisan, and enough senators concluded the crimes werenâ€™t serious enough to warrant the presidentâ€™s removal from office. The two-thirds Senate threshold for conviction remained far out of reach.
How does impeachment actually play out in the House?
Impeachment happens in the House of Representatives, and since the House is run on majority rules, itâ€™s really up the majority party to run the process as it sees fit.
In our two 20th-century examples, Presidents Nixon and Clinton, the full House first voted to refer the matter to the House Judiciary Committee, which would draft impeachment articles and vote on whether to send them to the House floor.
In Nixonâ€™s case, the House Judiciary Committee conducted its own investigation into Watergate and other scandals â€” holding hearings, hearing witness testimony, and so forth. Eventually, it approved three articles of impeachment, sending them to the House floor â€” but before the House could vote on them, Nixon resigned.
For Clinton, the Judiciary Committee decided not to conduct its own investigation, but rather to just vote on allegations drawn from the Starr report. The committee drafted four impeachment articles, and voted to approve them all.

Action over that next week in December 1998 then shifted to the floor of the House of Representatives. The full House voted on all four articles, with only a majority needed for approval of each. Two (a perjury count and an â€œabuse of officeâ€ count) were voted down, but the other two (one perjury count and one obstruction of justice count) were approved, though with overwhelmingly Republican votes and just a handful of Democrats. This meant Clinton was impeached, and that the Senate would have to hold a trial to determine whether to remove him from office.
Our older historical example, the 1868 impeachment of President Johnson, unfolded somewhat differently. When Johnson defied the Tenure of Office Act by dismissing his secretary of war without Senate approval, a special House committee on Reconstruction controlled by Johnsonâ€™s fiercest critics quickly voted to recommend impeachment. The full House of Representatives then voted overwhelmingly to impeach Johnson two days later â€” even though they didnâ€™t have any specific charges drawn up yet.
A special House impeachment committee was created to actually draft those charges. Eventually, the full House voted to approve 11 specific articles of impeachment â€” most of which involved the Tenure of Office Act â€” though one focused on mean speeches the president gave disparaging Congress (seriously).

How does an impeachment trial play out in the Senate?
Though the actual action of impeachment in the House looks a lot like votes on any ordinary bill or resolution, the Senate is where things start to look quite different â€” because the Senate is hosting a trial, something it very rarely does.
In this trial, the House of Representatives acts as a prosecutor â€” designating certain impeachment managers to argue their side in the Senate. The presidentâ€™s lawyers are the defense team â€” the president does not have to appear in person and historically has not. The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides and is responsible for making procedural rulings during the trial â€” however, the Senate can vote to overrule his decisions.
In addition to effectively being the jury that votes to acquit or convict at the end, senators get to decide how the trial is conducted. For Clintonâ€™s trial, the Senate decided on a target end date, whether to allow House prosecutors to depose witnesses (the House wanted to depose 15, the Senate let them depose three), and whether to hear live witness testimony (they chose not to). Senators can make these decisions either through unanimous consent or by voting on a proposal put forth by Senate leadership.
Now, Johnsonâ€™s impeachment trial in 1868 looked a whole lot like a real trial. Witnesses were called, sworn testimony was given, and evidence was presented. The outcome truly was in the balance. At the end, senators had to vote on whether to convict or acquit on particular articles. A two-thirds vote on any one article would have convicted Johnson and remove him from office. However, in the three articles the Senate voted on, Republicans fell short of this margin by just a single vote all three times â€” so he was acquitted, and remained in office.

By contrast, Clintonâ€™s impeachment trial in 1999 was a bit of a joke. It was clear to everyone in advance that Republicans werenâ€™t even close to the two-thirds of senators they needed to convict Clinton, since the president was popular and the impeachment effort was viewed as partisan. As Jeffrey Toobin recounts in his book The Nine:
The Senate heard from no live witnesses, and the â€œtrialâ€ consisted almost entirely of statements by the House â€œmanagersâ€ â€” the members of the Judiciary Committee who served as prosecutors â€” and Clintonâ€™s defense lawyers. ... The dreary proceedings lasted five weeks. ... The outcome had never been in doubt.
During the trial, Toobin continues, Chief Justice William Rehnquist â€œmade only a single substantive rulingâ€ â€” he ruled that the House prosecutors shouldnâ€™t keep referring to the senators as â€œjurors.â€ (Rehnquist later said, â€œI did nothing in particular, and I did it very well.â€) In the end, Clinton was acquitted 55-45 on one count and 50-50 on the other, with Republicans not even coming close to the 67 votes they needed to remove him from office.
What does this mean for Trump?
Crucially, Johnson, Nixon, and Clinton â€” the presidents who were either impeached or who, in Nixonâ€™s case, resigned to preempt a coming impeachment â€” all faced Congresses in which both chambers were controlled by their political enemies, and who therefore wanted them out of power.
Trump, of course, does not. And so long as Republicans control the Senate, itâ€™s difficult to imagine any removal of Trump. The president is still quite popular among GOP voters, and party interests still need him to appoint conservative judges and sign conservative bills. So Republicans in Congress have a strong incentive to give him the benefit of the doubt on any scandal or controversy in which he has some sort of plausible deniability (and perhaps even some in which he may not).
Donald Trump, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, attends the UN Climate Action Summit at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on September 23, 2019.
Furthermore, though many Republican elites would probably privately prefer having Mike Pence as president, Trump retains significant support among GOP voters and the partyâ€™s base. So actually ousting him would mean tearing the party apart. Thatâ€™s likely why, to this point, most of the congressional GOP has seemed happy to look the other way on Trumpâ€™s scandals or ethical problems.
And even changes in the political situation â€” say, Trump losing some of his base â€” wouldnâ€™t necessarily be enough to surmount that challenging two-thirds barrier in the Senate.
The only thing that can really shake up this calculus is new information. If much more extremely damning evidence of some very serious presidential crime emerges, and proves sufficient to turn a significant chunk of the presidentâ€™s party against him, that is when impeachment and conviction becomes a real possibility. But if the topic remains partisan, nothing will come of it.

A decade ago, Washington, DC, was on the cusp of gaining real representation in Congress. DC dwellers â€” who outnumber the populations of both Wyoming and Vermont â€” had been able to cast their votes in presidential elections since 1964, but they still lacked any voting power at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. (Washington has one congressional representative, currently Eleanor Holmes Norton, who can serve on committees but is not permitted to vote.)
The proposal back then was this: DCâ€™s non-voting delegate would be replaced by a full-fledged House member. In exchange, an additional seat would be created, which initially would have gone to a safely Republican part of Utah, balancing DCâ€™s heavily Democratic voter base. In many ways, the deal was a Band-Aid for the problem residents actually want fixed. DC doesnâ€™t have a vote in Congress because it isnâ€™t a state, and becoming one is a long political ordeal: The last states joined the union 60 years ago, if that gives you an idea of how impossible adding another one seems now.

Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via Getty Images
The 2009 deal, which would have circumvented the statehood process, made it through the Senate but died in the House. Democrats objected to provisions attached to the Senate bill to gut DCâ€™s gun-control laws. But Republicans werenâ€™t too happy either â€” including Jason Chaffetz, then still a representative from Utah. He didnâ€™t like the trade-off, even though it meant more power for his state. â€œThis whole thing strikes me as political bribery,â€ Chaffetz complained. â€œIf Washington, DC, is due representation, make that case. â€¦ Donâ€™t try and dangle a carrot out there.â€
Now, Washington, DC, is trying again to press its case: Last week, Congress held its first hearing on DC statehood in more than 25 years. But Chaffetz wasnâ€™t wrong about the state of affairs.
Political bribery is what the creation of states has been all about, with some exceptions. Whenever thereâ€™s a desire to create a new state, all Congress has to do is vote for it. But like animals on Noahâ€™s ark, states have historically entered the union in pairs, with lawmakers using new states to maintain the balance of partisan power â€” or at least try to.
â€œIt was never written down, but itâ€™s not an accident you got states in pairs,â€ says Louisiana State University historian Jonathan Earle.
A majority of representatives are already co-sponsors of the bill that would make DC a state. Back in March, the chamber passed a resolution that endorsed statehood. Still, the reality is that statehood for DC â€” or Puerto Rico, for that matter â€” doesnâ€™t stand a chance.
Even if the House passes a statehood bill, it faces certain death in the Senate, where the Republican majority is adamantly opposed to adding a state where only 4 percent of voters supported Donald Trump in 2016. Democrats view DC statehood as a way to rebalance a Senate and Electoral College that have stymied progressive priorities, and Republicans oppose the idea for that very reason. And public opinion is on their side. More than 60 percent of Americans oppose statehood for DC, according to a recent Gallup poll.
A similar share support statehood for Puerto Rico, according to the same poll. But history has shown that the creation of new states generally involves some form of power-sharing agreement. Right now, the GOP has no incentive to bless the creation of new states that Democrats would surely dominate. â€œDC and Puerto Rico are both likely to be Democratic states,â€ says Robert Pierce Forbes, a historian at Southern Connecticut State University. â€œItâ€™s hard to see what you trade to get even one of them in.â€
Insisting on tit for tat is part of a long pattern in American politics. The most recent additions to the US, Alaska and Hawaii, were brought in almost simultaneously in 1959 because one was understood to be Democratic and the other Republican.
Admitting states in ways that preserve partisan balance may sound cynical. The habit grew out of something much uglier. Throughout the first half of the 19th century, Southerners repeatedly blocked attempts to admit Northern free states unless they got a new slave state in return.
The birth of a state has frequently involved wrenching compromise, with the debate turning directly on the question of extending slavery or battles over race. The preservation of power has always been central to the equation.
Making new states wasnâ€™t supposed to be complicated
The Constitution was written to make it easy to achieve Americaâ€™s deeply rooted ambition to expand. But shortly after the founding, statehood fights devolved into a struggle involving the nationâ€™s original sin of slavery.
Whatâ€™s known as the new states clause (Article IV, Section III of the Constitution) gives Congress the power to create states with few restrictions. Delegates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 rejected the idea of imposing a voting requirement beyond the simple majority typically required to pass the House and Senate. Whenever thereâ€™s political will to create a state, Congress has free rein to do so.
Typically, Congress first passes an enabling act to allow residents to form a territorial government and propose a constitution. It later passes a law or resolution to admit a territory as a state â€” nearly always imposing conditions that have involved everything from voting rights, the stateâ€™s political rules, language requirements, and, in the case of Utah, a ban on polygamy.
This system worked for the first few decades of the new United States â€” for settlers, if not the Native Americans they forced out nor enslaved people across the country. Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi were all admitted shortly after the War of 1812, which, â€œby removing the threat of the woodland Indians and the Creeks in the South, accelerated both the white settlement of these areas and the alacrity with which Congress acted to incorporate them as states,â€ writes historian Sean Wilentz.
The nation expanded rapidly, thanks to passage of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 (which covered much of what we now call the Upper Midwest) and the Louisiana Purchase. That favorable 1803 deal with France brought in land that stretched from the Mississippi River to the Rockies, more than doubling the size of the country. â€œIf you had a bona fide amount of settlers, you could apply to Congress,â€ says Earle. â€œIt worked without a hitch until Missouri applied for statehood in 1819.â€

In 1819, the Senate was evenly divided between North and South, with senators from the 11 states that allowed slavery and an equal number from the 11 free states. Missouri threatened to extend slavery west of the Mississippi River. The following year, House Speaker Henry Clay crafted the Missouri Compromise.
Missouri would enter the union as a slave state, but its admission was coupled with that of the free state of Maine, which until then had been part of Massachusetts. In addition, slavery was banned from any new states north of 36Â°30â€™ latitude, a line stretching out from Missouriâ€™s border with the South.
â€œWhen that was proposed, it was considered shockingly transactional,â€ says Forbes, author of The Missouri Compromise and Its Aftermath: Slavery and the Meaning of America. â€œThere was a huge backlash in Maine. There was a famous comment by one legislator that his constituents would rather wait a thousand years for statehood than to take it on condition of bringing in a slave state.â€
Southerners werenâ€™t happy about the arrangement, either. Until that time, they had successfully blocked any attempt by Congress to regulate slavery in the states. They recognized that any limits meant its potential abolition. An elderly Thomas Jefferson saw that a â€œgeographic line, coinciding with a marked principleâ€ would forever be a source of irritation. â€œThis momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror,â€ Jefferson wrote. â€œI considered it at once as the knell of the Union.â€
Statehood was a central front in the battle over slavery
If the idea of coupling free states with slave states was initially shocking, it soon became the norm. Due to Southern fears of being outvoted in the Senate, during the 1830s Michigan had to wait on Arkansas being admitted first. In its 1844 platform, the Democratic Party linked the entry of the vast slaveholding republic of Texas to the organization of the Oregon territory.
â€œSince control of the Senate, and more broadly the federal government, was vital to preserving the slave system, any change in the balance of free and slave states presented an existential threat to one side or the other,â€ says Queens College historian Joshua B. Freeman.
The issue remained a tinderbox. After the Gold Rush, California was flooded with settlers and quickly admitted to the union, without having first spent time as a territory. Admitting California required the Compromise of 1850, a â€œcomprehensive schemeâ€ that was again cobbled together by Henry Clay.
The slave trade was abolished in DC, but to appease those who favored slavery, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Utah officially became territories without reference to it, leaving the question to settlers. In addition, the brutal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it clear that African Americans were still legally considered property even after escaping to free states. Presciently, Free Soil Party co-founder and future Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase said, â€œThe question of slavery in the territories has been avoided. It has not been settled.â€
In 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act was a final attempt to maintain sectional balance by organizing two new territories split between the North and South. But its passage only fueled discord and prompted the formation of the anti-slavery Republican Party, with Abraham Lincoln declaring, â€œThe spirit of â€™76 and the spirit of Nebraska are utter antagonisms.â€ The â€œBleeding Kansasâ€ border war over whether the territory would become a slave state became an immediate precursor to the Civil War.

Southern secession meant, among other things, that the region was no longer represented in Congress. The party of Lincoln took full advantage, admitting Nevada as a state in 1864 and approving new territories in the North: Idaho, Montana, and the Dakotas.
In 1889 and 1890, Republicans solidified their power, admitting as states Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wyoming, while splitting the Dakota Territory into two states. Territories with substantial populations that were perceived as less of a lock for the GOP â€” Arizona, New Mexico, Utah â€” had to wait.
â€œState admission was explicitly used as a partisan tool by Republicans who dominated Congress and wanted to maintain their position,â€ says Eric Biber, a Berkeley law professor. â€œRepublicans pushed through a number of states to improve their position in the Senate and the Electoral College.â€
The remainder of the continental US was admitted as states by the early 20th century â€” except DC. Long debate over the districtâ€™s unique constitutional status â€” and Southern opposition to enfranchising black voters â€” kept residents waiting. And admitting the 49th and 50th states required making a new deal to keep both parties on board.
Alaska stops being ignored, while some considered Hawaii a threat
When Trump floated the idea of buying Greenland this summer, part of his motivation was to secure a legacy akin to the one Dwight D. Eisenhower cemented with his admission of Alaska as a state, according to the Wall Street Journal. The problem with that idea â€” okay, one of the problems with that idea â€” is that Eisenhower never wanted to admit Alaska.
The Democratic Party started promoting the idea of statehood for Alaska and Hawaii as early as 1916. By the 1950s, polls showed overwhelming approval, leading the GOP to endorse statehood as part of the partyâ€™s 1952 platform.
Eisenhower, elected president as a Republican that year, wasnâ€™t convinced. He worried that Alaska would be a â€œtin cup state,â€ forever dependent on the federal government for support. â€œThe area was so vast, so uninhabited, so removed from the rest of the nation that it hardly seemed to warrant consideration in his view,â€ according to Eisenhower biographer Jim Newton.

Conservatives were worried that Hawaii would be dominated by the West Coast longshoremanâ€™s union, which they viewed as Communist. (A loyalty oath for public officials was a condition of Hawaiiâ€™s enabling act.) Southern Democrats disapproved of the non-white population of the islands, worrying that Hawaii would send senators of Asian descent who would represent two more votes against filibuster rules that helped them kill civil rights legislation.
â€œIf Hawaii had been settled and primarily populated by Americans from the mainland, there might be no great problem admitting it as a state,â€ Nebraska Republican Sen. Hugh Butler said at the time. â€œUnfortunately, that is not the case.â€ (More bluntly displaying his racist beliefs, Butler also said he didnâ€™t want two lawmakers of Japanese descent in the Senate.)
Given overwhelming public support for admission, Eisenhower decided in the end that a promise was a promise. Lyndon B. Johnson, then the Senate Democratic leader, dropped his opposition to admitting Hawaii as part of his broader switch in favor of civil rights legislation.
Leaders in both parties came to believe it was a fair deal all around, largely because Alaska at that time was Democratic and Hawaii was Republican. â€œThe expectation that Alaska would be a Democratic state forever â€” how foolish we all are when we make these projections,â€ says Gerald McBeath, an emeritus political scientist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Without something for the GOP, Puerto Rico and DC are left to wait
In recent decades, statehood has largely been a back-burner issue. Most of the current territories are too small in population to generate serious consideration.
For DC and Puerto Rico, as has been the case with statehood arguments for 200 years now, the question remains whatâ€™s in it for the other side. And race remains a factor, if less overtly than in the past: During the 1960s, the chair of the House committee that controlled DCâ€™s purse strings responded to a budget from the cityâ€™s first black mayor by sending a truck filled with watermelons.
Puerto Rico has held several referenda on statehood, with public opinion split. Statehood might help with the territoryâ€™s financial problems, while presumably making it harder to neglect in the wake of natural disasters (or for FEMA officials to commit fraud). Still, there are concerns that statehood would increase the tax bill for residents and corporations and make it harder to maintain Spanish as the dominant language.

In 2017, 97 percent of those participating in a Puerto Rico referendum favored statehood. Turnout was less than 25 percent, however, with the pro-territorial status quo Popular Democratic Party boycotting the vote.
In DC, opinion about statehood is less mixed. A statehood referendum in 2016 drew support from 78 percent of voters. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser sees the lack of representation as nothing less than the â€œdenial of our fundamental rights as American citizensâ€ of residents, a majority of whom are people of color, in the â€œcapital of the free world.â€
Residents drive around with license plates that complain about â€œtaxation without representation.â€ DC statehood bills have been introduced in every Congress since 1965. A standalone House bill on statehood received just one Republican vote back in 1993, the only time the question has come to the floor. Although constitutional arguments were raised against the bill, the main hurdle then, as now, was the fact that DC is overwhelmingly Democratic.
In March, the House passed HR 1, a broad election reform bill that included an endorsement of DC statehood. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has called the package â€œa terrible proposalâ€ that â€œwill not get any floor time in the Senate.â€
If the question of DC or Puerto Rican statehood were ever resolved politically in Congress, it would be a straightforward matter to admit them both, says Biber, the Berkeley law professor. For that to happen without sweeping Democratic majorities, however, something big has to be on the table for Republicans, and after all these years, itâ€™s still not clear what that could be.

"All of a sudden, President Donald Trumpâ€™s impeachment is looking likelier than ever.
Grappling with the latest revelations that Trump tried to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Bidenâ€™s family, more and more House Democrats are concluding that Trump abused his powers of office â€” and that itâ€™s time, at long last, for an unambiguous impeachment inquiry.
Their number includes Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced Tuesday afternoon that â€œthe House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.â€

It was a sign of newfound agreement within the Democratic caucus, which has been divided all year on whether to impeach Trump. There are still several who are vocally against impeachment, but by far the momentum has been toward escalating the effort. This week alone, about two dozen members who had previously been on the fence announced that they support an impeachment inquiry â€” and over two-thirds of House Democrats now back one.
Liberals, activists, and many Democratic voters have long argued in favor of impeachment for a variety of reasons, from the Mueller reportâ€™s findings to Trumpâ€™s general conduct in office. But moderates have been wary, viewing the move as controversial and certain to end in failure when the Republican-controlled Senate acquits Trump.
Previously, Pelosi sided with the moderates. Accordingly, while there was an impeachment investigation (of sorts) proceeding in the House Judiciary Committee, the partyâ€™s handling of it was muddled, and it was clear to everyone that leadership didnâ€™t want an impeachment vote.

But the latest allegations about Trump and Ukraine â€” allegations that the president tried to strong-arm a foreign power into investigating his potential 2020 rival â€” seem to be a bridge too far for Democrats.
Which means we are now headed toward a serious impeachment inquiry with Pelosiâ€™s full backing after all. It will be up to House Democrats to decide precisely how they want to handle it. For instance, how much time do they spend investigating, before making a final decision? (Thereâ€™s a general belief in the party that the impeachment issue should be resolved, one way or the other, by the end of the year, and Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler reportedly made comments to that effect in Democratsâ€™ meeting Tuesday.)
Should the party press forward, the final step in the House would be a full vote on whether to impeach Trump. If a majority votes yes, things move to the GOP-controlled Senate, where it would take a two-thirds vote to actually remove Trump from office. That remains a very tall order, given his continued popularity among Republicans.
So unless some truly momentous bombshell emerges in the coming months, Trump is overwhelmingly likely to remain president. But impeachment would be historic nevertheless â€” itâ€™s only ever happened to two presidents â€” and would be an enormous political story. And more broadly, more Democrats are now concluding itâ€™s the only remedy for a president who they think just keeps abusing his power.
The House can impeach a president over whatever it wants â€” though in practice, itâ€™s been reserved for serious offenses
In the view of many if not most Democrats, there are a smorgasbord of corrupt, unethical, and unfit-for-office acts by President Trump.
These acts include (but are not limited to) the apparent obstruction of justice offenses outlined in the Mueller report, the corruption involved in Trumpâ€™s continued ownership of his business while president, his seeming violation of campaign finance law with hush money payments, his bigotry, the administrationâ€™s family separation policy, and general erratic behavior and unfitness of character.
All year, then, the Democratic caucus been grappling with whether all this should merit the most severe remedy for presidential misconduct: impeachment.
â€œWeâ€™re gonna impeach the motherfucker!â€ Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) said on the very first day of the new Congress, in January. (Democratic leaders were not happy, and Tlaib soon apologized for causing â€œa distraction.â€)
Now, according to the Constitution, the House of Representatives can impeach the president of the United States for treason, bribery, or â€œother high Crimes and Misdemeanors.â€ But that last category is famously vague. What is a high crime or misdemeanor, anyway?
The rarity of impeachment shows that itâ€™s generally something Congress prefers not to undertake lightly. Only two presidents (Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton) were impeached in US history, and both were acquitted. A third, Richard Nixon, faced certain impeachment but resigned before that could happen. In all cases, alleged violations of law were involved.
But really, the question of whether to impeach is up to the House. Thereâ€™s no evidentiary standards or necessity for legal grounding of charges â€” itâ€™s a political action. Practically, a majority of House members can impeach the president for whatever they want. If they have the votes, that is.
All this means that the decision over impeachment is inherently a political one â€” and Democratsâ€™ hesitancy over it has, for the most part, been political as well.
Democratic leaders have feared the politics of impeachment
Despite general agreement in the Democratic Party that Trump is a bad president who has done a lot of bad things, party leaders have believed all year that impeaching him would be a political mistake. Theyâ€™ve believed this for several reasons.
First is what they believe is the inevitable endpoint: If Trump is impeached by the House, he will then be acquitted by the Senate. The chamber is controlled by Republicans who have staunchly stood behind Trump so far. Even more importantly, it takes a two-thirds Senate vote to remove the president from office (67 senators). That is a very high bar and would require a massive collapse of Trumpâ€™s support (which is still very high among Republicans).
So Democratic leaders have long thought that impeachment will end in failure and defeat once Trump is acquitted and remains in office. They prefer, then, to focus on winning the 2020 election as the way to remove Trump.
Beyond that, thereâ€™s been a sense that the politics of impeachment would be bad for Democrats generally: The idea doesnâ€™t currently poll well. That assessment has been heavily disputed by impeachment supporters, who argue that drawing more attention to the alleged crimes of President Trump would in fact be good for Democratsâ€™ chances of winning in 2020.
But to understand where leading impeachment skeptic Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been coming from, you have to understand the House map â€” which is biased in Republicansâ€™ favor.
Though Trump lost the nationwide popular vote to Clinton by 2 percentage points in 2016, he won 228 House districts to her 207. So, under the current map, Democrats need to elect some members from districts Trump won, or they canâ€™t get the 218 seats necessary for a majority.
Accordingly, Pelosiâ€™s gameplan for winning another two years as speaker has been to protect those Democrats from Trump-supporting districts (currently, there are 35 of them). She doesnâ€™t want them to be forced to take controversial, polarizing votes â€” particularly when those votes wonâ€™t end up achieving anything substantive, in her view. So she prefers to spend her majorityâ€™s time focusing on broadly popular issues and policy proposals.
But the best laid plans of mice and speakers often go awry.
Activists and voters have pushed Democrats to impeach for months
Until now, there was no unified agreement on what, precisely, an impeachment effort would focus on.
For the first few months of 2019, the consensus among the party elders was to wait and see what special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation turned up. But though Muellerâ€™s report chronicled an apparent pattern of obstruction of justice by President Trump, he decided not to reach any conclusion on whether anything the president did violated the law. That reticence complicated any impeachment push.
Still, progressive activists, pro-Democratic media outlets, and many voters across the country vociferously argued that Trumpâ€™s conduct merited impeachment. And gradually, over the spring and summer, more than half of Democratic House members announced they supported opening an â€œimpeachment inquiry.â€

So, what is an impeachment inquiry?
While there are few hard-and-fast rules about how impeachment gets started in the House, there are two main 20th-century examples â€” Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton â€” in which things really kicked off once the House Judiciary Committee and then the full House voted to approve an impeachment inquiry. There is no formal requirement that impeachment start in this way, but it signaled seriousness and urgency to the effort, and made clear the party was unified behind it.
All year, though, Pelosi fiercely resisted anything that could be called opening an impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile, House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and many other Democrats faced intense pressure from constituents and activists demanding to know why they werenâ€™t moving more toward impeaching Trump.
What ensued was a bizarre few months in which Nadler twisted himself in knots to avoid using the phrase â€œimpeachment inquiry,â€ while also trying to signal that he was conducting a serious investigation that could lead to Trumpâ€™s impeachment.
Meanwhile, other House liberals first pushed for the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry â€” before deciding that they didnâ€™t need one after all, and that a Judiciary Committee probe into Trump that was started back in March could be rebranded as the impeachment investigation their constituents wanted.
It was all a bit of a mess, and Democrats clearly werenâ€™t united on a path forward. Now, though, that appears to have changed.
It took a new scandal to change Pelosiâ€™s political calculus
The months of pressure from activists and advocates set the context â€” but it took new information, about a new scandal, to finally spur party leaders to action.
On September 13, House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) went public with some big news. A mysterious whistleblower from within the Trump administration had filed some sort of complaint, to the intelligence communityâ€™s inspector general. But the administration was preventing that complaint from being shared with Congress â€” even though that seemed to be required by law.

The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, wrote in a letter to Schiff that heâ€™d concluded the complaint was a matter of â€œurgent concern.â€ He also wrote that it â€œrelates to one of the most significant and important of the [Director of National Intelligenceâ€™s] responsibilities to the American people.â€ But the administration was stonewalling. What were they trying to hide, Schiff asked?
A media frenzy, and several juicy leaks, ensued. And while the exact details and scope of the whistleblower complaint remain murky, reporters have nailed down that at least part of it involves a conversation between President Trump and the new president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky this July. In that conversation, Trump repeatedly urged Ukraineâ€™s government to investigate Joe Bidenâ€™s family (specifically, his son Hunterâ€™s business dealing in Ukraine).
Notably, this transpired while Trump was holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid that Ukraine badly needed for its conflict against Russia â€” and while Trumpâ€™s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was being fairly public about his efforts to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.
Rather than years-old conduct about a past election, this scandal was alleged new and ongoing corrupt conduct, designed to swing the 2020 reelection. Trump also has basically admitted trying to get Ukraine to investigate Biden (though he claimed there was nothing wrong with that). As such, it was the last straw for many impeachment skeptics. Seven Democratic freshmen with military or intelligence backgrounds, including several who have hesitated to back impeachment all year, published a Washington Post op-ed Monday night changing their tune. â€œIf these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense,â€ they wrote.
Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) took to the House floor Tuesday and said in a thunderous speech, â€œI truly believe the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come.â€
And now, Pelosi has said the same â€” meaning an impeachment inquiry has finally, officially and unambiguously, begun.

"I canâ€™t pinpoint the exact moment I heard the term â€œVSCO girlâ€ but I know it was on TikTok, and I was pretty sure that it would be a big deal. That wasnâ€™t because I was particularly familiar with suburban high school fashion trends, but because it was a catchy nickname given to largely white and largely middle-class teenage girls, and those things always go viral.
Months later, here we are in the thick of another meme cycle wherein high school subcultural dynamics are explored and consumed by people a decade or more removed from them. Teenagers, particularly teenage girls, have long been the subject of fascination for adults, and the VSCO girl, whose name comes from the photo-editing app (pronunciation: â€œviscoâ€) is only the latest iteration of how we express it.
What does feel novel is the feverishness of VSCO-girl-inspired content that has proliferated on the internet over the past two months: You can read about what they are everywhere from the Charlotte Sun Herald to NBC News. You can hear teens explain VSCO girls themselves in Slate. You can find out how to transform yourself into a VSCO girl on Seventeen and Elle, and how much all of that costs in Fox Business. You can get really thinky about what it means to be a VSCO girl on the Cut and who the VSCO-girl meme excludes on BuzzFeed.

You can read about how VSCO girls are making one 27-year-old feel old for the first time on Business Insider or how VSCO girls are making the brands associated with them feel in the New York Times. You can read about a concerned parent worried that her daughter is turning into a VSCO girl on CBC, even though you can also read about how maybe the VSCO girl is more than just an aesthetic and how theyâ€™re striking for climate change on the Intercept. Or maybe what weâ€™re actually talking about is just lesbian culture rebranded for Gen Z, a convincing theory that you can explore in Vice.

All of the aforementioned pieces were published between late July and early September, a time wherein VSCO girls were a primary target of the internet culture industry, which now moves so quickly that talking about VSCO girls two months after the term first went viral could feel hopelessly out of touch. But the phenomenon of the VSCO girl, while certainly referencing an actual, common style of dress, is far more interesting as a case study in how an entire subculture becomes a viral meme than it is about VSCO girls themselves. There will always be jokes about â€œbasicâ€ teenage girls. Whatâ€™s new is how they evolve with unprecedented rapidity into something much, much bigger.

The easy part is explaining what a VSCO girl is, which is most succinctly illustrated by the things she consumes. The â€œstarter packâ€ of a VSCO girl will likely include the following items: A T-shirt so big that it covers the bottom of her shorts, which are maybe from Nike or the juniorâ€™s store Brandy Melville where everything comes in just one size (that size is â€œsmallâ€). If sheâ€™s not wearing a scrunchie in her hair, sheâ€™ll almost certainly keep one (or three) on her wrist, alongside a bracelet by the Costa Rica-founded brand Pura Vida. Sheâ€™ll carry a backpack by the Sweden-based Fjallraven and a sticker-covered Hydro Flask (cost per water bottle is around $35). The rest of her outfit will be composed of Birkenstock sandals (or any other ugly-trendy shoe, such as Crocs or Fila Disruptors), Burtâ€™s Bees or Carmex lip balm topped with Glossier gloss, and a puka shell choker. The look is at once expensive to achieve and laid-back in practice; a teenager recently described VSCO girls to me as the type to spend 20 minutes making their messy buns look just so.
Thatâ€™s the aesthetic that permeates the actual app: VSCO, the photo-editing software that launched in 2012, operates like an Instagram draft folder. The appâ€™s high-contrast, temperature-warped filters have the ability to make an average photo of a manicure or a cactus look profound, and though VSCO operates similar to a social network (there are profiles and â€œlikingâ€), thereâ€™s far less pressure to curate a perfect-looking or algorithm-winning VSCO feed, since Instagram continues to operate as the public-facing social media self. But ultimately, VSCO is a place to make your photos look good, and the stereotype goes that nobody cares more about making their photos look good than teenage girls.

VSCO girls were always sort of a joke. Way back in January, YouTuber Greer Jones delivered a deadpan introduction to a video called â€œbecoming the ultimate VSCO girlâ€: â€œToday Iâ€™m going to be trying to become a VSCO girl, because thatâ€™s my life goal, you know, Iâ€™m not focusing on college, not focusing on my grades, because thatâ€™s irrelevant,â€ she says sarcastically. â€œI really look up to the girls on VSCO.â€
Back then, becoming a â€œVSCO girlâ€ basically just meant making your VSCO feed look cool; In the video, Greer tries to achieve the retro-flecked, trying-to-look-like-youâ€™re-not-trying aesthetic popular on the app â€” she takes photos of white sneakers next to succulents and says dryly, â€œI think my shoes and the plant, it just really shows who I am as a person and, I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s pretty deep.â€
Like â€œhipster,â€ â€œemo,â€ or â€œbasic,â€ the term is both insult and apologia, something to use in reference to others or sheepishly about oneself.
Sheâ€™s making fun of them, of course, but Greer shares the same signifiers as the VSCO girls sheâ€™s parodying. In a video posted in August of her getting ready for the first day of sophomore year, she wears a basic T-shirt tucked into jean shorts, a choker, and messy bun tied up with a scrunchie, the sartorial underpinnings of VSCO girlhood.
Since then, the most viral parodies of VSCO girls have been by teenagers who could qualify as VSCO girls themselves, making it more of an exercise in self-deprecation than blatant misogyny (although there is plenty of that going on in other portrayals, too).
But what really turned the VSCO girl into a category of person worth explaining is TikTok, the short-form video app, which has become the defining social media network of Gen Z in the year since its US launch. Itâ€™s known for its bizarre comedy and outlandish pranks. Itâ€™s also known for POV, or point-of-view videos, where teens film themselves acting as a character speaking to you, the watcher.
It was early this summer that users began to make VSCO girl POVs, often in which the viewer played the passive role of the new student who had the misfortune of sitting next to a VSCO girl. Sheâ€™d suddenly start telling you about her Hydro Flask, aggressively loaning you scrunchies, and quoting dated memes borrowed from black, LGBTQ, and stan culture slang (â€œand I â€” oopâ€ and â€œskskskâ€). The joke is that sheâ€™s perky and annoying while espousing the virtues of eco-consciousness via conspicuous consumption (metal straws, fancy water bottles, Birkenstock sandals, etc.). Itâ€™s not a particularly new kind of high school stereotype, but itâ€™s one that feels pertinent to the era of â€œsave the turtlesâ€ and social media posturing.
Whereas teenage girls carrying Fjallraven backpacks and oversized tie-dye shirts would hardly have been notable before, POV parodies turned the look into a costume, something for teenagers to call each other despite the fact that they themselves might share the same signifiers. Like â€œhipster,â€ â€œemo,â€ or â€œbasic,â€ the term is both insult and apologia, something to use in reference to others or sheepishly about oneself. Said one 16-year-old to NBC News, â€œIâ€™ve never really labeled myself as a â€˜VSCO girlâ€™ until it really became a trend, and I thought, â€˜Oh, I guess Iâ€™m a â€˜VSCO girlâ€™ now!â€™â€
Itâ€™s been a similar surprise to the brands implicated by the VSCO-girl meme. Since the term went viral, Iâ€™ve received PR emails from scrunchie emporium Claireâ€™s and Pura Vida incorporating VSCO girls into the subject heading. None of the brands I spoke to, however, had seen a meaningful sales bump due to the meme; Pura Vida said that its growth had been steady over the past year, and Hydro Flask could not comment on sales figures (but did say that its parent company â€œcontinues to thriveâ€ and grew at a rate of 23.6 percent in Q1).
For the VSCO girlâ€™s namesake app, the story is similar. In a recent meeting with CEO Joel Flory, he told me that while the trend hadnâ€™t contributed to an uptick in users, he was happy to use the mediaâ€™s sudden interest in VSCO as a chance to sell its mission: It wants to be the chiller, more creative counterpart to Instagram, free of bullying or anxiety or â€œcompare culture.â€ Having recently conducted a survey on young people and mental health, VSCO wants to be the place where kids can post photos and videos without worrying what their friends will think about them.
On VSCO, where 75 percent of its 20 million weekly users are under 25, he says â€œVSCO girls are nothing new.â€ He does, however, want people to know that people who use the hashtag #VSCOgirl on the actual app will reveal a culture thatâ€™s more diverse than what the meme has come to signify. â€œItâ€™s not new for people to reference [VSCO] as a part of their identity,â€ he says. The company isnâ€™t planning on changing its marketing efforts to capitalize on VSCO girls. But he referenced the fact that the only reason he was sitting inside the Vox offices for an interview at all was because suddenly dozens of journalists were writing stories about VSCO girls.
â€œWeâ€™re here,â€ he says. â€œ[There are] doors that have been opened for conversations to take place.â€ In a winking gesture, he and the VSCO publicist presented me with my very own Hydro Flask.
Like most videos, the best ones about VSCO girls are the ones that go all wrong. When TikToker Charlotte Woods and her friends tried to build a perfectly VSCO-esque outdoor sleepover fort complete with fairy lights and printed sheets, they hadnâ€™t prepared for the sprinklers to go off at 6 a.m., leaving their camera-ready hangout drenched and uninhabitable.
Even if the VSCO girl is more useful as a joke than it is an accurate descriptor of millions of teenage girls, sheâ€™s now a part of the cultureâ€™s understanding of Gen Z, a new type of teen to both worship and mock, just as we did 10 years ago with girls who wore similarly outdoorsy clothing, clunky shoes, fancy water bottles, and hair accessories (although back then it was North Face fleeces, Uggs, Nalgenes, and headbands).
Though in both cases, these items can be considered expensive and aspirational, when packaged together to create a label for those who wear them, it isnâ€™t a compliment. â€œUsually, we point [VSCO girls] out to each other when we see them, and we might laugh at them a little bit, just because theyâ€™re so conformist,â€ one 15-year-old told Slate. Another described them as â€œTheyâ€™re just kind of basic and not that interesting as people.â€ This, essentially, is the effect of labeling people at all; any high school dramedy will tell you as much. Like the â€œbasicâ€ girls of the mid to early 2010s, the VSCO girl label slaps any teenager with an oversized T-shirt and a scrunchie with a dozen other signifiers that may or may not apply to her: That sheâ€™s vapid and boring, that sheâ€™s too concerned with how her pictures look even though they look just like everybody elseâ€™s, and that in trying so hard to not look like sheâ€™s trying, she becomes the biggest try-hard of all. And like most stereotypes about women, you canâ€™t really win.
It also isnâ€™t a coincidence that both VSCO girls and the â€œbasicâ€ teens who came before them are often white and wealthy enough to afford their respective uniforms. Mainstream society has long had an outsized interest in what white, wealthy people are doing and buying, and generational stereotypes are, in fact, often based around them: The two most pernicious signifiers of millennials, for instance, are avocado toast and being entitled, despite the fact that itâ€™s the first generation in modern history to end up worse off financially than their parents. Rather than facing the realities of what life is actually like for the majority of millennials who are in debt, itâ€™s far easier to pay attention to the ones making millions by turning their lives into content.

VSCO girls arenâ€™t the first high school stereotype to go viral â€” e-boys, horse girls, and scene kids have all had their day in the sun â€” but theyâ€™re perhaps the ones to achieve that virality the fastest and with the most eager media participation. Even the writer behind the first VSCO girl explainer is shocked by how fast the term caught on. On July 26, Roisin Lanigan published â€œA Guide to VSCO Girls: The Tumblr Girls of 2019â€ on i-D UK, the website owned by Vice, after hearing about the meme by teenagers she was speaking to for a different story. Despite her editor having zero clue what VSCO girls were, the piece ended up being one of the siteâ€™s most popular of the summer.
Now, Lanigan says, the mediaâ€™s thirst for VSCO content has veered toward the cringey. â€œI always just roll my eyes at the pieces now,â€ she told me over Twitter DM. â€œIt seems like for some websites itâ€™s just a way to try to write about Gen Z without really understanding or talking to or identifying as Gen Z. It also kind of betrays that youâ€™re kind of writing about them as though theyâ€™re this strange species you clearly donâ€™t understand.â€
The VSCO girl as meme will fizzle out; it already is doing so, at least according to Google search trends. But the mechanisms by which it originated are only going to get faster and more powerful. Whether we want to continue the national pastime of elevating the same sliver of teenage girls for the sport of mocking them is perhaps worth considering.

"The five-year fight to expand overtime pay to millions of workers is over.
The Department of Labor just released the final rule that will require businesses to pay overtime wages to a much larger group of employees if they work more than 40 hours a week. Itâ€™s a win for the estimated 1.3 million workers who will now be compensated for putting in long hours â€” but itâ€™s a bitter defeat for the 2.8 million others who wouldâ€™ve also gotten overtime under the original rule proposed by the Obama administration.
Up until now, only blue-collar workers and professionals who earn less than $23,000 a year can earn overtime pay under federal law, with some exceptions. That means they get paid 50 percent extra when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The new rule raises the salary threshold to $35,568. Unlike the original proposal, future changes to the threshold will not be tied to inflation.
In 2014, the Obama administration tried to double the threshold to include workers earning up to $47,000, tying future changes to the cost of living. The idea was that a dramatic expansion was needed because the government hasnâ€™t raised the salary limit to keep up with inflation. For example, the $8,060 salary limit set in 1975 was the equivalent of about $50,440 in 2014 â€” far above the current $23,000 threshold. That means that over the years, more and more Americans have been working extra hours without getting paid for them, which is exactly what federal labor laws meant to prevent.
The overtime rule created a lot of drama
Obamaâ€™s decision to double the salary limit created quite an uproar. In brief, hereâ€™s what followed: Powerful business groups freaked out. They then joined 21 Republican-controlled states to sue the administration before the rule went into effect in 2016. The rule was put on hold during the legal dispute. A federal judge in Texas invalidated it in 2017, arguing that the Labor Department didnâ€™t have the authority to make such a drastic change.
Companies were relieved, and workers were furious.
And instead of appealing the Texas courtâ€™s ruling in 2017, Trumpâ€™s labor secretary at the time, Alexander Acosta, said he would create a watered-down version of Obamaâ€™s rule. Now the agency is only lifting the salary limit from $23,000 to about $35,000 and scrapping the cost-of-living increases; that means about 2.8 million of the 4 million workers who expected to get overtime benefits wonâ€™t get them.
Christina Animashaun/Vox
Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, called the new rule â€œdisgraceful.â€
â€œ[This] is part of a growing list of policies from the Trump administration aimed at undermining the economic stability of Americaâ€™s working people,â€ he tweeted in March when the Trump administration revealed its scaled-back version of the rule.
The White Houseâ€™s decision to approve the change is the Trump administrationâ€™s latest victory in its quest to undo Obama-era regulations meant to benefit workers.
The overtime rule has been repeatedly weakened in the past 80 years
The concept of overtime pay, just like the minimum wage, didnâ€™t exist in federal law until President Franklin D. Roosevelt pushed for the New Deal labor protections in the wake of the Great Depression.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established a federal minimum wage and overtime benefits for the first time, was meant to end sweatshop-style conditions in US factories and lift millions of Americans out of poverty. The overtime benefit, in particular, was supposed to discourage employers from overworking their employees, by making it cheaper to hire an extra worker than have one employee work 80 hours in a week.
But the problem with the law, which is the case with most federal labor laws, is that benefits arenâ€™t indexed to the changes in cost of living.
Business groups have been quite effective in keeping it this way, making sure Congress and the executive branch make the fewest adjustments possible.
Thatâ€™s one reason the federal government has raised the overtime salary threshold only a handful of times. For example, in the 1970s, federal overtime benefits covered about 65 percent of salaried workers, according to the National Employment Law Project. Today, fewer than 7 percent of workers can earn overtime.
Thatâ€™s why labor groups pushed the Obama administration for such a sharp increase. By doubling the salary threshold, the new rule would have ensured that the bottom 40 percent of salaried workers will qualify for overtime â€” a boon to many in the food-service industry and others at the lower end of the labor market.
Businesses were up in arms about Obama labor rules
The new overtime rule is the latest example of the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to loosen Obama-era worker protections through business deregulation.
Since Trump took office, the Department of Labor has delayed the fiduciary rule, which would have required financial advisers to always act in the interest of their clients. It has also tried to delay or cancel other labor rules, including one that restricts how employers can distribute a workerâ€™s tips and another that required businesses to share more details of work-related injuries and illnesses.
Obamaâ€™s overtime rule was another controversial one. When the administration announced plans to expand overtime to 4 million more workers in 2014, businesses were outraged. The Chamber of Commerce blasted the proposal, saying that the dramatic rise in overtime costs would put thousands of employers out of business.
Hereâ€™s what the chamberâ€™s president, Thomas Donohue, said at the time:
These added costs would mean fewer opportunities for growth and could even result in a curb on hiring. And employees â€” those who the rule purports to â€œhelpâ€ â€” may gain overtime eligibility, but they are likely to lose hours, health care and retirement benefits, opportunities for advancement, flexible work schedules, and actual income earned.
Employers united against the rule change, though business groups said they were open to a smaller increase. Labor unions pushed back, arguing that the rule announced in 2014 didnâ€™t go far enough. They pointed out that if the overtime pay threshold had been adjusted for inflation since 1975, it would be over $55,000 today.
The Obama rule was finalized in December 2016, and 21 Republican-controlled states immediately sued. Those states eventually won when a judge invalidated the rule in 2017, saying that such a drastic change needed congressional approval.
Acosta promised to increase the salary threshold, just not as much as Obama did. Thatâ€™s why he proposed this latest watered-down version.
To be sure, itâ€™s great for the 1.3 million workers who make between $23,000 and $35,000 and will now get paid for the long hours they put in. Marianna Foral, a social worker for at-risk youth in Omaha, Nebraska, who earns $32,000 a year, was one of more than 100,000 workers who urged the Department of Labor to raise the overtime threshold to include salaried professionals like her, who work long hours for such little pay that they qualify for food stamps.
Hereâ€™s what she wrote in September 2017, after the Labor Department asked the public to comment on the revised overtime rule:
I have 60 children on my caseload. ... I am accountable to greater than 180 people every day. Family problems and crises do not work a Monday through Friday, 9 to 5 schedule with a one-hour lunch break. I can be called in on evenings, weekends, early mornings. I am thankful to have management that encourages I maintain a 40 hour work week for my own self-preservation, but sometimes it is impossible to do that and still give adequate oversight to the families to which I am accountable. This is in addition to the fact that I barely make enough to make ends meet - in addition to the fact that I and other coworkers are using the same social and welfare programs (SNAP, Section 8 Housing) to close the gap between our low salaries and actual needs. Though I love where I work, I speak for myself, my coworkers, and colleagues in the non-profit field who are systematically taken advantage of to work more than our salaries outline though we remain uncompensated.
All in all, the Labor Department says the new rule will transfer about $400 million from US employers to their workers each year for the next 10 years. That should have a minimal impact on businesses. The $1.5 trillion tax cut Congress gave them in 2017 will surely cover it.
The change goes into effect on January 1, 2020.
Correction: A previous version of this article included a graphic that incorrectly stated which workers are eligible for overtime pay."
"Sen. Bernie Sanders has unveiled his plan to directly tax the wealth of millionaires and billionaires â€” and it goes substantially further than Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s plan to do the same.
The proposal would cut the wealth of billionaires in the United States in half in 15 years and entirely close the gap in wealth growth between billionaires and the average American family, according to University of California Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who advised Sanders on his plan. Hitting the richest 180,000 American households, Saez and Zucman estimate the tax would raise $4.35 trillion over the next decade, which Sanders says would go toward paying for his biggest policies, including Medicare-for-all, affordable housing, and universal childcare.
The wealth tax has been one of Sen. Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s signature policy proposals on the campaign trail, what she sells as a â€œtwo-cent taxâ€ on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country: Sheâ€™s proposing a 2 percent tax on household assets above $50 million and 3 percent for households with assets worth more than $1 billion.
But Sandersâ€™s campaign has expanded the idea, with more and higher tax brackets that kick in at a lower wealth threshold.
Hereâ€™s how it would work. Sanders wants to levy a 1 percent tax on wealth above $32 million, for married couples, and then slowly increase the tax for wealthier households: a 2 percent for wealth between $50 to $250 million; 3 percent for wealth from $250 to $500 million; 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion. Same thing goes for super-rich single people, except the wealth thresholds are cut in half. In other words, an unmarried person with $16.5 million in wealth would pay a $5,000 tax, as would a married couple with $32.5 million in net worth.
With more brackets for individuals and families, Sandersâ€™s proposal is estimated to raise $1.6 trillion more in revenue than Warrenâ€™s plan over 10 years. Whereas Warrenâ€™s plan has the same thresholds for individuals and married couples, which could enable some wealthy couples to evade the tax by getting divorced, Sandersâ€™s plan closes that loophole.
As Voxâ€™s Matt Yglesias explained, most middle class Americans already pay a version of a wealth tax: a property tax to their local government on their homes, the most common asset among middle-income Americans. But property taxes donâ€™t get at all the wealth super-rich people keep in stocks or other assets. Sanders also has a proposal to dramatically expand the estate tax, topping out at a maximum rate of 77 percent. Currently, the estate tax maxes out at 40 percent.
Taxing the ultra-rich has become increasingly popular in progressive circles. This is in part a reaction to the drastic Trump tax cuts, which have not led to the kind of middle class income growth that was promised.
This summer, the United States hit a record for extended economic expansion â€” the longest period of economic growth in US history â€” a metric the Trump administration is using as a case for his reelection. But income inequality has also been rising in the United States; rich Americans are holding a greater and greater share of the wealth.
â€œEnough is enough. We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy,â€ Sanders said in a statement.
The wealth tax debate, explained
Income inequality in the United States has been well-documented by economists Zucman and Saez and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics. By analyzing tax data, the cost of employer-provided health care, pensions, and other benefits, they found that income growth hasnâ€™t grown substantially for the middle class and has disproportionately gone to the wealthy. It should be noted, as Voxâ€™s Dylan Matthews reported, the scale of inequality captured by Saez and Piketty has recently come under some dispute. But thereâ€™s little question that inequality has increased in the United States since the 1980s.
When Sanders and Warren rail about the millionaires and billionaires, the wealthy and well-connected, this is what theyâ€™re talking about.
Recently, increases in income have gone overwhelmingly to the very wealthy, not the middle class. Piketty/Saez/Zucman 2017
The idea behind a tax like this is that it would significantly reduce the accumulation of extreme wealth. For one, the tax itself would incentivize wealthy people to, well, be less wealthy in the eyes of the government. As Yglesias explained:
[T]he mere existence of the wealth tax would, on the margin, encourage wealthy individuals to dissipate their fortunes on charitable giving and lavish consumption. If you try to horde wealth the government is going to tax it, so you might as well spend it.
That is both a feature and a bug. But as some experts have pointed out, it might also encourage rich people to hide their wealth. As Saez and Zucman have written in the past, these kinds of tax proposals are â€œfragile.â€
â€œThey can be undermined by tax limits, base erosion, and weak enforcement,â€ the economists wrote in an early September 2019 paper. Thatâ€™s why many countries have abandoned them. As Yglesias pointed out, of the 12 OECD-member nations that had wealth taxes in 1990, only four â€” France, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland â€” continue to implement them. But Zucman and Saez argue â€œthat tolerating tax competition and tax evasion is a policy choice.â€
Sanders does address enforcement in his plan.
He is calling for a â€œnational wealth registry and significant additional third party reporting requirements,â€ as well as increasing Internal Revenue Service funding to enforce the wealth tax. The plan calls for a mandated IRS audit of 30 percent of wealth tax returns for those in the 1 percent bracket and a 100 percent audit for all the billionaires. It also establishes a 40 percent exit tax on the net value of all assets under $1 billion and 60 percent over $1 billion for anyone that wants to take their wealth to another country.
Sanders also addresses a legal criticism Warrenâ€™s plan has gotten: That a wealth tax might be unconstitutional. As with Warren, his campaign is unequivocal in its pushback, citing two Yale University constitutional experts, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott, who have written in defense of the wealth tax. Warren, too, has published letters from more than a dozen legal experts saying the wealth tax is constitutional.
â€œThe reality is that we already have a wealth tax in America â€” the property tax â€” and it disproportionately impacts working class families,â€ the plan reads.
Update: This article has been updated to include letters from legal experts that Warrenâ€™s Senate office released regarding the constitutionality of the wealth tax."
"A whistleblower complaint has led to concerns President Donald Trump attempted to coerce Ukrainian leaders to investigate a potential political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. That complaint has grown into a scandal: At its heart is a question of whether Trump used the power of his office to attempt to influence a foreign country to meddle in the 2020 election.
But while the president has admitted to discussing Biden with Ukraine, he insists â€” despite no apparent evidence to support this â€” that there is another, more important scandal to focus on: the former vice president used his office to help the business interests of his son, Hunter Biden.
The gist of Trumpâ€™s theory: Biden played a role in the removal of Ukraineâ€™s top prosecutor in 2016; Trump, repeating a conspiracy theory popularized by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, maintains the former vice president did so to protect his son. Biden and the Ukrainian prosecutor, Trump claims, is the â€œreal storyâ€ â€” not a whistleblowerâ€™s complaint that Trump improperly used his influence over foreign policy to damage a political rival.
The evidence suggests Biden actually may have placed his son in legal danger by advocating for the prosecutorâ€™s removal because he was widely accused of stymying anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine â€” replacing him could have led to further investigations into a company Hunter Biden had ties to.
Trump evidently sees the conspiracy theory as a way to turn the whistleblowerâ€™s complaint into electoral gain â€” perhaps in hopes of saddling the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination with a Benghazi-like scandal that just wonâ€™t go away. He has repeatedly misrepresented facts, characterizing the prosecutor who was removed as â€œtough,â€ and saying he wants to stop â€œpeople like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.â€
Meanwhile, Trump is facing increasing scrutiny from national media, and Democrats say his actions are grounds for impeachment.
Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian company while it was under investigation
The facts of this story begin in April 2014, when Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company named Burisma Holdings, shortly after his business partner in an investment and consulting firm, Devon Archer, came aboard. Although Biden had no apparent expertise in the field, he had helped Burisma previously as a consultant with expertise in dealing with multinational regulations, and he was employed at a law firm retained by Burismaâ€™s owner, former Ukrainian government official Mykola Zlochevsky.
When Biden joined Burismaâ€™s board, both the company and Zlochevsky were already the subject of intense controversy. Zlochevsky had served as a top official for Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was forced out of office in early 2014, in part due to concerns over rampant corruption. Zlochevsky was accused of corruption as well, including for steering large government contracts to companies he owned.
One party investigating these allegations was the United Kingdom, because Zlochevsky had $23 million in a British bank account that UK officials believed has been laundered. Britainâ€™s Serious Fraud Office froze that account, and shortly after Yanukovych left office in February 2014, sent a request to Ukrainian officials for documents it believed would help in prove its case. Following this request, the new Ukrainian government began its own investigation into Zlochevsky, looking into whether he embezzled public money.
In the midst of these troubles, Hunter Biden accepted a Burisma board seat, and was paid for his trouble, sometimes as much as $50,000 per month. It is unclear what he did for the company. Burisma said at the time that Biden â€” a lawyer â€” would be â€œin charge ofâ€ a legal unit. Biden told the New York Times in May 2019 that this was incorrect: â€œAt no time was I in charge of the companyâ€™s legal affairs.â€
Though none of this looks great for the Bidens, it is, unfortunately, routine business in Washington to hire the family members of powerful officials in hopes of gaining influence over public policy. For example, President Jimmy Carterâ€™s brother, Billy; President George W. Bushâ€™s brother, Neil; and Secretary of State Hillary Clintonâ€™s brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham were all involved in business interests that once drew concern.
Meanwhile, the UK and Ukraine continued to investigate Zlochevsky and other Yanukovych officials, often with the support of the US. But eventually, British investigators began to grow frustrated with what they characterized as a lack of cooperation from their Ukrainian counterparts, saying needed documents werenâ€™t being provided.
The US became increasingly involved in the issue, and by December 2014, had sent a letter warning the new government would be forced to face unpleasant consequences if it didnâ€™t do more to aid the UK. That threat went unheeded, and by 2015, British officials were forced to release the frozen funds, which Zlochevsky immediately moved to Cyprus, according to Bloomberg.
Joe Biden played a role in pushing out Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general
The part of the story that involves Joe Biden directly centers on the ouster of Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.
In February 2015, Shokin became Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, and promised critics of his countryâ€™s anti-corruption efforts at home, in the US, and at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that a clean-up was on the way. And he claimed Burisma was in his sights.
But Shokinâ€™s deputy, Vitaly Kasko, told Bloomberg that the promise was empty rhetoric. According to Kasko, their office did nothing to pursue its investigation into Zlochevsky throughout 2015, and the office was ineffective at reining in corruption generally, leading him to resign in frustration.
Shokin has disputed Kaskoâ€™s narrative, but the manner in which he was running his office also concerned the US ambassador to Ukraine, who said publicly in September 2015 that the office was â€œsubvertingâ€ the UKâ€™s investigation.
Concern at the embassy mounted, and by 2016, officials there began suggesting the Obama administration push for the prosecutor generalâ€™s ouster. In particular, the embassy suggested that $1 billion in loan guarantees the country hoped to receive from the US in order to stay solvent should be tied to a tougher anti-corruption strategy that involved removing officials seen as blocking progress, namely Shokin.
It wasnâ€™t just the US that wanted Shokin gone, either â€” many other Western European officials, including the IMFâ€™s then-managing director Christine Lagarde, also insisted Ukraine was doing far too little about corruption.
So in March 2016, Biden says he told the Ukrainian government that their loan guarantees would be cut off unless they removed Shokin. He told the story at a session at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018.
â€œI said, â€˜Youâ€™re not getting the billion.â€™ Iâ€™m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,â€ Biden told his audience. â€œI looked at them and said: â€˜Iâ€™m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, youâ€™re not getting the money.â€™â€
The former vice president said after the threat, â€œWell, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.â€
But though Biden may have taken credit for it, this was hardly his unique idea. â€œEveryone in the Western community wanted Shokin sacked,â€ Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal. â€œThe whole G-7, the IMF, the EBRD, everybody was united that Shokin must go, and the spokesman for this was Joe Biden.â€
The people of Ukraine wanted Shokin gone as well, and demonstrated for his removal around the time of Bidenâ€™s threat. Shortly after that demonstration, Shokin was dismissed.
Trump hopes to distract from the whistleblower by pushing a conspiracy theory
Trump and his allies have asserted â€” without any evidence â€” that Bidenâ€™s ouster of Shokin was itself corrupt, and specifically that it was aimed at protecting Hunter and Burisma from a corruption investigation led by Shokin.
Trump has tweeted the Bidens are â€œstone cold Crooked.â€ House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has called concerns over the whistleblowerâ€™s complaint as a Democratic scheme fool the public into ignoring â€œwhat Biden was doing.â€ And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has said he wants the Justice Department to â€œlook at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection.â€
Biden spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said all this is nonsense, and that Biden pushed to oust Shokin â€œwithout any regard for how it would or would not impact any business interests of his son, a private citizen.â€
Biden himself blasted Trumpâ€™s efforts to discredit him at the Iowa Democratsâ€™ Steak Fry over the weekend, calling the presidentâ€™s actions on the phone call â€œan overwhelming abuse of power.â€
â€œTrumpâ€™s doing this because he knows Iâ€™ll beat him like a drum,â€ Biden said. â€œAnd heâ€™s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.â€
And despite his boast last year, Biden seem to have played a very minor role in Shokinâ€™s firing. With the Obama administration, the idea to remove him came from the USâ€™s embassy in Ukraine, and the sentiment the prosecutor was hindering anti-corruption efforts was shared by the USâ€™s partners and Ukrainian citizens. Too, removing Shokin has the potential to hurt Hunter Biden given the US had him replaced in order to ensure someone more fully committed to pursuing an anti-corruption agenda â€” including an investigation into the former Ukraine official Mykola Zlochevsky â€” was installed.
Rudy Giuliani has long claimed that these points aside, Biden did indeed do something wrong. Giuliani told the New Yorker that he has talked with Shokin, and that Shokin insists he was seriously investigating Burisma before he was fired. Shokin made the same claim to Ukrainian news agency Strana shortly after his firing.
The question of whether Shokinâ€™s investigation against Burisma was in fact a serious one is disputed, however. His deputy has said it was not, as have US officials based in Ukraine; and according the New York Times, some US and Ukrainian officials believe the former prosecutor was pantomiming an investigation in effort to solicit a bribe from Zlochevsky.
In any case, Ukraine has a new president now: Volodymyr Zelensky, who has also promised to stamp out corruption. And it was in a call with him that Trump reportedly urged him to investigate Joe Biden and Burisma, which he calls the â€œreal story.â€
Trump has now taken that call public, and some Republican allies now hope to launch a domestic investigation. In doing so, he has created a counternarrative to combat questions of whether he committed an impeachment offense in his call with Zelensky, albeit one whose effectiveness â€” particularly given the facts of Bidenâ€™s limited interaction with Ukraine â€” remains to be seen.

"Americans go bankrupt every year because of unpaid medical bills.
Now Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), one of the leading progressives in the 2020 presidential race, says he wants to eliminate all Americansâ€™ medical debt. Sanders released a plan on Saturday to pay off $81 billion in existing medical debt, reform the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill, and set up a public credit registry.
â€œI am sick and tired of seeing over 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because they cannot pay off the outrageous cost of a medical emergency or a hospital stay,â€ Sanders said recently, while teasing the plan he has now formally laid out.
Under the Sanders plan, the federal government would negotiate and pay off unpaid medical obligations that have already been put out to debt collection agencies. He would also place restrictions on how aggressive health care providers and debt collectors could be in collecting payments from patients. Through a proposed public credit registry, which would replace credit reporting agencies like Equifax, Sanders would prohibit debts from medical care from counting against a personâ€™s credit score.
Itâ€™s another big health care promise from Sanders, who campaigns on Medicare-for-all, a national health insurance program that would cover every American. He has also, because he regularly cites the 500,000 medical bankruptcies figure, reignited a longstanding debate about the actual scale of the medical bankruptcy problem. The Washington Postâ€™s in-house fact-checkers dinged him for saying 500,000 people go bankrupt because of medical debt every year, stirring up an old scholarly fight that originated with a 2005 paper co-authored, in a fun twist, by Sandersâ€™s now-rival Elizabeth Warren.
Academics have been debating since that 2005 paperâ€™s publication how many people actually go bankrupt in the United States because of medical bills. It is a debate about causation and study design that frankly wonâ€™t matter to most people. It also risks losing sight of the underlying problem.
There is no denying that thousands of Americans go bankrupt entirely or partly because of medical debt. And even if they donâ€™t go bankrupt, millions more people struggle with this type of debt on their personal ledgers, making it harder for them to borrow money and stay financially stable. Millions of Americans still lack health insurance, and theyâ€™re fully liable for their medical bills if they get sick or have an accident. But even health insurance does not always provide security against financial stress because poor health takes its toll in other ways, such as lost wages.
Bernie Sanders has put out a plan to eliminate $81 billion in medical debt
There is certainly some level of agreement that medical debt is a problem unusually endemic in the United States and our safety net should be better structured to address it.
â€œHealth insurance still leaves Americans exposed to much more economic risk from poor health,â€ Amy Finkelstein, an economics professor at MIT who has studied medical debt, told me, especially compared to other countries with social insurance that better protect their citizens from the economic loss in the event of sickness or injury. â€œEven people with health insurance are not insured against the economic consequences of poor health.â€
And this is part of what Sanders is targeting with his proposal. Here are the highlights:
The federal government would negotiate settlements for $81 billion in existing past-due medical debts and pay off the balance on behalf of patients
Restrictions would be placed on debt collectors: contacts with patients with past-due bills would be capped and there would be limits on the assets that could be seized and wages that could be garnished in collection
Various provisions of the â€œdisastrousâ€ (in Sandersâ€™s words) 2005 bankruptcy bill (which Sanders notes was supported by then-Sen. Joe Biden) would be changed, making it easier for medical debts to be discharged and prohibiting evictions, utility interruptions, wage garnishments, and other practices that can inhibit day-to-day life for people facing debt collection
A public credit registry would be established to replace for-profit credit reporting agencies, providing a report on creditworthiness that would exclude medical debt from consideration
Sanders is making a bet that he is appealing to voters who understand the need to right a kind of moral wrong in the US economy.
â€œIn the United States of America, your financial life and future should not be destroyed because you or a member of your family gets sick,â€ Sanders said. â€œThat is unacceptable.â€
There is a serious problem of medical debt in the United States
Medical debt is a serious problem in the United States. Here are the raw statistics:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported in 2014 that 43 million Americans had unpaid medical debts on their credit reports.
Americans accrued an estimated $88 billion in medical debt in 2018, according to a study by Gallup and the nonprofit group West Health.
Nearly half of Americans fear a major medical event could lead to their bankruptcy, Gallup found.
One in four people said that sometime in the past year they had skipped medical treatment because of concerns about cost.
Health care far outpaced other obligations in the number of Americans whoâ€™d had a debt pursued by collectors in 2014, according to the CFPB.
CFPB
Amy Finkelsteinâ€™s 2018 paper co-published with Carlos Dobkin, Raymond Kluender, and Matthew Notowidigdo in the American Economic Review found that people with health insurance who were unexpectedly hospitalized saw an 11-point drop in their likelihood of being employed and an average loss in labor earnings of $9,000, a 20 percent decline.
What must be said here is America is unusual in this degree of medically driven insolvency and economic loss. Not only is the United States the only developed economy with such a high number of uninsured people (still over 10 percent), but the government does not provide the same level of financial protection to people who get sick or hurt and lose income because they canâ€™t work that other countries do.
The Finkelstein et al. paper used the notable example of Denmark, a socialist boogeyman for conservatives. They cited a Danish study showing that Danes who have nonfatal heart attacks and strokes lose about the same amount of income as Americans, but that 50 percent of their losses were then covered by government disability or sick leave programs.
The US doesnâ€™t have such programs, and Americans only saw about 10 percent of their losses covered if they were not eligible for Social Securityâ€™s retirement benefits. The researchers also found that the drop in income for people in America is not offset by an increase in earnings by their spouse or partner.
In other words, medical bankruptcy is a problem uniquely pervasive in the United States. As T.R. Reid wrote in his tour of international health care systems from last decade:
I asked the health ministry of each country how many citizens had declared bankruptcy in the past year because of medical bills. Generally, the officials responded to this question with a look of astonishment, as if I had asked how many flying saucers from Mars landed in the ministryâ€™s parking last week.
The academic debate about how many people actually go into medical bankruptcy, briefly explained
That doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s easy to measure the exact size of the medical bankruptcy problem in a country and system as unwieldy as that of the United States. A seminal attempt came in 2005 by Elizabeth Warren and, among others, Dr. David Himmelstein, now a professor in the CUNY School of Public Health.
Himmelstein led an updated version of the survey and used a similar methodology as the studies in 2005 and 2009. The researchers sent questionnaires to people who had filed for bankruptcy, and two-thirds said they had medical debt or had lost income because of injury or illness. Take two-thirds of the 750,000 people who file for bankruptcy every year and you get 500,000, which is Sandersâ€™s number. Itâ€™s this number that the Washington Post saw fit to give three out of four Pinocchios for lacking a strong enough empirical foundation.
Some economists have long been skeptical of the methodology and study design deployed by Himmelstein and Warren in their previous studies. Part of it is they donâ€™t consider the survey model reliable; they also question what the proper context should be when most Americans who have medical debt donâ€™t file bankruptcy in a given year. (Himmelstein, for his part, says some of his critics have gotten industry support and that there is a difference in philosophy between doctors and economists on trusting subject responses about issues like bankruptcy.)
Critics will actually cite Finkelsteinâ€™s 2018 paper in contrast to the previous iterations. Those researchers also sought to estimate how many people go bankrupt because of a medical crisis â€” specifically, a hospitalization. They found just 4 percent of bankruptcies could be traced back to an acute event that put somebody in the hospital.
That is obviously a much lower number than the 60-some percent Himmelstein found. The Post cited the Finkelstein paper in its fact-checking column that accused Sanders of â€œcherry picking.â€
Himmelstein and co-author Steffie Woolhandler responded with their own questions about the Postâ€™s evaluation, saying in summary:
Rather than checking facts, the Post has chosen one side in an ongoing and unsettled scholarly debate, and labeled those on the other side (and public figures who cite their research) â€œliarsâ€.
The Weekâ€™s Ryan Cooper pointed to some other studies that found roughly 25 percent of bankruptcies could be blamed on medical debt. But this fact-check drama is at a standstill, with the Post standing by its rating. You can read more of the back-and-forth here. (Margot Sanger-Katz at the New York Times has also covered these issues and this research quite a bit.)
Whatever the exact number, Sanders thinks he has a plan to eliminate the problem for good."
"If youâ€™re worried that the United States will go to war with Iran, youâ€™re not the only one. But based on the events of this week, thereâ€™s much less to worry about â€” at least for now.
Last Saturday, two vital oil facilities belonging to Saudi Arabiaâ€™s state-run oil company Aramco were attacked by what appear to be 10 drones and nearly 20 missiles. The assault shut down roughly half of the companyâ€™s production, hitting the global oil market hard and triggering the largest oil price spike in roughly 30 years.
The Trump administration almost immediately said Iran had launched the assault â€” even though the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had already claimed responsibility for the strikes â€” and shared some evidence it said proved its stance. Iran expectedly denied any involvement, but that didnâ€™t lower the temperature of the situation.
President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that the US was â€œlocked and loadedâ€ for a retaliatory strike to defend Saudi Arabia, while others in his Cabinet said what occurred was an â€œact of war.â€
Despite the administrationâ€™s consistent antagonism toward Iran, that kind of rhetoric from Trump was still surprising, for two reasons: 1) the US doesnâ€™t have a formal treaty alliance with Saudi Arabia and thus is not required to do anything whatsoever in response to an attack against it; and 2) Trump campaigned on getting the US out of needless wars in the Middle East, not starting new ones.
Iranâ€™s top diplomat responded to Trumpâ€™s bellicose statement, warning of an â€œall-out warâ€ should the US strike the Islamic Republic.
All of that is scary, of course. But it increasingly looks like itâ€™s just a bunch of tough talk that wonâ€™t actually lead to a major conflict.
Trump has so far rejected plans from some of his closest advisers and top political allies to bomb Iran. Instead, it looks like the president has opted to increase sanctions on Tehran, strengthen a global coalition to confront the country politically and economically, and perhaps launch some covert operations for good measure.
And on Friday, the Pentagon announced it would send hundreds of US troops, along with air and missile defense equipment, to Saudi Arabia as part of a â€œdefensiveâ€ move.
All of thatâ€™s a far cry from full-scale war.
So while the situation definitely couldâ€™ve led to one of the worst confrontations in modern memory, the chances of that happening remain small.
What we know about the attack on Aramco in Saudi Arabia
Itâ€™s worth keeping in mind that not all of the information about the Saudi Aramco attack has come out. At this point itâ€™s mostly America and Saudi Arabiaâ€™s word against Iranâ€™s, and the current governments of those three countries are not exactly known for their commitment to honesty and transparency.
Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s worth waiting to draw any conclusions until we have all the facts.
With that caveat in place, here is the evidence that has been put forth so far to back up the claim that Iran carried out the attacks.
The US released satellite images of the attacked area on Sunday, showing 17 points of impact on the facilities. Those pictures purport to show that most of the missiles came not from the south, which is where the Houthis in Yemen are located in relation to the attack sites, but rather the north, which is where Iran and Iraq are located. However, one complication is that itâ€™s possible some of the missiles came from the west, so the matter isnâ€™t so clear cut.

US investigators are also looking at recovered missile circuit boards, satellite photos, and more to see if that will help determine the weaponsâ€™ trajectories more definitively.
And Saudi Arabiaâ€™s Col. Turki al-Maliki, a representative for the countryâ€™s defense ministry, gave a presentation on Wednesday in which he displayed on a table as proof of Iranâ€™s role in the attack. He said Riyadh came to its conclusion based on the direction the missiles came from.
â€œThis attack was not against Aramco or Saudi Arabia,â€ he added. â€œIt was an assault on the international community.â€ However, he stopped short of saying the Islamic Republic launched the assault on its own. In other words, he was saying that Iran is involved somehow â€” and that the weapons may have even been mounted in Iran â€” but what remains unclear is if some high-level official in Tehran ordered the strike.

Not everyone agrees with that view, though, including some staunch American allies. Japanâ€™s government said this week that it has yet to see any concrete evidence that Iran is responsible in any way. And while France has yet to weigh in, leadership there said it will send its own investigators to assess what happened. Neither response was a shock, as both Paris and Tokyo have strived in recent years to maintain strong diplomatic relations with Riyadh.
Whatâ€™s more, missile experts say at least some of the weapons used include the Quds-1, a Houthi rebel made and used projectile. That means itâ€™s possible the Houthis used the projectiles on their own without Iranian assistance. The Houthis say they developed the Quds-1 indigenously, and theyâ€™ve launched cruise missiles at Saudi Arabia before, including at an airport. Pompeo, however, told reporters Wednesday something different: â€œThe equipment used is unknown to be in the Houthi arsenal.â€
Itâ€™s of course possible that Iran played a role in the Saudi Aramco attack. After all, Iran backs the Houthis, though the rebel group isnâ€™t extremely desperate for financial and military assistance. And Iran has increasingly made provocative moves in order to compel the US to remove crushing sanctions on its economy, such as seizing oil tankers. One could imagine that attacking Saudi Arabiaâ€™s most important export was Tehranâ€™s way of upping the pressure.
But until more evidence comes out â€” and the Trump administration aims to give a presentation on this very issue at the UN next week â€” the extent of Iranâ€™s involvement isnâ€™t clear.
Trump thinks about bombing Iran, then criticizes those who want to
So without all the evidence yet, the Trump administration has stayed clear of threatening war with Iran, right? Of course not.
Two days after the attack, Trump tweeted that the US was â€œlocked and loaded depending on verificationâ€ and would wait for Saudi Arabiaâ€™s word on â€œunder what terms we would proceed.â€
Trumpâ€™s use of the phrase â€œlocked and loadedâ€ seemingly showed an openness to kickstart another war in the Middle East. But threatening to bomb a country is kind of Trumpâ€™s thing when something bad happens.
Before he began his nuclear negotiations with North Korea, Trump vowed in August 2017 to rain down â€œfire and furyâ€ on the country if it continued to test missiles that could hit America with nukes. And in July 2018, he put out an all-caps tweet saying Iran â€œWILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFOREâ€ if the regime in Tehran continued to make threatening statements toward the US.
Of course, Trump didnâ€™t follow through on any of those threats. But he clearly sees speaking in overly harsh tones as a way to deter an adversary from escalating matters and calm tense situations.
Trump received support from many in the Washington foreign policy establishment for attacking Iran if it was determined to be behind the Saudi assault. Even some of his usual critics advocated for a military response.
Michael Morell, the former acting CIA director during the Obama administration, pushed for force. â€œWe need to respond here, particularly if the attack occurred from Iran,â€ he said during a presentation at George Mason University this week. â€œThat is an act of war, not just a terrorist attack. I think we have to deter Iran.â€
Even Martin Indyk, a former Obama administration Middle East peace negotiator, tweeted on Wednesday that â€œif weâ€™re not prepared to stand by Saudi Arabia after what sure looks like an Iranian-sponsored attack, that will have profound consequences for all our relationships in the Middle East. Including with Iran.â€
The administration has clearly prepared military options. Last Monday, NBC News reported, military advisers presented Trump with a plan to strike Iranian oil or military facilities (among other potential responses) during a national security meeting. But Trump pushed back. â€œThe president, seeking a narrowly focused response that wouldnâ€™t draw the US into broader military conflict with Iran, asked for more options,â€ the story continued.
Thatâ€™s not overly surprising. When his top aides tried to increase the US troop presence in Afghanistan back in 2017, Trump resisted their escalation plans for months. And even though the US was minutes from attacking Iran for downing a US surveillance drone in June, the president called it off because he said it wasnâ€™t â€œproportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.â€
Trump has received heat for that decision, even from some of his most loyal political allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). After tweeting Wednesday that Trumpâ€™s choice not to attack Iran over the summer â€œwas clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness,â€ the president responded: â€œNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just donâ€™t understand!â€ (Yes, it looks like important, official national security debates happen on Twitter now, too.)
So in a matter of two days Trump went from looking like he would strike Iran to pushing back against those that want to strike Iran; such is the whiplash in the Trump era.
Trump will continue to put pressure on Iran
If Trump wonâ€™t use force, then, what will he opt to do? It looks like there are four main options, which arenâ€™t mutually exclusive.
First, Trump ordered the Treasury Department on Wednesday to place even more sanctions on Iran â€” a move he naturally announced on Twitter. Itâ€™s unclear what more the US can really hit, though, as it has already penalized all of Iranâ€™s most important sectors, primarily its oil production.
Even some experts are perplexed. â€œThey could start lashing out at other countries with secondary sanctions,â€ Neil Bhatiya, an expert on security and economics at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, tweeted on Wednesday. â€œBut weâ€™ve basically hit most sectors of the Iranian economy.â€ Whatever the action, though, it will likely further sink Iranâ€™s financial prospects.
Second, the administration seeks to get other countries to work together to push back on Iranâ€™s aggressive actions. â€œWe are working to build out a coalition to develop a plan to deter them,â€ Pompeo told reporters traveling with him to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. â€œAnd this is what needs to happen.â€
It appears to be happening already. On Thursday, the United Arab Emirates said it would join a US-led international effort to patrol sea lanes near Iran to protect shipping. Thatâ€™s important since itâ€™s widely believed Iran bombed oil tankers and continues to seize foreign vessels, including a British tanker in July.
Third, as the administration announced on Friday, hundreds of US troops are on their way to Saudi Arabia in an effort to deter further Iranian aggression. The decision is meant as a defensive measure, but it could become offensive if Tehran continues its attacks.
Fourth, it looks like Trump is weighing a cyberattack on Iran. That would allow him to severely damage parts of Iranâ€™s oil sector, for example, without having to launch bombs at it. While it could prove effective and harmful to Tehranâ€™s economy, that move would most likely be seen as less escalatory than a military operation.
Trump has already had success with cyberattacks. In June, the president authorized â€” and the government executed â€” a plan that impeded the Islamic Republicâ€™s ability to target tankers in nearby waters. Iran still struggled even two months afterward to get some of the computers back online.
One could imagine that a future US cyberattack on Iran would be much more potent, though, causing more problems for the regime in Tehran. However, the secrecy surrounding attacks like that and their covert nature means the public likely wonâ€™t know about it until many months later â€” or if the president decides to tweet about it.
The upshot of this two- or three-step plan is that a full-blown war seems off the table for now. Thatâ€™s a good sign for those who donâ€™t want to see a conflict that could become much worse than Iraq. But whatâ€™s clear from this past week is that US-Iran enmity isnâ€™t anywhere close to over, and at the moment is only escalating. So the situation is relatively stable now, but thereâ€™s a chance it could get a whole lot worse over time."
"The mysterious whistleblower complaint about President Donald Trump thatâ€™s roiling the administration is at least in part about Trump asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Bidenâ€™s son, the Washington Post reported Friday.
A whistleblower who is part of the US intelligence community filed this complaint a little over a month ago. The full details of the complaint remain murky, and it reportedly involves a broader set of events than a single phone call, per the New York Times. But the Trump administration is trying to prevent further details from coming to light.
For some time now, there have been vaguely sourced reports and rumors that Trump was trying to pressure the Ukrainian government into launching an investigation of former vice president (and frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination) Joe Biden â€” possibly by withholding military aid to Ukraine unless they complied.
On Friday, the Wall Street Journalâ€™s Alan Cullison, Rebecca Ballhaus, and Dustin Volz reported that, during a July phone call with Ukraineâ€™s president, Trump pressured him â€œabout eight timesâ€ to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani on an investigation into Joe Bidenâ€™s son Hunter. The Journal did not confirm that any quid-pro-quo involving military aid was involved.
On Thursday, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted that if Trump told Ukraine to â€œinvestigate corruption that affects USâ€ heâ€™d just be â€œdoing his job,â€ and complaining that â€œthe Biden Family... bilked millions from Ukraine.â€ (Giuliani later told a reporter that he wasnâ€™t confirming Trump actually did this â€” he was just saying, if he did do this, it would be fine and dandy. Giuliani has also previously confirmed that he himself has been trying to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.)
If Trump did this, it would be a shockingly corrupt use of his foreign policy powers â€” a demand that a foreign country intervene in the 2020 election to help him by digging up dirt on his potential opponent, or have its security put at risk.
And the inspector general for the intelligence community has said the complaint â€œrelates to one of the most significant and important of the DNIâ€™s responsibilities to the American people.â€ So it seems important.
Trump alliesâ€™ effort to pressure Ukraine has played out in plain sight
The idea that Trumpâ€™s team would try to get the Ukrainian government to investigate Bidenâ€™s family isnâ€™t just theoretical â€” Giuliani, Trumpâ€™s lawyer, has openly said heâ€™s been doing just that.
â€œWeâ€™re not meddling in an election, weâ€™re meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do,â€ he told the New York Timesâ€™s Ken Vogel in May.
Ukraine-related corruption has played an outsized role in Trump scandals already â€” a major part of the Mueller probe was Paul Manafortâ€™s prosecution for financial and lobbying crimes related to his work for a former Ukrainian regime. And back during summer of 2016, when Manafort was Trumpâ€™s campaign chair, he was plagued by reports that the Ukrainian government was looking into his payments. (Manafort was convicted and is serving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence.)
So Trumpâ€™s team seems to have had the idea to try and drum up a similar scandal involving Joe Biden.
The details relate to Bidenâ€™s neâ€™er-do-well son Hunter, who joined the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, in 2014. Two years later, Ukraineâ€™s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was ousted, after pressure from Vice President Biden and other Western officials. Shokin has reportedly claimed he was pushed out because he was investigating Burismaâ€™s payments to Hunter Biden. However, â€œthere is no credible evidence that Biden sought Shokinâ€™s removal in order to protect Hunter,â€ the New Yorkerâ€™s Adam Entous wrote earlier this year â€” instead, the rationale was said to be that he wasnâ€™t doing enough to investigate corruption.
Now, in an obvious effort to cause political problems for Joe Bidenâ€™s 2020 campaign, Giuliani has been pushing the new Ukrainian government (President Volodymyr Zelensky was just elected this April) to open an investigation into the Biden matter, as well as into whether there was any foul play in the earlier Ukrainian investigation of Manafort. Giuliani confirmed he was doing all this to the New York Times back in May, and the effort continued through August.
But Giuliani was cagey on Trumpâ€™s personal role in the effort. He told the Times in May that Trump supports his efforts and â€œhe basically knows what Iâ€™m doing, sure, as his lawyer.â€ In August, though, he told the Times he was just acting as a private citizen â€” though, for some reason, State Department officials were involved in Giulianiâ€™s communications with Ukrainian officials.
Whatâ€™s unclear has been Trumpâ€™s personal role in the effort to pressure Ukraine â€” and whether it involved withholding military aid
More recently, there have been rumors that the effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden involved President Trump himself â€” and that he was threatening the country by saying heâ€™d withhold US military aid unless they complied.
On August 28, Politicoâ€™s Caitlin Emma and Connor Oâ€™Brien reported that the Trump administration was â€œslow-walking $250 million in military assistance to Ukraine.â€ They wrote that Trump had personally asked his national security team to review the program, supposedly to ensure the money was being spent in American interests. â€œThe funds for Ukraine canâ€™t be spent while theyâ€™re under review and the money expires at the Sept. 30 end of the fiscal year,â€ Emma and Oâ€™Brien wrote.
Critics cried foul, accusing Trump once again of trying to support policies preferred by Putin (Russia and Ukraine have been in a military conflict since 2014). And then on September 5, a Washington Post editorial said that theyâ€™d been told that Trump was, in fact, trying to force the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden. The Post wrote:
Some suspect Mr. Trump is once again catering to Mr. Putin, who is dedicated to undermining Ukrainian democracy and independence. But weâ€™re reliably told that the president has a second and more venal agenda: He is attempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Mr. Trump is not just soliciting Ukraineâ€™s help with his presidential campaign; he is using U.S. military aid the country desperately needs in an attempt to extort it.
This raised many eyebrows, because the sourcing was completely unclear â€” â€œweâ€™re reliably toldâ€ â€” and it came in an editorial, not a news article.
The rumors were evidently flying fast and furious. On September 2, Vice President Mike Pence met President Zelensky in Warsaw. At a press conference afterward, the Associated Pressâ€™s Jill Colvin asked: â€œCan you assure Ukraine that the hold-up of that money has absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family?â€ Pence conspicuously did not make that assurance, instead saying, â€œas President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.â€
On September 12, the Trump Administration agreed to let the military aid for Ukraine move forward after all.
Asked Friday morning whether he had talked to the new Ukrainian president about Biden, Trump said, â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what I discussed.â€
But by Friday afternoon, the Wall Street Journal reported that, during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump had pressured Zelensky â€œabout eight timesâ€ to work with Giuliani on an investigation into Hunter Biden. (They did not confirm that any military aid threat or promise was involved.)
Now thereâ€™s this whistleblower complaint â€” but the details remain murky
Amid all this comes reports of this mysterious whistleblower complaint.
On August 12, a whistleblower who is part of the US intelligence community filed a complaint with Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Atkinson deemed the complaint credible and a matter of â€œurgent concern,â€ and wanted the congressional intelligence committees informed.
But his superiors at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence have stepped in and refused to give any details of the complaint to Congress â€” even though a law seems to require them to do this.
Atkinson ended up telling the House Intelligence committee of the complaintâ€™s existence himself in a September 9 letter â€” but he didnâ€™t give any details on what it was about. But in a subsequent letter, he said the complaint â€œrelates to one of the most significant and important of the DNIâ€™s responsibilities to the American people.â€
So House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff went public about all this last week, voicing fears of a cover-up. And reporters have tried to figure out just what the whistleblower complaint was about.
No one has nailed down the whole thing. Itâ€™s at least in part about Trumpâ€™s request to the Ukrainian president to investigate Bidenâ€™s son, per the Post, but itâ€™s broader than any one call or promise and instead about several actions by Trump.
And it has not yet been confirmed that the complaint is about a threat from Trump to withhold military aid to Ukraine â€” thatâ€™s still speculation. But what has unfolded in public view in this whole saga is already scandalous â€” and thereâ€™s likely more to come.

"Against all odds, the unglamorous, top-secret government facility known as Area 51, located in the remote Nevada desert, has become the hottest weekend getaway of the fall. Or, at least, it could be: A tongue-in-cheek Facebook page proposing a mid-September â€œraidâ€ on the place, which some conspiracy theorists have long insisted holds the clues to extraterrestrial life, has amassed the attention of millions since it popped up in early July. What began as a joke designed by an internet-savvy college kid has snowballed into three separate real-life events intended to build on the momentum of summer 2019â€™s most popular alien meme.
Young people looking for a laugh, proselytizing UFO believers, and small-town locals â€” both resentful of the attention directed toward the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, and looking to capitalize on it â€” are all set to descend upon Area 51. But what will actually happen this weekend remains in doubt: There have already been serious economic ramifications and dramatically broken partnerships, amid mounting concerns that any planned Area 51 celebrations are nothing more than elaborate wastes of time.
To say that the Area 51 â€œmovementâ€ has gone from viral Facebook post to a possible disaster, like the Fyre Fest, would be hyperbolic. But to look at the Area 51 weekendâ€™s schedule of events is to see a constellation of indefinites, a series of parties planned by people whose experience in doing so is wanting.
The Storm Area 51 event started out as a joke. Now itâ€™s â€œa possible humanitarian disaster.â€
The original Storm Area 51, They Canâ€™t Stop All of Us Facebook page called for a raid on Area 51 to take place on Friday, September 20 at 3 am local time. The ask: â€œWe will all meet up in Rural Nevada and coordinate our parties. If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. [Letâ€™s] see them aliens.â€
The pageâ€™s creator, 21-year-old Matty Roberts of Bakersfield, California, maintains that he created the event purely as a joke. But that joke went viral in July, spawning memes about aliens moving into peopleâ€™s houses and the military trying and failing to prevent a bunch of anime-quoting teens from entering the premises. Billboard record-breaker and rap sensation Lil Nas X even released a music video for a remix of his hit song â€œOld Town Roadâ€ that heavily referenced the event.
By late July, more than 2 million people had RSVPâ€™d for the joke event. If those numbers, and the Lil Nas X music video, didnâ€™t grant the meme all-timer status, then the US military definitely did. The Air Force issued an official warning, reminding all would-be alien seekers that Area 51 is still off-limits to civilians, and that helicopters and military aircraft would be on hand to turn everyone back. â€Thereâ€™s going to be a force to reckon with,â€ one spokesperson told the New York Times.
Robertsâ€™s joke had already prompted more of a reaction than heâ€™d ever expected â€” the FBI even paid a visit to his home, he told Vox, â€œjust to make sure Iâ€™m not some actual terrorist but rather just some shitposter.â€ And in that mainstream recognition, Roberts saw an opportunity to start a movement. Yes, it was unlikely that even a tenth of the Facebook users whoâ€™d RSVPâ€™d yes on the Facebook page would actually show up in the middle of nowhere for this implausible and unsafe operation. But hotels in the vicinity of Area 51 were getting bookings. If people were heading out anyway, he thought, maybe they would be down to camp out in the desert, collect some alien-themed swag, and listen to live music?
In August, Roberts announced the offline iteration of the Storm Area 51 event: Alienstock, a festival that would take place in Rachel, Nevada, the town that lies closest to the borders of the Area 51 site. The Little Aâ€™Leâ€™Inn, Rachelâ€™s only local business, would serve as co-host â€” a partnership that dismayed other locals and county law enforcement, who felt woefully unprepared for the possible tourist influx. For perspective, even a few thousand attendees would dwarf the actual population of tiny Rachel, Nevada, home to just over 50 people, most of them retirees.

The totally wild, true tale of a meme about aliens that almost inspired a real raid on Area 51
Alienstockâ€™s website offered parking and camping passes for upward of $140, encouraging attendees to pay up and spend the whole weekend of September 20-22 vibing with fellow alien/meme enthusiasts. Itâ€™s hard to gauge how many people purchased tickets; no official numbers have been released. Details were scarce: Roberts said that big-name bands would play, although he didnâ€™t say which ones. The entire event appeared to be relying solely on donations or other unspecified sources of funding to provide water, bathrooms, and security â€” none of which were promised. The only thing any potential ticket buyers could reasonably expect was maybe theyâ€™d meet the guy who started the meme.
The event hardly seemed enticing, and it would very likely be unsafe. Thatâ€™s what the citizens of Rachel argued when they presented a laundry list of concerns regarding the safety of both residents and visitors to their county council, not long after Alienstockâ€™s announcement. Their anxieties ranged from fear of pickpockets to worries that drivers unfamiliar with open-range practices would hit and injure the cattle who roam the area or be injured themselves to the possibility that the influx of people would zap utilities including cell phone coverage, leaving the entire area stranded with no emergency services.
And have we mentioned the nearest gas station is 50 miles away?
Few were surprised when, less than two weeks before Alienstock was set to start, Roberts pulled out of his proposed desert hang.
â€œDue to the lack of infrastructure, planning, and risk management, along with concerns raised for the safety of the expected 10,000+ attendees, we decided to transition Alienstock away from the Rachel festival towards a safer alternative,â€ declared the website for Robertsâ€™s event.
â€œWe are not interested in, nor will we tolerate any involvement in a FYREFEST 2.0. We foresee a possible humanitarian disaster in the works, and we canâ€™t participate in any capacity at this point.â€

Robertsâ€™s original vision of Alienstock was no more. In its place arose something much less exciting but much safer: an EDM show at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center on the evening of September 19, also dubbed Alienstock and co-sponsored by Bud Light. Vox was in attendance to witness Hula-Hoopers in neon outfits mingling among scattered signs and shirts referencing the meme. Scattered attendees held cans of watery beer emblazoned with alien imagery. A countdown clock to the showâ€™s ostensible start went off with a very brief bang: footage of the anime character Naruto and an electronic remix of Storm Area 51 news footage that was shockingly danceable.
Though he reportedly did make a brief appearance, Roberts himself was nowhere to be found.
Alien hunters: Donâ€™t count out Rachel, Nevada, quite yet â€” but donâ€™t expect a warm welcome from the locals
Meanwhile, Connie West, proprietor of the Little Aâ€™Leâ€™Inn and Robertsâ€™s original Alienstock co-host, is still planning to continue with its own event, now billed as â€œAlien-Stockâ€ (note the dash), a three-day â€œOFFICIAL Storm Area 51 Festival.â€ Although Roberts served West a cease-and-desist notice over her use of the name, West soldiers on â€” she even has a lineup of musicians advertised on the Little Aâ€™Leâ€™Innâ€™s website.
(As Time observed, Alienstock in Rachel is the only event that released a musical lineup prior to the weekend. Bands include Speed of Light, a punk band composed of a trio of teen siblings; a band called Brothers of Alien Rock, which fittingly dresses up as aliens and has an entire extraterrestrial lore; and an all-girl pop group called Pynk Leâ€™monade that claims to have worked with â€œDJ Skrillex, Pitbull, Christina Aguilera, TI, and more.â€
Music aside, who knows what will happen at Westâ€™s Alien-Stock? The event remains otherwise ambiguous, but the fact that a lineup exists does suggest some dedication to encouraging partying memesters to stick around Rachel for a few days.
Thereâ€™s no word on whether West has responded to any of the country councilâ€™s requests to explain how her establishment will support the infrastructural needs of such an event, however. (West herself has not responded to a Vox request for comment.)
The official website of Rachel, Nevada, is fascinatingly anti-tourist, warning visitors to stay away from Rachel residents or face armed homeowners, and bluntly telling them to prepare for a miserable trip:
â€œSo far we see a couple of hundred people in Rachel for the botched Alienstock event. Law enforcement clearly outnumbers visitors. There are no vendors and not much of an infrastructure. A makeshift stage was set up on a dusty dirt lot and a few campers are parked around the area. This has very clearly become Fyre Fest 2.0 after the creator of the Storm Area 51 movement pulled out and the organizers started suing each other.â€
Serious alien seekers should consider a different event called Area 51 Basecamp
Separate from the push and pull of Alienstock vs. Alien-Stock is an independently planned event called Area 51 Basecamp. Basecamp is billing itself at once educational and authentically fan-oriented; unlike either iteration of Alienstock, this event has a detailed schedule composed of speakers versed in ufology â€” the study of UFOs. George Harris of the Alien Research Center in Hiko, Nevada â€” a tourist destination some 30 miles from Rachel â€” is hosting the Basecamp event at the center, which offers â€œfun, souvenirs, and UFO information.â€
Among the planned speakers is documentarian Jeremy Corbell, an exuberant character in the ufology world best known for his film about the infamous Area 51 obsessive and self-proclaimed whistleblower Bob Lazar. Lazar is a fairly private man who claims to have worked for the US government on projects directly tied to extraterrestrials at Area 51; in an entertaining twist, it was actually from a podcast interview that Lazar and Corbell did earlier this year that Matty Roberts found out about Area 51â€™s complicated history and was inspired to joke about storming the place.
Corbell told Vox that he helped the Alien Research Centerâ€™s Harris curate the lineup of self-proclaimed UFO experts who will give talks at Basecamp. The event runs from September 20-21, with day passes costing $51; the schedule boasts some surprising celebrity guests, like Kids in the Hall comic Dave Foley (who will have a discussion with Corbell on, presumably, the existence of aliens Saturday night) and DJ Paul Oakenfold performing a show Friday night. There will also be food trucks, including one featuring an alien-themed menu from Arbyâ€™s.
Of all the alien-themed happenings in Nevada this weekend, Basecamp may be the only one that has its proverbial shit together. But no matter where folks end up, remember: This all started because of a very, very silly meme."
"The House just passed a groundbreaking bill that would restore legal rights to millions of American workers and consumers.
Lawmakers voted 225-186 Friday to pass the Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act, a far-reaching bill that bans companies from requiring workers and consumers to resolve legal disputes in private arbitration â€” a quasi-legal forum with no judge, no jury, and practically no government oversight.
These clauses, which are common in employment and consumer contracts, have made it impossible for workers to sue their bosses in court for sexual harassment, racial discrimination, wage theft, and nearly anything else. Workers are less likely to win their cases in private arbitration, and when they do win, they tend to get much less money than they would in court.
Outlawing forced arbitration is no small thing. It would restore access to the courts to more than 60 million US workers who have signed away their right to sue.
â€œArbitration is one of the central ways in which corporate America has rigged the system against middle class families, working people,â€ Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) said Friday on the House floor.
The bill may face resistance from Republicans in the Senate, but pushing it through the House was a feat in its own right. Members of Congress have been trying for years to outlaw forced arbitration in various scenarios: for sexual harassment and discrimination claims and consumer complaints. None have ever gotten through the House, so passage of the FAIR Act is a major milestone.
Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act, briefly explained
The FAIR Act, introduced by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), would ban businesses from including mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts with employees and consumers. It would also invalidate current agreements that have already been signed, but only for disputes that come up after the law goes into effect.
Lawmakers had introduced the same bill last year, but did not get support from Republicans to pass it in the chamber. This time around, the challenge will be to get it through the Senate. But Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham (R-SC), have recently shown an interest in curbing forced arbitration.
If the bill passes, the law would immediately restore access to the courts to millions of workers who have signed these clauses. Often, workers donâ€™t even know that they did.
Millions of workers canâ€™t sue their employers, and they probably donâ€™t know it
About 60 million American workers have given up their right to go to court just to earn a paycheck.
Mandatory arbitration agreements are often buried in a stack of hiring documents that managers require new employees to sign. About half of non-unionized workers at US companies are subject to these agreements â€” more than double the share in the early 2000s. Americaâ€™s best-known companies, including Walmart, Starbucks, Macyâ€™s, Uber, Google, and McDonaldâ€™s, now require all their workers, or some of them, to sign them.
The rise of mandatory arbitration has made it nearly impossible for workers to seek legal justice for wage theft, overtime violations, and job discrimination. This secretive system also has the potential to hamper the #MeToo movement.
Women are coming forward, often for the first time, with stories of widespread sexual harassment at work, only to discover that theyâ€™ve been shut out of the court system because they signed an arbitration agreement. The practice is particularly harmful to women and black employees, as they are more likely to be subjected to arbitration agreements because they make up a large share of workers in the industries that require arbitration the most: education, retail, and healthcare.
â€œWhatâ€™s really happening is that our judicial system is getting privatized,â€ David Gottlieb, an employment attorney in New York who often represents workers in arbitration, told me last year. â€œItâ€™s being privatized in a way that really only favors one side, the employer.â€
But itâ€™s not just hospitals and universities that have gone this route. Silicon Valley tech companies are also fans of mandatory arbitration clauses. And in the wake of a 2017 Supreme Court ruling that allows employers to prohibit class-action claims from workers in arbitration, companies have even more incentive to add arbitration clauses to their employment contracts.
Arbitration is stacked in favor of employers
The remarkable rise of mandatory arbitration in the workplace is the result of multiple Supreme Court rulings that have allowed businesses to expand its use.
Arbitration, which was once limited to contract disputes between businesses, now extends to legal disputes with consumers and employees. Companies argue that itâ€™s a quicker, less expensive forum to resolve employment conflicts, and thatâ€™s true. But there are other incentives for businesses too: Private arbitration allows companies to hide misconduct that would otherwise be made public in court; arbitrators are much more likely than jurors to rule in favor of employers; and arbitrators are far less likely than jurors to give multimillion-dollar awards to workers when they find a company at fault for breaking the law.
Information about arbitration cases is scarce because they all take place outside the court system. But in 2015, California began requiring arbitration firms with clients in the state to publish limited data about all their cases in the United States.
Last year, Vox analyzed the data published by the American Arbitration Association, the largest arbitration organization in the US, which handles about 50 percent of all employment cases. The data showed that the firm handled 8,209 complaints filed by employees bound by mandatory arbitration agreements between 2013 and 2017. Arbitrators awarded monetary damages to the workers in only 1.8 percent of those cases. The vast majority â€” 78 percent â€” were settled through an unspecified mutual resolution.
The â€œheavy veil of secrecyâ€ surrounding arbitration is one of biggest problems with the process, says Cynthia Estlund, an employment law professor at New York University.
â€œThe private and contractual nature of arbitration makes it relatively easy for firms to prevent disclosure of just about anything concerning allegations, evidence, disposition, or settlement of the disputes, not just by parties but by the tribunals themselves.... That means that firms have less to worry about if they violate the law,â€ she wrote in a white paper published in October 2017.
How arbitration works
The first thing to keep in mind is that no arbitration proceeding is the same, as there are essentially no rules that arbitrators have to follow under the law. Thatâ€™s because arbitration isnâ€™t bound by court rules and has nearly no legal oversight. The process can vary from one arbitration firm to another, or even from arbitrator to arbitrator.
David Lichter, a Florida arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association, described the process to me last year as â€œa little bit like the Wild West.â€
That said, the most well-known arbitration firms require their arbitrators to follow certain rules, which they make public, and they tend to have some things in common.
To see how arbitration is stacked against employees, itâ€™s important to understand how the process works. Letâ€™s use the example of two female workers who believe they were fired for reporting sexual harassment to human resources.
The first woman â€” letâ€™s call her Susan â€” was not asked to sign an arbitration agreement when she was hired. The other woman, Ana, was required to sign one.
Susan would first have to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace. EEOC staff might attempt to mediate some sort of solution between Susan and her employer.
The EEOC will review the evidence in the complaint to see if thereâ€™s enough proof to show that Susan was likely a victim of sexual harassment and retaliation. If there is solid evidence, the EEOC lawyers will further investigate the case and try to mediate or negotiate a settlement on her behalf. During this entire process, which usually takes six months, Susan can reject all the proposed solutions â€” at any point, she can ask the EEOC to give her permission to take her case to court. Sometimes EEOC lawyers will choose to sue the employer on the workerâ€™s behalf, though this happens in only a small fraction of complaints filed.

How the legal system fails victims of sexual harassment
Now consider Anaâ€™s situation. She signed an arbitration agreement. She can still file a complaint with the EEOC, but itâ€™s almost pointless to do so because she signed the agreement, so she cannot sue. The only logical reason for Ana to file a complaint with the EEOC is in the hope that her case may be one of the very few complaints the commission decides to take to court on behalf of a worker or group of workers. (The EEOC is not restricted by arbitration agreements, so it can sue and represent workers who signed them.)
The only other option for Ana is to take her claim to arbitration. As in most arbitration agreements, the employer picks the arbitration firm that will hear the case, and will pay the cost to hire the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators â€” creating a potential conflict of interest. (This 2015 investigation by the New York Times describes the often-cozy relationship between arbitrators and the companies that hire them.)
After filing the complaint with the arbitration firm, Anaâ€™s attorney and the lawyers representing her former boss are given a list of arbitrators to choose from. They are usually lawyers or former judges, but they donâ€™t need to have any legal training; there are no laws that regulate arbitration proceedings.
Then the two sides schedule a conference call with the arbitrator to discuss what laws may have been broken, what kinds of evidence will be allowed, how many witnesses each side can call, and the burden of proof that Ana needs to meet to prove that her employer illegally harassed and retaliated against her. The individual arbitrator makes the final decision on all of this.
In the court system, Susan would have months to collect evidence, could compel her boss to share certain documents, and could include as many depositions and witnesses as she would like. She would also be required to prove to a jury, by a preponderance of evidence, that her boss violated the law. She would need to show that the harassment was â€œsevere or pervasiveâ€ enough to create a hostile work environment for her, and that complaining about the alleged harassment was a motivating factor in why she was fired.
None of that is guaranteed for Ana in arbitration. She will likely have a few weeks to gather evidence and will be limited to one or two witnesses and one or two depositions. She also canâ€™t force her employer to share evidence through a court subpoena, and the arbitrator can decide what standard of proof she has to meet â€” it could be a higher burden or a lower burden.
While Susan will probably go to public court hearings with her attorney, Ana will probably meet only once with everyone at her arbitration hearing. It will probably be in a hotel conference room, and lawyers from both sides will make opening and closing statements, just like a court trial. They will introduce evidence and witnesses, but unlike the court system, there is no jury weighing the evidence, just the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators.
Susan, in court, would wait for jurors to decide if she proved her case by a preponderance of evidence, and if so, what her award will be. Ana would go home and probably wait 30 to 60 days to find out the arbitratorâ€™s decision, and the potential award, by mail.
Anaâ€™s chances of winning her case in arbitration are much slimmer than Susanâ€™s in the court system.
Thereâ€™s a reason employers want to avoid a jury
If you ask employers why they require workers to use arbitration, they often say itâ€™s a faster and less expensive process than the courts. Theyâ€™re not wrong. But legal research, surveys, and employment attorneys point to the largest incentive of all: keeping employment claims from reaching a jury.
Juries are considered more sympathetic to workersâ€™ claims, and more willing to award millions of dollars in damages to workers in these cases. The threat of a high jury award also gives workers leverage in negotiating larger settlements because businesses want to avoid trial.
â€œJuries tend to be more generous than arbitrators, so keeping a case in the courts means a [worker] is more likely to get an award,â€ Lichter, the arbitrator, told me.
Research shows that arbitrators can be biased toward employers who repeatedly pick them to handle their cases. This is known as the â€œrepeat player effect,â€ a term coined in 1997 by Lisa Blomgren Amsler, a public affairs professor at Indiana University Bloomington whose research showed that workers were nearly five times less likely to win their case if the arbitrator had handled past disputes involving her employer. Her research involved a small sample of cases, but later studies have backed up her claim.
Alexander Colvin, a labor relations researcher at Cornell University, published a research paper in 2011 that found another level of potential bias: Not only were arbitrators more likely to rule in favor of businesses that were repeat customers, they were also more likely to award less money to their clientsâ€™ employees when they found the business at fault.
Colvin analyzed the outcome of 3,945 employment arbitration cases handled through the American Arbitration Association between 2003 and 2007. His research showed that workers were less likely to win in arbitration than in the court system, and in cases where they did win, their monetary awards tended to be smaller in arbitration.
For example, the median award amount for employees who won in arbitration was $36,500 during the time period that Colvin analyzed, but the median award for employees who won in court was about 10 times larger.
Lichter said there is an unspoken pressure for arbitrators to limit the size of awards for workers who were wronged. Thatâ€™s largely because most arbitrators get paid based on the hours and the number of cases they handle. If an arbitrator gives a large award against a company, it will impact his or her ability to get picked by businesses to arbitrate future cases, Lichter said. But many arbitrators ignore that unspoken pressure, he said, and do the best they can to decide cases fairly.
â€œAt the end of the day, I have to make sure I can sleep at night,â€ he said.
Arbitration has no oversight
While arbitration might seem similar to the court process, itâ€™s not really the same thing. Arbitrators are not required to be neutral, their opinions do not need to be written, and there are few options for appeal, argues Elizabeth Roma, an employment attorney.
The Supreme Court has ruled that the courts would only overturn an arbitratorâ€™s decision based on a â€œmanifest disregard of the law,â€ something most courts have interpreted as an intentional misapplication of the law. That means most federal appeals courts will only overturn an arbitratorâ€™s decision if it involved fraud, evident partiality, misconduct, or exceeding of powers. Thereâ€™s no way for a worker like Ana to appeal an arbitratorâ€™s decision by arguing that it was an incorrect interpretation of the law and facts, or an insufficient award.
Arbitration is not at all like the court system, but the Supreme Court seems okay with that. The nationâ€™s highest court is largely responsible for the rise of this shadow court.
The Supreme Court unleashed arbitration on American workers
The widespread use of arbitration clauses in the workplace came after a crucial 2001 Supreme Court ruling involving sexual harassment.
In that case, Circuit City Stores Inc. v. Adams, a salesperson working at a California Circuit City store sued the company for sexual harassment. The employee, a man named Saint Clair Adams, said his co-workers harassed him because he was gay. But Adams, like all other Circuit City employees, had signed an agreement to resolve all disputes with the company through private arbitration. Circuit City argued in federal court that Adams had to move his claim to arbitration.
The judge sided with Adams, arguing that the Federal Arbitration Act â€” which allows businesses to resolve contract disputes through arbitration â€” has a provision excluding employment contracts. The ruling was upheld by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
But Circuit City took the case to the Supreme Court, where the justices overturned the lower courtâ€™s ruling, allowing businesses to extend arbitration to nearly all employment contracts.
The justices, in their 5-4 opinion, created a very narrow interpretation of the employment exclusion in the Federal Arbitration Act. It came down to this line of the act: â€œbut nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen, railroad employees, or any other class of workers engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.â€ The justices decided that this clause limited the exemption â€œto transportation workers.â€ In other words, only workers in the transportation industry were exempt from these mandatory agreements; all other workers could be forced to take their claims to arbitration.
Mandatory arbitration is particularly bad for #MeToo and workers of color
When women came forward to describe rampant sexual harassment at companies like Fox News and the Weinstein Company in recent years, many realized that they could not seek legal justice in the courts because they had signed mandatory arbitration agreements.
Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson was one of them. She ended up suing Roger Ailes for sexual harassment, and they settled for an undisclosed amount. But Carlson could not sue Fox News for the companyâ€™s role in allowing the sexual harassment to persist, and neither could dozens of other women who accused the media company of tolerating sexual harassment, had they decided they wanted to sue.
As more women speak up about sexual harassment in the workplace, many of them have pressured members of Congress to restrict or abolish arbitration clauses from US workplaces.
In October 2017, Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke (D-TX) introduced the Mandatory Arbitration Transparency Act, which prohibits businesses from including a confidentiality clause in their arbitration agreements related to discrimination claims. In December of that year, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act, which exempts sexual harassment cases from required arbitration.
Then, in March 2018, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and a group of Senate Democrats proposed an even better idea: Donâ€™t let businesses force employees and consumers to take their claims to arbitration. Their bill, the Arbitration Fairness Act, would let workers and consumers decide where to pursue their legal claims. However, they were unable to get even one Republican to co-sponsor the bill in the Senate or House.
This time around, the FAIR Act has far more co-sponsors in the House â€” 140-plus â€” but only one Republican ended up voting for the final bill. The Senate, on the other hand, hasnâ€™t even put the bill up for a debate."
"This month marks the 25th anniversary of the premiere of Friends. You may have heard about this, oh, everywhere. Everyone loves a pop-culture anniversary, but this particular milestone is being celebrated with everything from a pop-up â€œexperienceâ€ in New York City to Pottery Barn and Ralph Lauren collections to light shows on the Empire State Building â€” and the obligatory onslaught of Friends retrospectives and think pieces from every extant media outlet and publisher. Twenty-five years after its debut, thereâ€™s still plenty to say about Friends â€” and to critique, or downright trash.
Full disclosure: I actually wrote one of those many retrospectives, a whole book on the history and legacy of Friends. One thing that became abundantly clear in my research is that most people â€” even those who didnâ€™t really watch it â€” seem to have an opinion on the show. And unlike other popular television series, this one seems to have a particularly divisive effect: People either fall into the camp of â€œFriends is hateful garbage and should be canceled,â€ or â€œFriends is perfect and untouchable and if you say anything bad about it, then you should be canceled.â€ My favorite headline from the latter camp is this one from the Telegraph: â€œIf Friends falls victim to the new cultural revolution, nothing is safe.â€
Forget the Rachel haircut; I think Friendsâ€™ ability to polarize is the showâ€™s true legacy. It has become a way for us to look at (and argue about) enormous societal issues â€” racism, misogyny, homophobia â€” through the lens of a sitcom.
Diehards like to wave away its flaws in one fell swoop simply by calling it a product of its time. And it is! Friends has come to represent everything that was great and shitty about the â€™90s: a time before social media, reality TV, and the reality TV president. A time before 9/11. Also a time before marriage equality and wider acceptance of transgender rights. A time when an all-white New York City was not just plausible on television but expected.
The capital-I issues with Friends canâ€™t be summed up in a hot take, but that doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re not worth examining. So take a deep breath and letâ€™s break down the five most glaring issues with one of televisionâ€™s most problematic faves.

Is Friends homophobic?
In short, yep. Itâ€™s riddled with lazy gay jokes, which was standard for sitcoms of its era. But the homophobia on Friends is also more complex than that. It is truly a Donâ€™t Ask Donâ€™t Tell-era show, full of small steps forward and anxious jumps back.
This tension is perfectly exemplified in season twoâ€™s â€œThe One With the Lesbian Wedding,â€ an episode thatâ€™s equal parts envelope-pushing and full of gay panic. Rossâ€™s ex-wife, Carol, marries her longtime girlfriend, Susan. Ross has a hard time accepting this, which sucks but is relatable; He expresses these feelings by drawing on his bottomless supply of lesbian jokes, which just sucks.
On the envelope-pushing side, youâ€™ve got two women walking down the aisle and pledging vows to one another. Their not-yet-legal union is officiated by Candace Gingrich, the LGBTQ rights activist and sibling of Newt Gingrich (who when the episode aired in 1996 was one of the most visible anti-gay politicians in power). Carol and Susan even have queer icon Lea DeLaria as a wedding guest!
On the gay-panic side, everything else about the wedding is carefully curated to be as cautious and heteronormative as possible: The brides are walked down the aisle by men, wearing long, pastel gowns â€” a decision made by costume designer Debra McGuire, who later explained: â€œI really loved the idea of these women being women, of them looking beautiful and feminine, because of the stereotypes about gay women.â€
The implication was that women in pants arenâ€™t real women but an ugly stereotype that needs to be corrected. DeLaria herself balked at this overt erasure of very real women like her: â€œThey needed at least thirty or forty more fat dykes in tuxedos. All those thin, perfectly coiffed girls in Laura Ashley prints â€” what kind of lesbian wedding is that? And no one played softball afterward?â€
Another thing obviously missing from this wedding? A kiss. The actresses did lobby for one, feeling that going without would be a very odd omission, but producers nixed it, fearing an audience backlash.
It wouldnâ€™t have been a first. Though Ellen DeGeneresâ€™s coming out was still a year away, gay unions and kisses werenâ€™t unheard of: Fox sitcom Roc depicted a same-sex wedding in 1991 (albeit also without a kiss). Roseanne had shown the first kiss between women (in an episode actually titled â€œDonâ€™t Ask, Donâ€™t Tell) in 1994 â€” though it was played for a big laugh, rather than a sincere, romantic moment.
In the end, â€œThe One With the Lesbian Weddingâ€ was removed from the air by two local affiliates (in Texas and Ohio), but it did not create the waves that both producers and network executives feared. After hiring a slew of temp workers to answer the expected flood of angry calls, NBC received two. The episode was one of the highest rated in the entire series. In other words, there was no need for so much hand-wringing.
â€œThe One With the Lesbian Weddingâ€ certainly set a precedent for other shows to follow, and to push the envelope further. Looking back, perhaps the most insidious homophobia on Friends is its desire to make the homophobes in its audience more comfortable.
Where are all the people of color?
Good question. The answer throughout much of Friendsâ€™ run was: primarily on UPN. TV, and particularly network comedy, was very segregated; there were black shows and there were â€œmainstreamâ€ shows, which explains the Manhattan of Friends, exclusively populated by Caucasians and one Asian woman named Julie.
Those who roll their eyes at criticisms of the show tend to argue that any recent hubbub is just 21st-century PC culture run amok. But the truth is that critics raised this issue with Friends from the beginning â€” and from the beginning, the cast and creators were defensive about it, arguing that they were being unfairly dinged because their show was so popular.

During season one, the cast was featured in a Rolling Stone cover story â€” a legendary piece that helped launch the buzzy new series into a phenomenon. David Schwimmer spoke of â€œthe race issueâ€ on behalf of the whole group: â€œListen, the fact is that we could be more diverse. ... But it doesnâ€™t necessarily bother me. You canâ€™t do everything to please everybody, and I know that in casting, they did look at all sorts of different people. This just happens to be the group they ended up with.â€
Compare Schwimmerâ€™s response to the comments that Lena Dunham would make more than a decade later, in response to similar criticisms of the first season of Girls â€” a show set in another borough of New York but an equally white one.
â€œI really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me,â€ Dunham said. â€œAnd only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, â€˜I hear this and I want to respond to it. And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I canâ€™t speak to accurately.â€
Neither of these defenses is particularly compelling. But Dunhamâ€™s comments â€” the first of many she would make on this issue â€” seem a lot more considered than Schwimmerâ€™s one-and-done argument that the all-white casting was a total coincidence, and that anyway, it didnâ€™t bother him.
Thereâ€™s no doubt that most television shows on big networks like NBC were almost entirely white in 1994. (So were most television writersâ€™ rooms â€” including that of Friends. This resulted in far more serious off-screen issues, as evidenced in the infamous Friends lawsuit mounted by black female writersâ€™ assistant Amaani Lyle in 2000, on the grounds of racial and sexual harassment.)
It would have been a significant change for Friends to start integrating more people of color into its guest roles and even extras. But Friends spent the better part of a decade as the number-one comedy on television â€” and eventually became the number-one show, period. If any series had the power to break that barrier, it was Friends. Instead, it took nine years for a black woman (with a full name! and an actual arc!) to appear on the show, when Aisha Tyler guest-starred as Charlie Wheeler.

What if Friends had cast Tyler or another actress years earlier? What if it had set that precedent in the mid-â€™90s? Imagine how different things might have looked on all the many, many series that followed in its footsteps, trying to replicate the Friends formula. To quote another extremely white show about New York, I couldnâ€™t help but wonder ...
Is Rachel Jewish?

This question isnâ€™t often raised alongside the other diversity issues on Friends, but just Google â€œIs Rachel Green Jewish?â€ and you will uncover a whole corner of the internet debating it. Critics Emily Nussbaum and Molly Lambert discussed the matter at length on Twitter in 2014, with Nussbaum arguing that the name Rachel Green alone is â€œunambiguous ... itâ€™s like naming her Shoshannah Lowenstein, in TV terms.â€
Shortly thereafter, writer Lindsey Weber did her own investigation into the matter, referencing the many clues (many of which are straight-up stereotypes, like Rachelâ€™s teenage nose job and orthodontist fiancÃ©) that seem to clearly show â€” but very carefully not tell â€” that Rachel is Jewish.
Itâ€™s become such a hot topic over the years that even Friends creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane (both of whom are Jewish) have been asked to address it in various interviews. In 2011, Kauffman confirmed that Rachel is not only Jewish, but the only â€œrealâ€ Jew on the series, according to halachic law because she has a Jewish mother. Ross and Monica, however, only have a Jewish father â€” though they are both identified early on as Jews. They even celebrated Hanukkah, that one time!

So, why all the hush-hush around Rachelâ€™s Jewish background? And why does Judaism seem to evaporate entirely as the series progresses? (By season seven, Monica is looking for a Christian minister to officiate her wedding.) The answer is gross but obvious: Because Rachel was supposed to be the beloved girl next door â€” not just to Ross but to everyone. And just as it was understood that audiences would accept an all-white Manhattan, it was also believed that they would not (and should not be asked to) accept a Jewish leading lady. That was the case for Rachel and for Friends â€” both the most popular girls in school.
Indeed, it was the case for Seinfeld too, when it was on the air (from 1989 through 1998). That series is right up there with Fiddler on the Roof in terms of Jewish cultural treasures, yet Seinfeld was also critiqued for obfuscating the Judaism of its characters (as with Rachel, there is a similar internet debate over whether or not George Costanza is Jewish). As Jennifer Keishin Armstrong wrote in her book, Seinfeldia, the show was called out as alternatively, â€œToo Jewish. Not Jewish enough. Even â€˜too self-hatingly Jewish.â€™â€
Is Fat Monica fatphobic?
In interviews about my book, Iâ€™m often asked if Fat Monica â€” Monica Gellarâ€™s younger, much heavier self who appears in several flashbacks throughout Friendsâ€™ run â€” would still be portrayed the same way if Friends were made today. Would audiences accept her? I think the answer is a sad â€œyes, the majority would.â€
Fat Monica is one of Friendsâ€™ trickiest issues â€” perhaps because, unlike other forms of prejudice, anti-fat bias is still widely socially accepted. Even unrepentant racists know their views wonâ€™t go over well with everybody. But it is still generally believed that being fat is bad and being thin is better â€” and that idea is reinforced in every form of media, not to mention a multi-billion-dollar diet industry reminding us constantly how terrible it is to not be a size four.
So itâ€™s no wonder that audiences are on the fence about Fat Monica. I grew up as a fat kid and never once expected to see a version of myself on screen â€” let alone a humanized one. At one point, I actually appreciated her because, after all, Fat Monica had a decent career, meaningful friendships, and even some semblance of a romantic life, all of which were things Iâ€™d never been taught to expect, given my hideous size-16 body.
It wasnâ€™t until rewatching Friends in my 30s (when I was literally writing about body positivity and anti-diet culture for a living) that I realized, â€œOh, Fat Monica sucks. Fat Monica isnâ€™t even a person. Sheâ€™s not Monica, fat. Sheâ€™s a cartoon character, with a weird, scream-y voice and a totally different personality (if you can call an affinity for mayonnaise and Kit Kats a personality). Her entire life is eating and pining and occasionally dancing to disco music with donuts in her hands for no reason. Sheâ€™s a clown. And audiences still laugh at clowns.
Fat shaming, mockery, and stereotyping may have gone out of style, but they still persist, on screen and off. Even lauded progressive comedies like Big Mouth treat fat characters less like people and more like tropes. Dramas too, like This Is Us, use fatness as a defining characteristic (and not a positive one). So would Fat Monica still be accepted today? Probably. She might be met with backlash and her fair share of internet think pieces. She might do fewer doughnut dances. But she still wouldnâ€™t be Monica, fat. Sheâ€™d be Fat Monica.
What about Chandlerâ€™s dad?
Yeeeeeah, what about her. This character, and the treatment of her, is the clearest evidence that Friends was indeed a product of its era â€” an era that was awful for transgender people. I think viewers rightfully cringe when they see Chandlerâ€™s dad and hear the way her family talks about her. Kauffman and Crane confirmed she was a trans woman, after Friends ended â€” though during its run, the term â€œtransgenderâ€ wasnâ€™t as widely known. On the show, she was mostly referred to as a gay man, a drag queen, or a cross-dresser. And she was always discussed with abject disdain.
This is probably a good place to point out that Iâ€™m a straight, cisgender white lady, so when writing about these issues with Friends for my book, I made a point of speaking to people who were not. Considering how angry these topics made me, I expected a lot more outrage from people who were directly affected by them â€” especially when it came to Chandlerâ€™s dad. Instead, as trans writer/editor Mey Rude told me, she was â€œbetter than nothing.â€
Rude explained that until she saw the Friends episodes with Chandlerâ€™s dad (who I refer to as such only for the sake of clarity; we never learn the name she actually goes by, aside from her stage name, Helena Handbasket) sheâ€™d seen virtually no other trans characters on TV â€” except for the occasional murder victim on Law & Order. So Rude used to sit in her college dorm room watching the trailer for the 2005 Felicity Huffman film Transamerica over and over again. As a young trans woman, not yet out, she was desperate for a hopeful story â€” anything that might indicate she wouldnâ€™t end up totally ostracized or murdered. In Chandlerâ€™s dad, Rude saw a trans woman with a life: â€œShe has a career, she has a boyfriend!â€ Yes, she is treated like absolute garbage at her sonâ€™s wedding. â€œBut they do invite her to the wedding.â€
Of course, there are other trans folks who justifiably argue that thereâ€™s nothing positive about featuring a trans woman who is used entirely as a punchline for hurtful, offensive, bad jokes. As Samantha Riedel wrote at Them, Friendsâ€™ â€œâ€˜realisticâ€™ portrayal of cultural attitudes toward queerness ended up reinforcing those same attitudes, not driving society forward.â€ (Riedel also observes that in the pilot, when Chandler â€œidly muses that he sometimes wishes to be a lesbian,â€ his friends respond by taking â€œevery opportunity to deride his queer quirks.â€)
Even Kathleen Turner, who played Chandlerâ€™s dad, acknowledges it wasnâ€™t a good look for Friends: â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s aged well,â€ she said in 2018. â€œIt was a 30-minute sitcom. It became a phenomenon, but no one ever took it seriously as a social comment.â€
Turnerâ€™s point is an important one â€” and, I think, key to understanding why Friendsâ€™ legacy is so polarizing today. Was the show homophobic, racist, and willing to reduce marginalized people to punchlines? Yes. It wasnâ€™t any more offensive than other series of its time, and it aired in an era when it was easier to survive scrutiny over issues of diversity and inclusion. But Friends blew up bigger than any of its peers, and its popularity has managed to endure into an era when we think very critically about the messages television shoves into our brains â€” especially television weâ€™ve been consuming for 25 years.
No matter what side you fall on, the debate over Friends is a healthy one. It doesnâ€™t take away from whatâ€™s magical about the series â€” the castâ€™s uncanny chemistry, the fine-tuned jokes that still make us laugh (â€œPIVOTâ€). Rather, it adds something just as valuable. Today, this comfort-food show serves an additional purpose: Friends highlights both how far weâ€™ve come and how much further we have to go.

"In the past year, a massive, predominantly left-wing backlash to mega-philanthropy has broken out. Writers like Anand Giridharadas, Rob Reich, and Rutger Bregman have turned the idea that philanthropy is taking on tasks that are properly the role of government â€” and allowing the rich to expand their influence and avoid taxation in the process â€” into a mainstream critique, one that major philanthropists have been forced to answer.
But the critique has, with some exceptions, lacked a positive dimension: How, exactly, do we transition from the status quo to a world where the rich are taxed enough to shrink the philanthropic sector and the federal government has enough revenue to pick up the slack?
That specificity isnâ€™t just the next logical step in the argument; itâ€™s crucial to the whole thing hanging together. I am persuadable that philanthropy has taken on an excessive role relative to government, but there are still some areas (like foreign aid or reproductive health care) where having a third force besides government and business is valuable. Otherwise, those sectors will underinvest. You need to know the exact philanthropy-shrinking reforms to know if they go too far, or just far enough.
Luckily, University of California Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman have provided just such a plan, in the form of their new paper on wealth taxes. The paper was prepared for the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, a prestigious twice-annual event where leading economists present their most policy-relevant research. And what Saez and Zucman propose would dramatically change philanthropy in America.
The two authors had previously helped design Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s signature wealth tax proposal, which calls for a 2 percent annual levy on wealth between $50 million and $1 billion and a 3 percent levy on wealth in excess of $1 billion.
Those are high rates by international standards, but not enough to make very wealthy people no longer wealthy. The taxes would eat up most of the returns to investments in stocks (which average something like 6 to 8 percent in the long run) and all of the returns and then some to safer investments like bonds. But for the most part, the rich would grow richer at a slightly more modest pace or become only mildly less rich.
The new paper considers even bolder options: A â€œradicalâ€ wealth tax of 10 percent of wealth over $1 billion thatâ€™s meant to gradually draw down the wealth of billionaires, and a â€œconfiscatoryâ€ tax of 90 percent on wealth over $1 billion meant to raise huge sums of revenue all at once and then (by setting a de facto maximum wealth level) never again.
Most strikingly, from a philanthropic perspective, Saez and Zucman propose making foundations and donor-advised funds subject to the wealth tax if they are still controlled by their wealthy benefactor. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation would be treated the same as Bill and Melinda Gates, individually. To avoid the tax, the foundation would have to either (a) put people other than the Gates in effective control or (b) spend its philanthropic funds quickly.
Itâ€™s hard to overstate how quickly this would transform American philanthropy. The first response would be evasion â€” philanthropists would try to use LLCs and other corporate forms to avoid the tax or put loyal aides in charge of the foundation while still de facto controlling it.
But if the tax is rigorously enforced, it would spur a massive increase in the speed and pace of giving. This wouldnâ€™t be a one-time increase either. Billionaires would likely opt to front-load their donations in general, as they would have to donate outside their foundations to get income tax breaks. They would stop waiting to give through bequests or late-in-life gifts.
I worry about this effect a lot. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has argued, itâ€™s actually quite difficult to find useful philanthropic opportunities and forcing people to spend down rapidly could lead them to give subpar donations. Itâ€™s easier to just empty a dump truck of money at Lincoln Center than it is to design an effective anti-malaria intervention.
At the same time, the volume of giving would increase â€” and if giving shifts to nonprofits that arenâ€™t controlled by donors and are thus exempt from the wealth tax, those nonprofits could conceivably take over the task of researching effective interventions and gradually spending on them.
That, to me, is the most attractive feature of this plan, for all the administrative and constitutional difficulties it poses. It presents an alternative vision of a civil society, where recipient nonprofits gain a structural advantage over their donors. My prior is that this would be a positive shift. But this is such uncharted territory that thereâ€™s plenty of room for my prior to shift.
